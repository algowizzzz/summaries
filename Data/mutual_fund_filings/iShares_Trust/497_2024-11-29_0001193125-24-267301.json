Fees and Expenses The following\ntable describes the fees and expenses that you\nwill incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of\nthe Fund. The investment advisory agreement\nbetween iShares Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and\nBlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) provides\nthat BFA will pay all operating expenses of\nthe Fund, except: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv)\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.74%     None       0.00%       0.74%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $76        $237     $411      $918  \n                                      \nS-1\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 18% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe FTSE China 50 Index (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ), which is designed to measure the\nperformance of the largest companies in the\nChinese equity market that trade on the Stock\nExchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) and are available\nto international investors, as determined by\nFTSE International Limited (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c FTSE \u201d ). The Underlying Index\nconsists of 50 of the largest and most\nactively traded Chinese companies. H-Shares,\nP-Chips and Red-Chips are eligible for\ninclusion in the Underlying Index. Other\nChinese share classes are ineligible.\nSecurities in the Underlying Index are\nweighted based on the total market value of\ntheir shares, so that securities with higher\ntotal market values generally have a higher\nrepresentation in the Underlying Index. Each\nsecurity in the Underlying Index is a current\nconstituent of the FTSE All-World Index.\nIndividual constituents are capped such that\nno individual stock represents more than 9% of\nthe Underlying Index and all companies that\nindividually have a weight greater than 4.5%\nin aggregate represent no more than 38% of the\nUnderlying Index. As of July 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nconsumer discretionary, financials and\ntechnology industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby FTSE, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in China . Investments in Chinese\nsecurities, including certain Hong Kong-listed\nand U.S.-listed securities, subject the Fund\nto risks specific to China. China may be\nsubject to considerable degrees of economic,\npolitical and social instability. China is an\nemerging market and demonstrates significantly\nhigher volatility from time to time in\ncomparison to developed markets. Over the last\nfew decades, the Chinese government has\nundertaken reform of economic and market\npractices and has expanded the sphere of\nprivate ownership of property in China.\nHowever, Chinese markets generally continue to\nexperience inefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies resulting from governmental\ninfluence, a lack of publicly available\ninformation and/or political and social\ninstability. S-2 Chinese companies are also\nsubject to the risk that Chinese authorities\ncan intervene in their operations and\nstructure. Internal social unrest or\nconfrontations with neighboring countries,\nincluding military conflicts in response to\nsuch events, may also disrupt economic\ndevelopment in China and result in a greater\nrisk of currency fluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate fluctuations and\nhigher rates of inflation. China has\nexperienced security concerns, such as\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Additionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-sponsored\ncyberattacks against foreign companies and\nforeign governments. Actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity and strained\ninternational relations, including purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. Incidents involving China's or\nthe region's security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and the Fund's investments.\nExport growth continues to be a major driver\nof China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in\nspending on Chinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification, institution of\nadditional tariffs or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions or a trade war between China and the\nU.S. or in response to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any\nof the economies of China's key trading\npartners may have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy. The Underlying Index may\ninclude companies that are subject to economic\nor trade restrictions (but not investment\nrestrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national security, human\nrights or other concerns of such government.\nSo long as these restrictions do not include\nrestrictions on investments, the Fund is\ngenerally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the Underlying Index.\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Fund invests\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they do not meet\nU.S. accounting standards and auditor\noversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund does not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or S-3 other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Consumer goods and\nservices companies ( \u201c consumer companies \u201d )\nface risks related to changes in consumer\npreferences and disposable income, commodity\nprices, government regulation, supply chain\ndisruptions, damage to brand or reputation,\neconomic slowdown and labor shortages, among\nother things. Currency Risk . Because the\nFund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the\nNAV could decline if the currency of the\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Custody Risk .\nLess developed securities markets are more\nlikely to experience problems with the\nclearing and settlement of trades, as well as\nthe custody of securities and other assets by\nlocal banks, agents and depositories. These\nissues may have an adverse impact on the Fund,\nincluding losses or delays in payments,\ndelivery or recovery of money or other assets.\nCybersecurity Risk . Failures or breaches of\nthe electronic systems of the Fund, its\nadviser, distributor, Index Provider, other\nservice providers, counterparties, or issuers\nof assets in which the Fund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively impact the Fund\nand its shareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems. The\nFund cannot control the cybersecurity plans\nand systems of its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. In addition, cyber\nincidents may adversely impact the issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund invests, which\nmay cause such investments to lose value.\nFinancial Companies Risk . Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation and intervention,\nwhich may adversely affect their\nprofitability, the scope of their activities,\nthe prices they can charge, the amount of\ncapital and liquid assets they must maintain\nand their size, among other things. Financial\nservices companies also may be significantly\naffected by, among other things, interest\nrates, economic conditions, volatility in\nfinancial markets, credit rating downgrades,\nadverse public perception, exposure\nconcentration and counterparty risk. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. National Closed Market Trading Risk.\nTo the extent that securities or other assets\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or\nin foreign markets that may be closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrade is open, there are likely to be\ndeviations between such asset\u2019s current price\nand its last quoted price ( i.e ., the quote\nfrom the closed foreign market to the Fund).\nThe impact of a closed foreign market on the\nFund is likely to be greater where a large\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a foreign market\nis closed for unscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that may be\ngreater than those experienced by other funds.\nNon-Diversification Risk . The Fund is\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means\nthat, compared with funds that are classified\nas \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a\ngreater percentage of its assets in securities\nor other instruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties and thus\nmay be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk . Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s S-4 service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Reliance on Trading\nPartners Risk . The Fund invests in a country\nwhose economy is heavily dependent upon\ntrading with key partners. Any reduction in\nthis trading may have an adverse impact on the\nFund's investments. Through its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers, the Fund is\nspecifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk\nand U.S. Economic Risk . Risk of Investing in\nEmerging Markets . Investments in China may be\nsubject to a greater risk of loss than\ninvestments in issuers located or operating in\nmore developed markets. Emerging markets may\nbe more likely to experience inflation, social\ninstability, political turmoil or rapid\nchanges in economic conditions than more\ndeveloped markets. Companies in many emerging\nmarkets are not subject to the same degree of\nregulatory requirements, accounting standards\nor auditor oversight as companies in more\ndeveloped countries, and as a result,\ninformation about the securities in which the\nFund invests may be less reliable or complete.\nEmerging markets often have less reliable\nsecurities valuations and greater risk\nassociated with custody of securities than\ndeveloped markets. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and shareholders may have limited\nlegal remedies. The Fund does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. Securities Lending Risk. The\nFund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-5\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-6\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares\nof the Fund may only be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (a premium) or less\nthan NAV (a discount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the difference between\nthe highest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when buying or\nselling shares in the secondary market (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax Information The Fund\nintends to make distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\ndeferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or\nan IRA, in which case, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when withdrawn.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-7\n\niSHARES \u00ae GLOBAL EQUITY FACTOR ETF Ticker:\nGLOF Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment\nObjective The iShares Global Equity Factor ETF\n(the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment\nresults of an index composed of large- and\nmid-capitalization developed and emerging\nmarket stocks that have favorable exposure to\ntarget style factors subject to constraints.\nFees and Expenses The following table\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you will\nincur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund. The investment advisory agreement\nbetween iShares Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and\nBlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) provides\nthat BFA will pay all operating expenses of\nthe Fund, except: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv)\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. The Fund may incur \u201c Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses. \u201d Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses reflect the Fund's pro rata share of\nthe fees and expenses incurred indirectly by\nthe Fund as a result of investing in other\ninvestment companies. The impact of Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses is included in the\ntotal returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees\nand Expenses are not included in the\ncalculation of the ratio of expenses to\naverage net assets shown in the Financial\nHighlights section of the Fund's prospectus\n(the \u201c Prospectus \u201d ).BFA, the investment\nadviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed\nto waive a portion of its management fees in\nan amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses, if any, attributable to investments\nby the Fund in other series of the Trust and\niShares, Inc. until November 30, 2025. The\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nNovember 30, 2025only upon the written\nagreement of the Trust and BFA. You may pay\nother fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which\nare not reflected in the tables and examples\nbelow.\n                                              \n       Ann\u2026                                   \n       Fund                                   \n       Ope\u2026                                   \n       Exp\u2026                                   \n       exp\u2026                                   \n       that                                   \n       you                                    \n       pay                                    \n       each                                   \n       year                                   \n       as                                     \n       ape\u2026                                   \n       of                                     \n       the                                    \n       val\u2026                                   \n       of                                     \n       your                                   \n       inv\u2026                                   \n       Dis\u2026         Acq\u2026               Total  \n  Ma\u2026  Ser\u2026  Othe\u2026  Fun\u2026  Total  Fee   Annu\u2026  \n       Fees         and\u2026  Annu\u2026  Wai\u2026  Afte\u2026  \n                                       Waiv\u2026  \n  0.\u2026  None  0.00%  0.0\u2026  0.20%  (0.\u2026  0.20%  \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $20         $64     $113      $255  \n                                      \nS-8\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 24% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe STOXX Global Equity Factor Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which is a rules-based\nequity index provided by STOXX Ltd. (the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d or \u201c STOXX \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index is composed of large- and\nmid-capitalization equity securities from the\nSTOXX World AC Index (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d )\nthat are selected and weighted using an\noptimization process designed to maximize\nexposure to five target factors: momentum,\nquality, value, low volatility and size. The\nUnderlying Index seeks to control exposure to,\namong other things, industries and countries,\nlimit turnover and maintain a level of risk\nsimilar to that of the Parent Index. The\nParent Index is a free float market\ncapitalization-weighted index designed to\nmeasure the performance of large- and mid-\ncapitalization companies from developed and\nemerging markets. Large- and mid-\ncapitalization companies, as calculated by the\nIndex Provider, represent approximately the\ntop 85% of the investable market\ncapitalization of each developed and emerging\nmarket country included in the Parent Index,\nas determined by STOXX. The momentum score is\ncalculated from the following signals: price\nmomentum, earnings momentum and earnings\nannouncement drift ( i.e. , the difference\nbetween a stock\u2019s performance on and\nimmediately following an earnings announcement\ndate). The quality score is calculated from\nthe following signals: gross profitability,\nshare dilution, accruals, changes in net\noperating assets, carbon emissions intensity\nand greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG \u201d ) reduction\ntargets. Carbon emissions intensity is based\non the issuer\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG\nemissions ( i.e. , direct emissions from\nsources that an issuer owns or controls and\nindirect emissions from the issuer\u2019s purchase\nof energy) relative to peers in its Industry\nClassification Benchmark ( \u201c ICB \u201d )\nSupersector, as reported by Institutional\nShareholder Services ( \u201c ISS \u201d ). The GHG\ntargets signal is based on the robustness of\nan issuer\u2019s GHG reduction targets, including\nwhether they are part of the Science Based\nTargets initiative ( \u201c SBTi \u201d ) framework;\nthis is assessed by ISS based on its own ESG\nratings data and SBTi data. The value score is\ncalculated from the following signals: current\nbook value-to-price ratio, dividend yield (\ni.e. , 12-month trailing dividend divided by\ntotal market capitalization), earnings yield (\ni.e. , 12-month net income divided by total\nmarket capitalization), cash flow yield ( i.e.\n, 12-month cash flow divided by total market\ncapitalization) and time series normalized\ncash flow yield over the previous 36 months.\nThe low volatility score is based on prior\n12-month volatility, as calculated by the\nIndex Provider. The size score seeks to\nmeasure an issuer\u2019s market capitalization\nrelative to other companies in the Parent\nIndex. The maximum weight of a single security\nis 10%, and the sum of security weights that\nare individually greater than 4.5% must be\nless than 22.5% of the Underlying Index. The\nIndex Provider also applies other constraints,\nsuch as country and sector exposures relative\nto the Parent Index, among others. The\nUnderlying Index is reviewed and rebalanced\nquarterly. As of July 31, 2024, the Underlying\nIndex consisted of approximately 636\nconstituents from companies in the following\ncountries or regions: Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China,\nColombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt,\nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong,\nHungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines,\nPoland, Portugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,\nSingapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,\nSweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey,\nthe United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom\n(the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) and the U.S. As of July 31,\n2024, a significant portion of the Underlying\nIndex is represented by securities of\ncompanies in the consumer discretionary and\ntechnology industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the S-9 purposes of\ncalculating the percentage of investments\nincluded in the Underlying Index. The Fund\nseeks to track the investment results of the\nUnderlying Index before fees and expenses of\nthe Fund. The Fund may lend securities\nrepresenting up to one-third of the value of\nthe Fund's total assets (including the value\nof any collateral received). The Underlying\nIndex and Parent Index are sponsored by STOXX,\nwhich is independent of the Fund and BFA. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk . Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to\ndifferent legal, regulatory, political,\neconomic, and market risks than securities\nissued by U.S. issuers. These risks include\ngreater market volatility, less market\nliquidity, higher transaction costs,\nexpropriation, confiscatory taxation, adverse\nchanges in foreign investment or currency\ncontrol regulations, restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. Style\nFactors Risk . Each of the five equity style\nfactors ( i.e ., momentum, quality, value, low\nvolatility and low size) that determine the\nweight of each component security in the\nUnderlying Index has characteristics that may\ncause the Fund to underperform the Parent\nIndex or the market as a whole. Momentum\nFactor Risk . Securities that previously\nexhibited greater momentum characteristics may\nnot continue to experience positive momentum,\nand such a change could occur quickly.\nMomentum securities may experience more\nvolatility than the market as a whole. Quality\nFactor Risk . Securities that previously\nexhibited greater quality characteristics than\nother securities may not continue to be\nquality securities. Many factors can impact a\nsecurity\u2019s quality and performance, and such\nfactors and their impact may be difficult to\npredict. Value Factor Risk . Value securities\nare those issued by companies that may be\nperceived as undervalued. Such securities may\ndecline in price or fail to appreciate for\nlong periods of time, and they may never\nrealize their full potential value. Low\nVolatility Factor Risk . Low volatility\nsecurities may underperform the broader market\nduring periods of strong, rising or\nspeculative stock prices. The prices of such\nsecurities may not be any less volatile (and\ncould be more volatile) than the market as a\nwhole. Low Size Factor Risk . Companies with\nrelatively smaller market capitalization\nwithin the Fund\u2019s capitalization range may be\nless stable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. Low size securities may be more\nvolatile and less liquid than securities on\nthe larger end of the Fund\u2019s capitalization\nrange. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse S-10 impact\non the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual\nmarket conditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural disasters,\npolitical unrest or war) may impact the Index\nProvider or a third-party data provider and\ncould cause the Index Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance. This could cause the\nUnderlying Index to vary from its normal or\nexpected composition. Asset Class Risk. The\nsecurities and other assets in the Underlying\nIndex or in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may\nunderperform in comparison to financial\nmarkets generally, a particular financial\nmarket, another index, or other asset classes.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk. An\n\u201c Authorized Participant \u201d is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof creation units ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only\nan Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Consumer goods and\nservices companies ( \u201c consumer companies \u201d )\nface risks related to changes in consumer\npreferences and disposable income, commodity\nprices, government regulation, supply chain\ndisruptions, damage to brand or reputation,\neconomic slowdown and labor shortages, among\nother things. Currency Risk . Because the\nFund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the\nNAV could decline if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. ESG Risk. To the\nextent that the Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. The Underlying Index\u2019s use\nof ESG criteria may result in the Fund\ninvesting in, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Issuer Risk . The performance of\nthe Fund depends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other assets to which\nthe Fund has exposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, S-11 which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Operational Risk . The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited\nto, human error, processing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders, counterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk . The Fund invests in\ncountries or regions whose economies are\nheavily dependent upon trading with key\npartners. Any reduction in this trading may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund's\ninvestments. Risk of Investing in China .\nInvestments in Chinese securities, including\ncertain Hong Kong-listed and U.S.-listed\nsecurities, subject the Fund to risks specific\nto China. China may be subject to considerable\ndegrees of economic, political and social\ninstability. China is an emerging market and\ndemonstrates significantly higher volatility\nfrom time to time in comparison to developed\nmarkets. Over the last few decades, the\nChinese government has undertaken reform of\neconomic and market practices and has expanded\nthe sphere of private ownership of property in\nChina. However, Chinese markets generally\ncontinue to experience inefficiency,\nvolatility and pricing anomalies resulting\nfrom governmental influence, a lack of\npublicly available information and/or\npolitical and social instability. Chinese\ncompanies are also subject to the risk that\nChinese authorities can intervene in their\noperations and structure. Internal social\nunrest or confrontations with neighboring\ncountries, including military conflicts in\nresponse to such events, may also disrupt\neconomic development in China and result in a\ngreater risk of currency fluctuations,\ncurrency non-convertibility, interest rate\nfluctuations and higher rates of inflation.\nChina has experienced security concerns, such\nas terrorism and strained international\nrelations. Additionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-sponsored\ncyberattacks against foreign companies and\nforeign governments. Actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity and strained\ninternational relations, including purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. Incidents involving China's or\nthe region's security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and the Fund's investments.\nExport growth continues to be a major driver\nof China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in\nspending on Chinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification, institution of\nadditional tariffs or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions or a trade war between China and the\nU.S. or in response to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any\nof the economies of China's key trading\npartners may have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy. The Underlying Index may\ninclude companies that are subject to economic\nor trade restrictions (but not investment\nrestrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national security, human\nrights or other concerns of such government.\nSo long as these restrictions do not include\nrestrictions on investments, the Fund is\ngenerally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the Underlying Index.\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Fund invests\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they do not meet\nU.S. accounting standards and auditor\noversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nS-12 limited legal remedies. The Fund does not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. Risk of Investing\nin Developed Countries . The Fund\u2019s investment\nin developed country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and have\ngenerally experienced slower economic growth\nthan some less developed countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nIn addition, developed countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to the economic\nconditions of certain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price\nor availability of certain commodities. Risk\nof Investing in Russia. Investing in Russian\nsecurities involves significant risks,\nincluding legal, regulatory, currency and\neconomic risks that are specific to Russia. In\naddition, investing in Russian securities\ninvolves risks associated with the settlement\nof portfolio transactions and loss of the\nFund\u2019s ownership rights in its portfolio\nsecurities as a result of the system of share\nregistration and custody in Russia.\nGovernments, including the U.S., the U.K., the\nE.U., and many other countries have imposed\neconomic sanctions on certain Russian\nindividuals and Russian corporate and banking\nentities, and jurisdictions may also institute\nbroader sanctions on Russia. Russia has issued\na number of countersanctions, some of which\nrestrict the distribution of profits by\nlimited liability companies (e.g., dividends),\nand prohibit Russian persons from entering\ninto transactions with designated persons from\n\u201c unfriendly states \u201d as well as the export of\nraw materials or other products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons. Russia launched a\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies, or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia\u2019s\neconomy and Russian companies in which the\nFund invests. Actual and threatened responses\nto Russian military action may also impact the\nmarkets for certain Russian commodities, such\nas oil and natural gas, as well as other\nsectors of the Russian economy, and are likely\nto have collateral impacts on such sectors\nglobally. Russian companies may be unable to\npay dividends and, if they pay dividends, the\nFund may be unable to receive them. As a\nresult of sanctions, the Fund is currently\nrestricted from trading in Russian securities,\nincluding those in its portfolio, and the\nUnderlying Index has removed Russian\nsecurities. It is unknown when, or if,\nsanctions may be lifted or the Fund\u2019s ability\nto trade in Russian securities will resume.\nRisk of Investing in Saudi Arabia . Investing\nin Saudi Arabian issuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that are specific\nto Saudi Arabia. The economy of Saudi Arabia\nis dominated by petroleum exports. A sustained\ndecrease in petroleum prices could have a\nnegative impact on all aspects of the economy.\nInvestments in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers involve risks not typically associated\nwith investments in securities of issuers in\nmore developed countries, which may negatively\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s investments.\nSuch heightened risks may include, among\nothers, the expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets, restrictions on and\ngovernment intervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict, crime and instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Instability in the\nMiddle East region could adversely impact the\neconomy of Saudi Arabia, and there is no\nassurance of political stability in Saudi\nArabia. The ability of foreign investors to\ninvest in the securities of Saudi Arabian\ncompanies could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership of such securities. There\nare a number of ways to conduct transactions\nin equity securities in the Saudi Arabian\nmarket. The Fund generally expects to transact\nin a manner so that it is not limited by Saudi\nArabian regulations to a single broker.\nHowever, there may be a limited number of\nbrokers who can provide services to the Fund,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the\nprices, quantity or timing of Fund\ntransactions. Securities Lending Risk. The\nFund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences S-13\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-14\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Index\nreturns beginning on March 1, 2023 reflect the\nperformance of the STOXX Global Equity Factor\nIndex, which, effective as of March 1, 2023,\nreplaced the MSCI ACWI Diversified Multiple-\nFactor Index as the Underlying Index of the\nFund. After-tax returns in the table above are\ncalculated using the historical highest\nindividual U.S. federal marginal income tax\nrates and do not reflect the impact of state\nor local taxes. Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-15\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2015. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-16\n\niSHARES \u00ae INTERNATIONAL EQUITY FACTOR ETF\nTicker: INTF Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca\nInvestment Objective The iShares International\nEquity Factor ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to\ntrack the investment results of an index\ncomposed of global developed market large- and\nmid-capitalization stocks, excluding the U.S.,\nthat have favorable exposure to target style\nfactors subject to constraints. Fees and\nExpenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the tables and examples\nbelow.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026             Total       \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExp\u2026  AnnualFun\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.15%     None       0.01%      0.16%       \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. Example. This\nExample is intended to help you compare the\ncost of owning shares of the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of those\nperiods. The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses remain the same.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $16         $52      $90      $205  \n                                      \nS-17\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 22% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe STOXX International Equity Factor Index\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which is a rules-\nbased equity index provided by STOXX Ltd. (the\n\u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c STOXX \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index is composed of large-, mid-,\nand small-capitalization equity securities\nfrom the STOXX Global 1800 ex USA index (the \u201c\nParent Index \u201d ) that are selected and\nweighted using an optimization process\ndesigned to maximize exposure to five target\nfactors: momentum, quality, value, low\nvolatility and size. The Underlying Index also\nseeks to mitigate exposure to unintended\nsystematic exposures, limit turnover and\nmaintain a level of risk similar to that of\nthe Parent Index. The Parent Index measures\nthe performance of the largest companies of\nthe developed equity market excluding the\nU.S., as defined by the Index Provider. The\nmomentum score is calculated from the\nfollowing signals: price momentum, earnings\nmomentum and earnings announcement drift (\ni.e. , the difference between a stock\u2019s\nperformance on and immediately following an\nearnings announcement date). The quality score\nis calculated from the following signals:\ngross profitability, share dilution, accruals,\nchanges in net operating assets, carbon\nemissions intensity and greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG\n\u201d ) reduction targets. Carbon emissions\nintensity is based on the issuer\u2019s Scope 1 and\nScope 2 GHG emissions ( i.e. , direct\nemissions from sources that an issuer owns or\ncontrols and indirect emissions from the\nissuer\u2019s purchase of energy) relative to peers\nin its Industry Classification Benchmark ( \u201c\nICB \u201d ) Supersector, as reported by\nInstitutional Shareholder Services ( \u201c ISS \u201d\n). The GHG targets signal is based on the\nrobustness of an issuer's GHG reduction\ntargets, including whether they are part of\nthe Science Based Targets initiative ( \u201c SBTi\n\u201d ) framework; this is assessed by ISS based\non its own ESG ratings data and SBTi data. The\nvalue score is calculated from the following\nsignals: current book value-to-price ratio,\ndividend yield ( i.e. , 12-month trailing\ndividend divided by total market\ncapitalization), earnings yield ( i.e. ,\n12-month net income divided by total market\ncapitalization), cash flow yield ( i.e. ,\n12-month cash flow divided by total market\ncapitalization) and time series normalized\ncash flow yield over the previous 36 months.\nThe low volatility score is based on prior\n12-month volatility, as calculated by the\nIndex Provider. The size score seeks to\nmeasure an issuer\u2019s market capitalization\nrelative to other companies in the Parent\nIndex. The maximum weight of a single security\nis 10%, and the sum of security weights that\nare individually greater than 4.5% must be\nless than 22.5% of the Underlying Index. The\nIndex Provider also applies other constraints,\nsuch as country and sector exposures relative\nto the Parent Index, among others. The\nUnderlying Index is reviewed and rebalanced\nquarterly. As of July 31, 2024, the Underlying\nIndex consisted of approximately 442\nconstituents from companies from the following\ncountries or regions: Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain,\nSweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom\n(the \u201c U.K. \u201d ). As of July 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nconsumer discretionary, financials and\nindustrials industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by STOXX, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider S-18 determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Securities issued\nby non-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and European Economic Risk . Style\nFactors Risk . Each of the five equity style\nfactors ( i.e ., momentum, quality, value, low\nvolatility and low size) that determine the\nweight of each component security in the\nUnderlying Index has characteristics that may\ncause the Fund to underperform the Parent\nIndex or the market as a whole. Momentum\nFactor Risk . Securities that previously\nexhibited greater momentum characteristics may\nnot continue to experience positive momentum,\nand such a change could occur quickly.\nMomentum securities may experience more\nvolatility than the market as a whole. Quality\nFactor Risk . Securities that previously\nexhibited greater quality characteristics than\nother securities may not continue to be\nquality securities. Many factors can impact a\nsecurity\u2019s quality and performance, and such\nfactors and their impact may be difficult to\npredict. Value Factor Risk . Value securities\nare those issued by companies that may be\nperceived as undervalued. Such securities may\ndecline in price or fail to appreciate for\nlong periods of time, and they may never\nrealize their full potential value. Low\nVolatility Factor Risk . Low volatility\nsecurities may underperform the broader market\nduring periods of strong, rising or\nspeculative stock prices. The prices of such\nsecurities may not be any less volatile (and\ncould be more volatile) than the market as a\nwhole. Low Size Factor Risk . Companies with\nrelatively smaller market capitalization\nwithin the Fund\u2019s capitalization range may be\nless stable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. Low size securities may be more\nvolatile and less liquid than securities on\nthe larger end of the Fund\u2019s capitalization\nrange. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized S-19 Participant to place orders\nfor the purchase and redemption of creation\nunits ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage in creation\nor redemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Consumer goods and\nservices companies ( \u201c consumer companies \u201d )\nface risks related to changes in consumer\npreferences and disposable income, commodity\nprices, government regulation, supply chain\ndisruptions, damage to brand or reputation,\neconomic slowdown and labor shortages, among\nother things. Currency Risk . Because the\nFund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the\nNAV could decline if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. ESG Risk. To the\nextent that the Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. The Underlying Index\u2019s use\nof ESG criteria may result in the Fund\ninvesting in, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Financial Companies Risk .\nFinancial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation and\nintervention, which may adversely affect their\nprofitability, the scope of their activities,\nthe prices they can charge, the amount of\ncapital and liquid assets they must maintain\nand their size, among other things. Financial\nservices companies also may be significantly\naffected by, among other things, interest\nrates, economic conditions, volatility in\nfinancial markets, credit rating downgrades,\nadverse public perception, exposure\nconcentration and counterparty risk.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese S-20 factors, among others, may lead to\nthe Fund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary\nmarket at a premium or discount to NAV or to\nthe intraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Operational Risk . The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited\nto, human error, processing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders, counterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk . The Fund invests in\ncountries or regions whose economies are\nheavily dependent upon trading with key\npartners. Any reduction in this trading may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund's\ninvestments. Through its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers, the Fund is\nspecifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk,\nEuropean Economic Risk and U.S. Economic Risk.\nRisk of Investing in Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s investment in developed country issuers\nwill subject the Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries tend to\nrepresent a significant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed countries have\nexperienced security concerns, such as war,\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a country\u2019s or\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities. Risk of\nInvesting in Japan . Investing in Japanese\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, currency,\ngeographic and security risks that are\nspecific to Japan. Japan\u2019s economy depends\nheavily on international trade, oil and other\ncommodity imports, and government policy\nsupporting its exports. Other risks facing the\nJapanese economy include significant public\ndebt and deficits, currency fluctuations, and\nlabor shortages due to an aging and declining\npopulation. Japan\u2019s relations with its\nneighbors have been strained at times, which\ncould adversely affect its markets and\neconomy. Japan is also vulnerable to natural\ndisasters. Securities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a decline in the\nvalue of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. Tracking Error Risk\n. The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking error,\n\u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-21\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Index\nreturns beginning on June 1, 2022 reflect the\nperformance of the STOXX International Equity\nFactor Index, which, effective as of June 1,\n2022, replaced the MSCI World ex USA\nDiversified Multiple-Factor Index as the\nUnderlying Index of the Fund. After-tax\nreturns in the table above are calculated\nusing the historical highest individual U.S.\nfederal marginal income tax rates and do not\nreflect the impact of state or local taxes.\nActual after-tax returns depend on an\ninvestor\u2019s tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown, and after-tax returns shown are\nnot relevant to tax-exempt investors or\ninvestors who hold shares through tax-deferred\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-22\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2015. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-23\n\niSHARES \u00ae INTERNATIONAL SMALL-CAP EQUITY\nFACTOR ETF Ticker: ISCF Stock Exchange: NYSE\nArca Investment Objective The iShares\nInternational Small-Cap Equity Factor ETF (the\n\u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment\nresults of an index composed of global\ndeveloped market small-capitalization stocks,\nexcluding the U.S., that have favorable\nexposure to target style factors subject to\nconstraints. Fees and Expenses The following\ntable describes the fees and expenses that you\nwill incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of\nthe Fund. The investment advisory agreement\nbetween iShares Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and\nBlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) provides\nthat BFA will pay all operating expenses of\nthe Fund, except: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv)\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.23%     None       0.00%       0.23%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $24         $74     $130      $293  \n                                      \nS-24\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 26% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe STOXX International Small-Cap Equity\nFactor Index (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ),\nwhich is a rules- based equity index provided\nby STOXX Ltd. (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c\nSTOXX \u201d ). The Underlying Index is composed of\nsmall-capitalization equity securities from\nthe STOXX International Developed Markets\nSmall Cap Index (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ) that\nare selected and weighted using an\noptimization process designed to maximize\nexposure to four target factors: momentum,\nquality, value, and low volatility. The\nUnderlying Index seeks to control exposure to,\namong other things, industries and countries,\nlimit turnover and maintain a level of risk\nsimilar to that of the Parent Index. The\nParent Index is a free float market\ncapitalization-weighted index designed to\nmeasure the performance of small-\ncapitalization companies from developed market\ncountries excluding the U.S. Small-\ncapitalization companies represent\napproximately the bottom 15% of the investable\nmarket capitalization of each developed market\ncountry included in the Parent Index, as\ndetermined by STOXX. The momentum score is\ncalculated from the following signals: price\nmomentum, earnings momentum and earnings\nannouncement drift ( i.e. , the difference\nbetween a stock\u2019s performance on and\nimmediately following an earnings announcement\ndate). The quality score is calculated from\nthe following signals: gross profitability,\nshare dilution, accruals, changes in net\noperating assets, carbon emissions intensity\nand greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG \u201d ) reduction\ntargets. Carbon emissions intensity is based\non the issuer\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG\nemissions (i.e. , direct emissions from\nsources that an issuer owns or controls and\nindirect emissions from the issuer\u2019s purchase\nof energy) relative to peers in its Industry\nClassification Benchmark ( \u201c ICB \u201d )\nSupersector, as reported by Institutional\nShareholder Services ( \u201c ISS \u201d ). The GHG\ntargets signal is based on the robustness of\nan issuer\u2019s GHG reduction targets, including\nwhether they are part of the Science Based\nTargets initiative ( \u201c SBTi \u201d ) framework;\nthis is assessed by ISS based on its own ESG\nratings data and SBTi data. The value score is\ncalculated from the following signals: current\nbook value-to-price ratio, dividend yield (\ni.e. , 12-month trailing dividend divided by\ntotal market capitalization), earnings yield (\ni.e. , 12-month net income divided by total\nmarket capitalization), cash flow yield ( i.e.\n, 12-month cash flow divided by total market\ncapitalization) and time series normalized\ncash flow yield over the previous 36 months.\nThe low volatility score is based on prior\n12-month volatility, as calculated by the\nIndex Provider. The maximum weight of a single\nsecurity is 10%, and the sum of security\nweights that are individually greater than\n4.5% must be less than 22.5% of the Underlying\nIndex. The Index Provider also applies other\nconstraints, such as country and sector\nexposures relative to the Parent Index, among\nothers. The Underlying Index is reviewed and\nrebalanced quarterly. As of July 31, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index consisted of approximately\n1,027 constituents from companies in the\nfollowing countries or regions: Australia,\nAustria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland and the United Kingdom (the \u201c U.K.\n\u201d ). As of July 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the consumer\ndiscretionary and industrials industries or\nsectors. The components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over time. BFA uses\nan indexing approach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund does not try to\n\u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. S-25 The\nFund may lend securities representing up to\none-third of the value of the Fund's total\nassets (including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by STOXX, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Securities issued\nby non-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and European Economic Risk. Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk . Compared to\nmid- and large-capitalization companies,\nsmall-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of small-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge- or mid-capitalization stocks. Style\nFactors Risk . Each of the four equity style\nfactors ( i.e ., momentum, quality, value and\nlow volatility) that determine the weight of\neach component security in the Underlying\nIndex has characteristics that may cause the\nFund to underperform the Parent Index or the\nmarket as a whole. Momentum Factor Risk .\nSecurities that previously exhibited greater\nmomentum characteristics may not continue to\nexperience positive momentum, and such a\nchange could occur quickly. Momentum\nsecurities may experience more volatility than\nthe market as a whole. Quality Factor Risk .\nSecurities that previously exhibited greater\nquality characteristics than other securities\nmay not continue to be quality securities.\nMany factors can impact a security\u2019s quality\nand performance, and such factors and their\nimpact may be difficult to predict. Value\nFactor Risk . Value securities are those\nissued by companies that may be perceived as\nundervalued. Such securities may decline in\nprice or fail to appreciate for long periods\nof time, and they may never realize their full\npotential value. Low Volatility Factor Risk .\nLow volatility securities may underperform the\nbroader market during periods of strong,\nrising or speculative stock prices. The prices\nof such securities may not be any less\nvolatile (and could be more volatile) than the\nmarket as a whole. Equity Securities Risk .\nEquity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue, and their values may be more volatile\nthan those of other asset classes. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of\nreasons that may directly relate to the issuer\nas well as due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. S-26 Asset Class Risk. The\nsecurities and other assets in the Underlying\nIndex or in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may\nunderperform in comparison to financial\nmarkets generally, a particular financial\nmarket, another index, or other asset classes.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk. An\n\u201c Authorized Participant \u201d is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof creation units ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only\nan Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Consumer goods and\nservices companies ( \u201c consumer companies \u201d )\nface risks related to changes in consumer\npreferences and disposable income, commodity\nprices, government regulation, supply chain\ndisruptions, damage to brand or reputation,\neconomic slowdown and labor shortages, among\nother things. Currency Risk . Because the\nFund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the\nNAV could decline if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. ESG Risk. To the\nextent that the Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. The Underlying Index\u2019s use\nof ESG criteria may result in the Fund\ninvesting in, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Industrial Companies Risk.\nIndustrial companies face a number of risks,\nincluding supply chain and distribution\ndisruptions, business interruptions, product\nobsolescence, third-party vendor risks, cyber\nattacks, trade disputes, product recalls,\nliability claims, scarcity of materials or\nparts, excess capacity, changes in consumer\npreferences, and volatility in commodity\nprices and currencies. The performance of such\ncompanies may also be affected by\ntechnological developments, labor relations,\nlegislative and regulatory changes, government\nspending policies, and changes in domestic and\ninternational economies. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. National Closed Market Trading Risk.\nTo the extent that securities or other assets\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or\nin foreign markets that may be closed when the\nS-27 securities exchange on which the Fund\u2019s\nshares trade is open, there are likely to be\ndeviations between such asset\u2019s current price\nand its last quoted price ( i.e ., the quote\nfrom the closed foreign market to the Fund).\nThe impact of a closed foreign market on the\nFund is likely to be greater where a large\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a foreign market\nis closed for unscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that may be\ngreater than those experienced by other funds.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Reliance on Trading\nPartners Risk . The Fund invests in countries\nor regions whose economies are heavily\ndependent upon trading with key partners. Any\nreduction in this trading may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund's investments. Through its\nholdings of securities of certain issuers, the\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and European Economic Risk . Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries . The Fund\u2019s\ninvestment in developed country issuers will\nsubject the Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries tend to\nrepresent a significant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed countries have\nexperienced security concerns, such as war,\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a country\u2019s or\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities. Risk of\nInvesting in Japan . Investing in Japanese\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, currency,\ngeographic and security risks that are\nspecific to Japan. Japan\u2019s economy depends\nheavily on international trade, oil and other\ncommodity imports, and government policy\nsupporting its exports. Other risks facing the\nJapanese economy include significant public\ndebt and deficits, currency fluctuations, and\nlabor shortages due to an aging and declining\npopulation. Japan\u2019s relations with its\nneighbors have been strained at times, which\ncould adversely affect its markets and\neconomy. Japan is also vulnerable to natural\ndisasters. Securities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a decline in the\nvalue of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. Tracking Error Risk\n. The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking error,\n\u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-28\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

Index returns beginning on March 1,\n2023 reflect the performance of the STOXX\nInternational Small-Cap Equity Factor Index,\nwhich, effective as of March 1, 2023, replaced\nthe MSCI World ex USA Small Cap Diversified\nMultiple-Factor Index as the Underlying Index\nof the Fund. After-tax returns in the table\nabove are calculated using the historical\nhighest individual U.S. federal marginal\nincome tax rates and do not reflect the impact\nof state or local taxes. Actual after-tax\nreturns depend on an investor\u2019s tax situation\nand may differ from those shown, and after-tax\nreturns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt\ninvestors or investors who hold shares through\ntax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k)\nplans or individual retirement accounts ( \u201c\nIRAs \u201d ). Fund returns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund shares are\ncalculated assuming that an investor has\nsufficient capital gains of the same character\nfrom other investments to offset any capital\nlosses from the sales of Fund shares. As a\nresult, Fund returns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund shares may\nexceed Fund returns before taxes and/or\nreturns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-29\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2015. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-30\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI EAFE GROWTH ETF Ticker: EFG\nStock Exchange: Cboe BZX Investment Objective\nThe iShares MSCI EAFE Growth ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d\n) seeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of developed market equities,\nexcluding the U.S. and Canada, that exhibit\ngrowth characteristics. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026             Total       \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExp\u2026  AnnualFun\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.35%     None       0.01%      0.36%       \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. Example. This\nExample is intended to help you compare the\ncost of owning shares of the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of those\nperiods. The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses remain the same.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $37        $116     $202      $456  \n                                      \nS-31\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 22% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI EAFE Growth Index (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ), which is a subset of the MSCI EAFE\nIndex. The MSCI EAFE Index has been developed\nby MSCI Inc. (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c MSCI\n\u201d ) to measure the equity market performance\nof developed markets outside of the U.S. and\nCanada. Constituents of the Underlying Index\ninclude securities of companies located in\nEurope, Australasia and the Far East. The\nUnderlying Index generally represents\napproximately 50% of the free float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization of the MSCI EAFE Index\nand consists of those securities classified by\nMSCI as most representing the growth style.\nMSCI uses five variables to identify growth\nstyle securities: long-term forward earnings\nper share ( \u201c EPS \u201d ) growth rate, short-term\nforward EPS growth rate, current internal\ngrowth rate, long-term historical EPS growth\ntrend and long-term historical sales per share\ngrowth trend. MSCI uses a specialized\nframework to attribute both value and growth\nstyle characteristics to each security within\nthe MSCI EAFE Index. Each security is\nevaluated based on certain value factors and\ngrowth factors, which are then used to\ncalculate a value score and a growth score.\nBased upon these two scores, MSCI determines\nthe extent to which each security is assigned\nto the value or growth style. It is possible\nfor a single security to have representation\nin both the value and growth style indexes;\nhowever, no more than 100% of a security\u2019s\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization will be\nincluded within the combined style framework.\nThe Underlying Index includes large- and mid-\ncapitalization companies and may change over\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, the Underlying\nIndex consisted of securities from the\nfollowing countries or regions: Australia,\nAustria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\nJapan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPortugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland and the United Kingdom (the \u201c U.K.\n\u201d ). As of July 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the consumer\ndiscretionary, healthcare, industrials and\ntechnology industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby MSCI, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. S-32\nRisk of Investing in Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s investment in developed country issuers\nwill subject the Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries tend to\nrepresent a significant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed countries have\nexperienced security concerns, such as war,\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a country\u2019s or\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities. Growth\nSecurities Risk . Growth securities are those\nissued by companies whose earnings growth\npotential appears to be greater than the\nmarket in general and whose revenue growth is\nexpected to continue for an extended period of\ntime. The prices of growth securities may be\nmore volatile than those of other types of\ninvestments and can decline rapidly and\nsignificantly in reaction to negative news.\nGrowth securities may underperform value\nsecurities and other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market. Growth securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of the Fund.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Consumer goods and\nservices companies ( \u201c consumer companies \u201d )\nface risks related to changes in consumer\npreferences and disposable income, commodity\nprices, government regulation, supply chain\ndisruptions, damage to brand or reputation,\neconomic slowdown and labor shortages, among\nother things. Currency Risk . Because the\nFund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the\nNAV could decline if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. S-33 Healthcare\nCompanies Risk . The profitability of\nhealthcare companies may be adversely affected\nby extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, the\nprotection and expiration of patents, limited\nproduct lines, supply chain issues, labor\nshortages and product liability claims, among\nother factors. Industrial Companies Risk.\nIndustrial companies face a number of risks,\nincluding supply chain and distribution\ndisruptions, business interruptions, product\nobsolescence, third-party vendor risks, cyber\nattacks, trade disputes, product recalls,\nliability claims, scarcity of materials or\nparts, excess capacity, changes in consumer\npreferences, and volatility in commodity\nprices and currencies. The performance of such\ncompanies may also be affected by\ntechnological developments, labor relations,\nlegislative and regulatory changes, government\nspending policies, and changes in domestic and\ninternational economies. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. National Closed Market Trading Risk.\nTo the extent that securities or other assets\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or\nin foreign markets that may be closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrade is open, there are likely to be\ndeviations between such asset\u2019s current price\nand its last quoted price ( i.e ., the quote\nfrom the closed foreign market to the Fund).\nThe impact of a closed foreign market on the\nFund is likely to be greater where a large\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a foreign market\nis closed for unscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that may be\ngreater than those experienced by other funds.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Securities issued\nby non-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and European Economic Risk . Operational\nRisk . The Fund is exposed to operational\nrisks arising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u2019s service providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through controls and\nprocedures. However, these measures do not\naddress every possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant operational\nrisks. Reliance on Trading Partners Risk . The\nFund invests in countries or regions whose\neconomies are heavily dependent upon trading\nwith key partners. Any reduction in this\ntrading may have an adverse impact on the\nFund's investments. Through its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers, the Fund is\nspecifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk ,\nEuropean Economic Risk and U.S. Economic Risk\n. Risk of Investing in Japan . Investing in\nJapanese issuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, currency,\ngeographic and security risks that are\nspecific to Japan. Japan\u2019s economy depends\nheavily on international trade, oil and other\ncommodity imports, and government policy\nsupporting its exports. Other risks facing the\nJapanese economy include significant public\ndebt and deficits, currency fluctuations, and\nlabor shortages due to an aging and declining\npopulation. Japan\u2019s relations with its\nneighbors have been strained at times, which\ncould adversely affect its markets and\neconomy. Japan is also vulnerable to natural\ndisasters. Securities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a decline in the\nvalue of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. S-34 Technology\nCompanies Risk . Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological\nadvances may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, supply chains\nand personnel. These companies typically face\nintense competition, potentially rapid product\nobsolescence and changes in product cycles and\ncustomer preferences. They may face unexpected\nrisks and costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-35\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-36\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares\nof the Fund may only be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (a premium) or less\nthan NAV (a discount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the difference between\nthe highest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when buying or\nselling shares in the secondary market (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax Information The Fund\nintends to make distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\ndeferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or\nan IRA, in which case, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when withdrawn.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-37\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI EAFE MIN\nVOL FACTOR ETF Ticker: EFAV Stock Exchange:\nCboe BZX Investment Objective The iShares MSCI\nEAFE Min Vol Factor ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks\nto track the investment results of an index\ncomposed of developed market equities that, in\nthe aggregate, have lower volatility\ncharacteristics relative to the broader\ndeveloped equity markets, excluding the U.S.\nand Canada. Fees and Expenses The following\ntable describes the fees and expenses that you\nwill incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of\nthe Fund. The investment advisory agreement\nbetween iShares Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and\nBlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) provides\nthat BFA will pay all operating expenses of\nthe Fund, except: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv)\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.20%     None       0.00%       0.20%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $20         $64     $113      $255  \n                                      \nS-38\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 23% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI EAFE Minimum Volatility (USD) Index\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which has been\ndeveloped by MSCI Inc. (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d\nor \u201c MSCI \u201d ) to measure the performance of\ninternational equity securities (excluding the\nU.S. and Canada) that in the aggregate have\nlower volatility relative to the MSCI EAFE\nIndex (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), which is a\ncapitalization-weighted index. In constructing\nthe Underlying Index, MSCI uses a rules-based\nmethodology to select securities from the\nParent Index and to determine their\nweightings. In order to determine weightings\nof securities within the Underlying Index,\nMSCI seeks to optimize the Parent Index such\nthat the resulting portfolio exhibits the\nlowest absolute volatility, as measured by\nMSCI, while applying constraints based on\nturnover, minimum and maximum weightings of\nindex constituents, sectors, and countries as\nwell as factor constraints (for example,\nliquidity and financial leverage) as measured\nby MSCI. The Underlying Index includes stocks\nfrom Europe, Australasia, the Middle East and\nthe Far East and, as of July 31, 2024,\nconsisted of securities from the following 20\ndeveloped market countries or regions:\nAustralia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\nJapan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPortugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland and the United Kingdom (the \u201c U.K.\n\u201d ). The Underlying Index includes large- and\nmid-capitalization companies and may change\nover time. As of July 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the financials,\nindustrials and healthcare industries or\nsectors. The components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over time. BFA uses\nan indexing approach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund does not try to\n\u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by MSCI, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s investment in developed country issuers\nwill subject the Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries tend to\nrepresent a significant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed countries have\nS-39 experienced security concerns, such as\nwar, terrorism and strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a country\u2019s or\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities. Low\nVolatility Risk . A low volatility strategy\nmay underperform the broader market during\nperiods of strong, rising or speculative stock\nprices. In addition, there is a risk that the\nFund may experience more than minimum\nvolatility. Securities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nmay be subject to price volatility, and their\nprices may not be less volatile (and could be\nmore volatile) than the market as a whole,\nwhich could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nHealthcare Companies Risk . The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, the\nprotection and expiration of patents, limited\nS-40 product lines, supply chain issues, labor\nshortages and product liability claims, among\nother factors. Industrial Companies Risk.\nIndustrial companies face a number of risks,\nincluding supply chain and distribution\ndisruptions, business interruptions, product\nobsolescence, third-party vendor risks, cyber\nattacks, trade disputes, product recalls,\nliability claims, scarcity of materials or\nparts, excess capacity, changes in consumer\npreferences, and volatility in commodity\nprices and currencies. The performance of such\ncompanies may also be affected by\ntechnological developments, labor relations,\nlegislative and regulatory changes, government\nspending policies, and changes in domestic and\ninternational economies. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Non-U.S. Securities Risk .\nSecurities issued by non-U.S. issuers\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to\ndifferent legal, regulatory, political,\neconomic, and market risks than securities\nissued by U.S. issuers. These risks include\ngreater market volatility, less market\nliquidity, higher transaction costs,\nexpropriation, confiscatory taxation, adverse\nchanges in foreign investment or currency\ncontrol regulations, restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and European Economic Risk . Operational\nRisk . The Fund is exposed to operational\nrisks arising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u2019s service providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through controls and\nprocedures. However, these measures do not\naddress every possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant operational\nrisks. Reliance on Trading Partners Risk . The\nFund invests in countries or regions whose\neconomies are heavily dependent upon trading\nwith key partners. Any reduction in this\ntrading may have an adverse impact on the\nFund's investments. Through its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers, the Fund is\nspecifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk ,\nEuropean Economic Risk and U.S. Economic Risk\n. Risk of Investing in Japan . Investing in\nJapanese issuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, currency,\ngeographic and security risks that are\nspecific to Japan. Japan\u2019s economy depends\nheavily on international trade, oil and other\ncommodity imports, and government policy\nsupporting its exports. Other risks facing the\nJapanese economy include significant public\ndebt and deficits, currency fluctuations, and\nlabor shortages due to an aging and declining\npopulation. Japan\u2019s relations with its\nneighbors have been strained at times, which\ncould adversely affect its markets and\neconomy. Japan is also vulnerable to natural\ndisasters. Securities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. The Fund could S-41\nalso lose money in the event of a decline in\nthe value of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. Tracking Error Risk\n. The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking error,\n\u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-42\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-43\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares\nof the Fund may only be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (a premium) or less\nthan NAV (a discount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the difference between\nthe highest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when buying or\nselling shares in the secondary market (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax Information The Fund\nintends to make distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\ndeferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or\nan IRA, in which case, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when withdrawn.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-44\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI EAFE SMALL-CAP ETF Ticker: SCZ\nStock Exchange: Nasdaq Investment Objective\nThe iShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap ETF (the \u201c\nFund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment results\nof an index composed of small-capitalization\ndeveloped market equities, excluding the U.S.\nand Canada. Fees and Expenses The following\ntable describes the fees and expenses that you\nwill incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of\nthe Fund. The investment advisory agreement\nbetween iShares Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and\nBlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) provides\nthat BFA will pay all operating expenses of\nthe Fund, except: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv)\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.40%     None       0.00%       0.40%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $41        $128     $224      $505  \n                                      \nS-45\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 14% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which represents the\nsmall-capitalization segment of the MSCI EAFE\nIMI Index. The MSCI EAFE IMI Index is an\nequity index developed by MSCI Inc. (the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ) that captures\nlarge-, mid- and small-capitalization\nrepresentation across developed markets\noutside of the U.S. and Canada. Constituents\nof the Underlying Index include securities\nfrom Europe, Australasia and the Far East.\nUnder MSCI\u2019s Global Investable Market Index\n(IMI) methodology, the small-capitalization\nuniverse consists of securities of those\ncompanies not included in the large-\ncapitalization or mid-capitalization segments\nof a particular market, which together\ncomprise approximately 85% of each market\u2019s\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization. The\nsmall-cap segment covers the 85%-99% range of\neach market\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. As of July 31, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index consisted of securities from\nthe following 21 developed market countries or\nregions: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark,\nFinland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland,\nIsrael, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New\nZealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain,\nSweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom\n(the \u201c U.K. \u201d ). As of July 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nindustrials industry or sector. The components\nof the Underlying Index are likely to change\nover time. BFA uses an indexing approach to\ntry to achieve the Fund\u2019s investment\nobjective. Unlike many investment companies,\nthe Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it\ntracks and does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby MSCI, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s investment in developed country issuers\nwill subject the Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries tend to\nrepresent a significant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed countries have\nexperienced security concerns, such as war,\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a country\u2019s or\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities. Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk . Compared to\nmid- and large-capitalization companies,\nsmall-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of small-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may S-46 be more volatile\nthan that of a fund with a greater investment\nin large- or mid-capitalization stocks. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Industrial\nCompanies Risk. Industrial companies face a\nnumber of risks, including supply chain and\ndistribution disruptions, business\ninterruptions, product obsolescence, third-\nparty vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. S-47 National Closed Market Trading\nRisk. To the extent that securities or other\nassets held by the Fund trade on foreign\nexchanges or in foreign markets that may be\nclosed when the securities exchange on which\nthe Fund\u2019s shares trade is open, there are\nlikely to be deviations between such asset\u2019s\ncurrent price and its last quoted price ( i.e\n., the quote from the closed foreign market to\nthe Fund). The impact of a closed foreign\nmarket on the Fund is likely to be greater\nwhere a large portion of the Fund\u2019s holdings\ntrade on a closed foreign market or when a\nforeign market is closed for unscheduled\nreasons. These deviations could result in\npremiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that\nmay be greater than those experienced by other\nfunds. Non-U.S. Securities Risk . Securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers (including\ndepositary receipts) are subject to different\nlegal, regulatory, political, economic, and\nmarket risks than securities issued by U.S.\nissuers. These risks include greater market\nvolatility, less market liquidity, higher\ntransaction costs, expropriation, confiscatory\ntaxation, adverse changes in foreign\ninvestment or currency control regulations,\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital,\nand political instability. Non-U.S. issuers\nmay be subject to different accounting, audit\nand financial reporting standards than U.S.\nissuers, and there may be less publicly\navailable information about non-U.S. issuers.\nForeign market trading hours, different\nclearing and settlement procedures, and\nholiday schedules may limit the Fund's ability\nto engage in portfolio transactions. To the\nextent that investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. The Fund is specifically exposed to\nAsian Economic Risk and European Economic Risk\n. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Reliance on Trading\nPartners Risk . The Fund invests in countries\nor regions whose economies are heavily\ndependent upon trading with key partners. Any\nreduction in this trading may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund's investments. Through its\nholdings of securities of certain issuers, the\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk, European Economic Risk and U.S. Economic\nRisk . Risk of Investing in Japan . Investing\nin Japanese issuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, economic,\ncurrency, geographic and security risks that\nare specific to Japan. Japan\u2019s economy depends\nheavily on international trade, oil and other\ncommodity imports, and government policy\nsupporting its exports. Other risks facing the\nJapanese economy include significant public\ndebt and deficits, currency fluctuations, and\nlabor shortages due to an aging and declining\npopulation. Japan\u2019s relations with its\nneighbors have been strained at times, which\ncould adversely affect its markets and\neconomy. Japan is also vulnerable to natural\ndisasters. Securities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a decline in the\nvalue of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. Tracking Error Risk\n. The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking error,\n\u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers.

The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-49\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares\nof the Fund may only be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (a premium) or less\nthan NAV (a discount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the difference between\nthe highest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when buying or\nselling shares in the secondary market (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax Information The Fund\nintends to make distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\ndeferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or\nan IRA, in which case, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when withdrawn.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-50\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI EAFE VALUE ETF Ticker: EFV\nStock Exchange: Cboe BZX Investment Objective\nThe iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d\n) seeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of developed market equities,\nexcluding the U.S. and Canada, that exhibit\nvalue characteristics.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $34        $106     $185      $418  \n                                      \nS-51\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 28% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI EAFE Value Index (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ), which is a subset of the MSCI EAFE\nIndex. The MSCI EAFE Index has been developed\nby MSCI Inc. (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c MSCI\n\u201d ) to measure the equity market performance\nof developed markets outside of the U.S. and\nCanada. Constituents of the Underlying Index\ninclude securities from Europe, Australasia\nand the Far East. The Underlying Index targets\napproximately 50% coverage of the free float-\nadjusted market capitalization of the MSCI\nEAFE Index and consists of those securities\nclassified by MSCI as most representing the\nvalue style of investing. Securities\nclassified in this style generally tend to\nhave higher value characteristics ( i.e. ,\nhigher book value to price, 12-month forward\nearnings to price and dividend yield). MSCI\nuses a specialized framework to attribute both\nvalue and growth style characteristics to each\nsecurity within the MSCI EAFE Index. Each\nsecurity is evaluated based on certain value\nfactors and growth factors, which are then\nused to calculate a value score and growth\nscore. Based upon these two scores, MSCI\ndetermines the extent to which each security\nis assigned to the value or growth style. It\nis possible for a single security to have\nrepresentation in both the value and growth\nstyle indexes; however, no more than 100% of a\nsecurity\u2019s float-adjusted market\ncapitalization will be included within the\ncombined style framework. The Underlying Index\nincludes large- and mid-capitalization\ncompanies and may change over time. As of July\n31, 2024, the Underlying Index consisted of\nsecurities from the following countries or\nregions: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark,\nFinland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland,\nIsrael, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New\nZealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain,\nSweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom\n(the \u201c U.K. \u201d ). As of July 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nfinancials industry or sector. The components\nof the Underlying Index are likely to change\nover time. BFA uses an indexing approach to\ntry to achieve the Fund\u2019s investment\nobjective. Unlike many investment companies,\nthe Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it\ntracks and does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby MSCI, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s investment in developed country issuers\nwill subject the Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries tend to\nrepresent a significant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed countries have\nexperienced security concerns, such as war,\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a country\u2019s or\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby S-52 changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities. Value\nSecurities Risk . Value securities are those\nissued by companies that may be perceived as\nundervalued. Such securities may decline in\nprice or fail to appreciate for long periods\nof time, and they may never realize their full\npotential value. Value securities may\nunderperform growth securities and other types\nof assets as well as the overall stock market.\nValue securities may go in and out of favor\nover time, which could affect the performance\nof the Fund. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIssuer Risk . The performance of the Fund\ndepends on the performance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to which the Fund\nhas exposure. The value of securities or other\nassets may decline, or perform differently\nfrom the market as a whole, due to changes in\nthe financial condition or credit rating of\nthe issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. S-53 There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Non-U.S. Securities Risk .\nSecurities issued by non-U.S. issuers\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to\ndifferent legal, regulatory, political,\neconomic, and market risks than securities\nissued by U.S. issuers. These risks include\ngreater market volatility, less market\nliquidity, higher transaction costs,\nexpropriation, confiscatory taxation, adverse\nchanges in foreign investment or currency\ncontrol regulations, restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and European Economic Risk . Operational\nRisk . The Fund is exposed to operational\nrisks arising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u2019s service providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through controls and\nprocedures. However, these measures do not\naddress every possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant operational\nrisks. Reliance on Trading Partners Risk . The\nFund invests in countries or regions whose\neconomies are heavily dependent upon trading\nwith key partners. Any reduction in this\ntrading may have an adverse impact on the\nFund's investments. Through its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers, the Fund is\nspecifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk,\nEuropean Economic Risk and U.S. Economic Risk\n. Risk of Investing in Japan . Investing in\nJapanese issuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, currency,\ngeographic and security risks that are\nspecific to Japan. Japan\u2019s economy depends\nheavily on international trade, oil and other\ncommodity imports, and government policy\nsupporting its exports. Other risks facing the\nJapanese economy include significant public\ndebt and deficits, currency fluctuations, and\nlabor shortages due to an aging and declining\npopulation. Japan\u2019s relations with its\nneighbors have been strained at times, which\ncould adversely affect its markets and\neconomy. Japan is also vulnerable to natural\ndisasters. Securities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a decline in the\nvalue of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. Tracking Error Risk\n. The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking error,\n\u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change S-54\n\non days or during time periods when investors\nare not able to purchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that create or redeem\nFund shares on days when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or lower or\nhigher redemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\nassets not been fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology. The ability to\nvalue investments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders.\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-55\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares\nof the Fund may only be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (a premium) or less\nthan NAV (a discount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the difference between\nthe highest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when buying or\nselling shares in the secondary market (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax Information The Fund\nintends to make distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\ndeferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or\nan IRA, in which case, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when withdrawn.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-56\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI EUROPE SMALL-CAP ETF Ticker:\nIEUS Stock Exchange: Nasdaq Investment\nObjective The iShares MSCI Europe Small-Cap\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the\ninvestment results of an index composed of\nsmall-capitalization developed market equities\nin Europe.

The investment advisory agreement\nbetween iShares Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and\nBlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) provides\nthat BFA will pay all operating expenses of\nthe Fund, except: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv)\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026             Total       \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExp\u2026  AnnualFun\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.40%     None       0.01%      0.41%       \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. Example. This\nExample is intended to help you compare the\ncost of owning shares of the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of those\nperiods. The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses remain the same.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $42        $132     $230      $518  \n                                      \nS-57\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 16% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI Europe Small Cap Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which is a free float-\nadjusted, market capitalization-weighted index\nthat captures small-capitalization\nrepresentation across the 15 developed market\ncountries in Europe, as defined by MSCI Inc.\n(the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index covers approximately 14% of\nthe free float-adjusted market capitalization\nin the European equity markets. As of July 31,\n2024, the Underlying Index consisted of\nsecurities from the following countries or\nregions: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the\nNetherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland and the United Kingdom (the \u201c U.K.\n\u201d ). As of July 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the financials\nand industrials industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby MSCI, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in Europe . The Fund is more\nexposed to the economic and political risks of\nEurope and of the European countries in which\nit invests than funds whose investments are\nmore geographically diversified. Adverse\neconomic and political events, including war,\nin Europe may cause the Fund\u2019s investments to\ndecline in value. The economies and markets of\nEuropean countries are often closely connected\nand interdependent, and events in one country\nin Europe can have an adverse impact on other\nEuropean countries. The Fund makes investments\nin securities of issuers that are domiciled\nin, or have significant operations in, member\nstates of the European Union (the \u201c EU \u201d )\nthat are subject to economic and monetary\ncontrols that can adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. The European financial markets\nhave historically experienced volatility and\nadverse trends and these events have and may\nin the future adversely affect the exchange\nrate of the euro and may significantly affect\nother European countries. Small-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk . Compared to mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies, small-capitalization\ncompanies may be less stable and more\nsusceptible to adverse developments. The\nsecurities of small-capitalization companies\nS-58 may be more volatile and less liquid than\nthose of mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies. As a result, the Fund\u2019s share price\nmay be more volatile than that of a fund with\na greater investment in large- or mid-\ncapitalization stocks. Equity Securities Risk\n. Equity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue, and their values may be more volatile\nthan those of other asset classes. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of\nreasons that may directly relate to the issuer\nas well as due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. S-59 Management Risk .\nThe Fund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. National Closed Market Trading Risk.\nTo the extent that securities or other assets\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or\nin foreign markets that may be closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrade is open, there are likely to be\ndeviations between such asset\u2019s current price\nand its last quoted price ( i.e ., the quote\nfrom the closed foreign market to the Fund).\nThe impact of a closed foreign market on the\nFund is likely to be greater where a large\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a foreign market\nis closed for unscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that may be\ngreater than those experienced by other funds.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Securities issued\nby non-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to European\nEconomic Risk . Operational Risk . The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited\nto, human error, processing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders, counterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk . The Fund invests in\ncountries or regions whose economies are\nheavily dependent upon trading with key\npartners. Any reduction in this trading may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund's\ninvestments. Through its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers, the Fund is\nspecifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk,\nEuropean Economic Risk and U.S. Economic Risk\n. Risk of Investing in Developed Countries .\nThe Fund\u2019s investment in developed country\nissuers will subject the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security,\neconomic and other risks associated with\ndeveloped countries. Developed countries tend\nto represent a significant portion of the\nglobal economy and have generally experienced\nslower economic growth than some less\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries have experienced security concerns,\nsuch as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nIn addition, developed countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to the economic\nconditions of certain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price\nor availability of certain commodities. Risk\nof Investing in the U.K. Investing in U.K.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, currency,\ngeographic and security risks that are\nspecific to the U.K. Economic downturns or\npolitical instability in its key trading\npartners, which include the United States and\nother European countries, could have an\nadverse effect on the U.K. economy. Following\nBrexit, certain trading matters between the\nU.K. and the European Union (the \u201c EU \u201d )\nremain unresolved, including with respect to\nfinancial services. The continuing uncertainty\ncould have an adverse impact on the U.K.\neconomy and currency. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with S-60\ncertain regulatory requirements or limits.\nTracking error risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. A Fund that tracks\nan index with exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-61\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Index returns\nbeginning on September 1, 2014 reflect the\nperformance of the MSCI Europe Small Cap\nIndex, which, effective as of September 1,\n2014, replaced the FTSE Developed Small Cap\nex-North America Index as the Underlying Index\nof the Fund. After-tax returns in the table\nabove are calculated using the historical\nhighest individual U.S. federal marginal\nincome tax rates and do not reflect the impact\nof state or local taxes. Actual after-tax\nreturns depend on an investor\u2019s tax situation\nand may differ from those shown, and after-tax\nreturns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt\ninvestors or investors who hold shares through\ntax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k)\nplans or individual retirement accounts ( \u201c\nIRAs \u201d ). Fund returns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund shares are\ncalculated assuming that an investor has\nsufficient capital gains of the same character\nfrom other investments to offset any capital\nlosses from the sales of Fund shares. As a\nresult, Fund returns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund shares may\nexceed Fund returns before taxes and/or\nreturns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-62\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares\nof the Fund may only be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (a premium) or less\nthan NAV (a discount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the difference between\nthe highest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when buying or\nselling shares in the secondary market (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax Information The Fund\nintends to make distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\ndeferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or\nan IRA, in which case, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when withdrawn.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-63\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI INTL MOMENTUM\nFACTOR ETF Ticker: IMTM Stock Exchange: NYSE\nArca Investment Objective The iShares MSCI\nIntl Momentum Factor ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks\nto track the investment results of an index\nthat measures the performance of international\ndeveloped large- and mid-capitalization stocks\nexhibiting relatively higher momentum\ncharacteristics. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.30%     None       0.00%       0.30%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $31         $97     $169      $381  \n                                      \nS-64\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 70% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI World ex USA Momentum Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which consists of stocks\nexhibiting relatively higher momentum\ncharacteristics than the traditional market\ncapitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI\nWorld ex USA Index (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), as\ndetermined by MSCI Inc. (the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ). The Parent Index includes\nequity securities in approximately the top 85%\nof equity market capitalization in developed\nmarket countries, as defined by the Index\nProvider, excluding the U.S. The Underlying\nIndex is designed to reflect the performance\nof an equity momentum strategy that emphasizes\nstocks with high price momentum, while\nmaintaining reasonably high trading liquidity,\ninvestment capacity and moderate index\nturnover. A risk-adjusted price momentum\nscore, defined by MSCI as the excess return\nover the risk-free rate divided by the\nannualized standard deviation of weekly\nreturns over the past three years, is\ncalculated for each security in the Parent\nIndex over 6- and 12-month time periods. The\n6- and 12-month risk-adjusted price momentum\ncalculations are then standardized at +/- 3\nstandard deviations and translated into an\naverage momentum score. The weight of each\nUnderlying Index constituent is determined by\nmultiplying the security\u2019s momentum score by\nits market capitalization weight in the Parent\nIndex. Additionally, each individual issuer is\ncapped at 5% at reconstitution. MSCI uses an\nalgorithm to determine the number of\ncomponents in the Underlying Index based on\nthe number of constituents in the Parent\nIndex. The Underlying Index is reconstituted\nsemi-annually. After the constituent changes\nare determined at each semi-annual\nreconstitution, the Index Provider distributes\nthose changes over three days (generally, the\nreconstitution effective date and the two\nprior business days) to reconstitute the\nUnderlying Index. As of July 31, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index consisted of securities from\n300 companies in the following 21 countries or\nregions: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada,\nDenmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong,\nIreland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New\nZealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain,\nSweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom\n(the \u201c U.K. \u201d ). The Underlying Index includes\nlarge- and mid-capitalization companies and\nmay change over time. As of July 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nfinancials and industrials industries or\nsectors. The components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over time. BFA uses\nan indexing approach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund does not try to\n\u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by MSCI, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\nS-65 trading price, yield, total return and\nability to meet its investment objective.\nCertain key risks are prioritized below (with\nothers following in alphabetical order), but\nthe relative significance of any risk is\ndifficult to predict and may change over time.\nYou should review each risk factor carefully.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Securities issued\nby non-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and European Economic Risk . Momentum\nSecurities Risk . Securities that previously\nexhibited greater momentum characteristics\nthan other securities may not continue to\nexperience positive momentum, and such a\nchange could occur quickly. Momentum\nsecurities may experience more volatility than\nthe market as a whole, and their returns may\nbe less than the returns of other styles of\ninvesting or the overall stock market. The\nFund may experience significant losses if\nmomentum stops, reverses or otherwise behaves\ndifferently than predicted. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer as well as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. S-66 Financial\nCompanies Risk . Financial services companies\nare subject to extensive governmental\nregulation and intervention, which may\nadversely affect their profitability, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and liquid\nassets they must maintain and their size,\namong other things. Financial services\ncompanies also may be significantly affected\nby, among other things, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, volatility in financial\nmarkets, credit rating downgrades, adverse\npublic perception, exposure concentration and\ncounterparty risk. Industrial Companies Risk.\nIndustrial companies face a number of risks,\nincluding supply chain and distribution\ndisruptions, business interruptions, product\nobsolescence, third-party vendor risks, cyber\nattacks, trade disputes, product recalls,\nliability claims, scarcity of materials or\nparts, excess capacity, changes in consumer\npreferences, and volatility in commodity\nprices and currencies. The performance of such\ncompanies may also be affected by\ntechnological developments, labor relations,\nlegislative and regulatory changes, government\nspending policies, and changes in domestic and\ninternational economies. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. National Closed Market Trading Risk.\nTo the extent that securities or other assets\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or\nin foreign markets that may be closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrade is open, there are likely to be\ndeviations between such asset\u2019s current price\nand its last quoted price ( i.e ., the quote\nfrom the closed foreign market to the Fund).\nThe impact of a closed foreign market on the\nFund is likely to be greater where a large\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a foreign market\nis closed for unscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that may be\ngreater than those experienced by other funds.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Reliance on Trading\nPartners Risk . The Fund invests in countries\nor regions whose economies are heavily\ndependent upon trading with key partners. Any\nreduction in this trading may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund's investments. Through its\nholdings of securities of certain issuers, the\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk, European Economic Risk and U.S. Economic\nRisk . Risk of Investing in Developed\nCountries . The Fund\u2019s investment in developed\ncountry issuers will subject the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, economic and other risks associated\nwith developed countries. Developed countries\ntend to represent a significant portion of the\nglobal economy and have generally experienced\nslower economic growth than some less\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries have experienced security concerns,\nsuch as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nIn addition, developed countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to the economic\nconditions of certain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price\nor availability of certain commodities. Risk\nof Investing in Japan . Investing in Japanese\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, currency,\ngeographic and security risks that are\nspecific to Japan. Japan\u2019s economy depends\nheavily on international trade, oil and other\ncommodity imports, and government policy\nsupporting its exports. Other risks facing the\nJapanese economy include significant public\ndebt and deficits, currency fluctuations, and\nlabor shortages due to an aging and declining\npopulation. Japan\u2019s relations with its\nneighbors have been strained at times, which\ncould adversely affect its markets and\neconomy. Japan is also vulnerable to natural\ndisasters. Securities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a decline in the\nvalue of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the value of any\nS-67 investments made with cash collateral.\nThese events could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. Tracking Error Risk\n. The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking error,\n\u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers.

The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-69\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2015. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-70\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI INTL QUALITY FACTOR ETF Ticker:\nIQLT Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment\nObjective The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the\ninvestment results of an index that measures\nthe performance of international developed\nlarge- and mid-capitalization stocks\nexhibiting relatively higher quality\ncharacteristics as identified through three\nfundamental variables: return on equity,\nearnings variability and debt-to-equity. Fees\nand Expenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the tables and examples\nbelow.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.30%     None       0.00%       0.30%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $31         $97     $169      $381  \n                                      \nS-71\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 27% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI World ex USA Sector Neutral Quality\nIndex (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which is\nbased on a traditional market capitalization-\nweighted parent index, the MSCI World ex USA\nIndex (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ). The Parent\nIndex includes equity securities in\napproximately the top 85% of equity market\ncapitalization in developed market countries,\nas defined by MSCI Inc. (the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ), excluding the U.S. The\nUnderlying Index seeks to measure the\nperformance of securities in the Parent Index\nthat exhibit higher quality characteristics\nrelative to their peers within the\ncorresponding Global Industry Classification\nStandard (GICS \u00ae ) sector. To construct the\nUnderlying Index, the Index Provider\ndetermines the \u201c quality score \u201d of each\nsecurity in the Parent Index based on three\nfundamental variables: high return on equity,\nstable year-over-year earnings growth and low\nfinancial leverage. The Underlying Index is\nweighted based on a component's quality score\nmultiplied by its weight in the Parent Index.\nWeights in the Underlying Index are next\nnormalized so that sectors in the Underlying\nIndex represent approximately the same weight\nas in the Parent Index. Additionally, each\nindividual issuer is capped at 5%. The\nUnderlying Index is rebalanced semi-annually.\nAs of July 31, 2024, the Underlying Index\nconsisted of securities from 299 companies in\nthe following 22 countries or regions:\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,\nFinland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland,\nIsrael, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New\nZealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain,\nSweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom\n(the \u201c U.K. \u201d ). The Underlying Index includes\nlarge- and mid-capitalization companies and\nmay change over time. As of July 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nfinancials and industrials industries or\nsectors. The components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over time. BFA uses\nan indexing approach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund does not try to\n\u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by MSCI, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Securities issued\nby non-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those S-72 countries will\nhave a more significant impact on the Fund.\nThe Fund is specifically exposed to European\nEconomic Risk . Quality Securities Risk .\nSecurities that previously exhibited greater\nquality characteristics than other securities\nmay not continue to be quality securities.\nMany factors can impact a security\u2019s quality\nand performance, and such factors and their\nimpact may be difficult to predict. The\nreturns of quality securities may be less than\nthe returns of other styles of investing or\nthe overall stock market. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer as well as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\nS-73 compared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. National Closed Market Trading Risk.\nTo the extent that securities or other assets\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or\nin foreign markets that may be closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrade is open, there are likely to be\ndeviations between such asset\u2019s current price\nand its last quoted price ( i.e ., the quote\nfrom the closed foreign market to the Fund).\nThe impact of a closed foreign market on the\nFund is likely to be greater where a large\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a foreign market\nis closed for unscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that may be\ngreater than those experienced by other funds.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Reliance on Trading\nPartners Risk . The Fund invests in countries\nor regions whose economies are heavily\ndependent upon trading with key partners. Any\nreduction in this trading may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund's investments. Through its\nholdings of securities of certain issuers, the\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk , European Economic Risk and U.S.\nEconomic Risk . Risk of Investing in Developed\nCountries . The Fund\u2019s investment in developed\ncountry issuers will subject the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, economic and other risks associated\nwith developed countries. Developed countries\ntend to represent a significant portion of the\nglobal economy and have generally experienced\nslower economic growth than some less\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries have experienced security concerns,\nsuch as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nIn addition, developed countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to the economic\nconditions of certain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price\nor availability of certain commodities.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may engage\nin securities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-74\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2015. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-76\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI INTL\nVALUE FACTOR ETF Ticker: IVLU Stock Exchange:\nNYSE Arca Investment Objective The iShares\nMSCI Intl Value Factor ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d )\nseeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of international developed\nlarge- and mid-capitalization stocks with\nvalue characteristics and relatively lower\nvaluations. Fees and Expenses The following\ntable describes the fees and expenses that you\nwill incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of\nthe Fund. The investment advisory agreement\nbetween iShares Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and\nBlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) provides\nthat BFA will pay all operating expenses of\nthe Fund, except: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv)\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.30%     None       0.00%       0.30%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $31         $97     $169      $381  \n                                      \nS-77\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 16% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI World ex USA Enhanced Value Index\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which is based on\na traditional market capitalization-weighted\nparent index, the MSCI World ex USA Index (the\n\u201c Parent Index \u201d ). The Parent Index includes\nequity securities in approximately the top 85%\nof equity market capitalization in developed\nmarket countries, as defined by MSCI Inc. (the\n\u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ), excluding\nthe U.S. The Underlying Index is designed to\nrepresent the performance of securities that\nexhibit higher value style characteristics\nrelative to their peers within the\ncorresponding Global Industry Classification\nStandard (GICS \u00ae ) sector. The value style\ncharacteristics for index construction are\ndefined by the Index Provider using three\naccounting variables based on publicly\nreported financial data: price-to-book value,\nprice-to-forward earnings and enterprise\nvalue-to-cash flow from operations. The Index\nProvider calculates a \u201c value score \u201d based on\nthese three variables and assigns weights by\nmultiplying a component's value score by its\nmarket capitalization. Weights in the\nUnderlying Index are next normalized so that\nsectors in the Underlying Index represent\napproximately the same weight as in the Parent\nIndex. MSCI uses an algorithm to determine the\nnumber of components in the Underlying Index\nbased on the number of constituents in the\nParent Index. The number of components is\nevaluated semi-annually. As of July 31, 2024,\nthe Underlying Index consisted of securities\nfrom 350 companies in the following 21\ncountries or regions: Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\nJapan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,\nSingapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the\nUnited Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ). The Underlying\nIndex includes large- and mid-capitalization\ncompanies and may change over time. As of July\n31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the financials and industrials\nindustries or sectors. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by MSCI, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. S-78 Summary of Principal Risks\nAs with any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Securities issued\nby non-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and European Economic Risk . Value\nSecurities Risk . Value securities are those\nissued by companies that may be perceived as\nundervalued. Such securities may decline in\nprice or fail to appreciate for long periods\nof time, and they may never realize their full\npotential value. Value securities may\nunderperform growth securities and other types\nof assets as well as the overall stock market.\nValue securities may go in and out of favor\nover time, which could affect the performance\nof the Fund. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent S-79 limitations\nin such plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Operational Risk . The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited\nto, human error, processing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders, counterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk . The Fund invests in\ncountries or regions whose economies are\nheavily dependent upon trading with key\npartners. Any reduction in this trading may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund's\ninvestments. Through its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers, the Fund is\nspecifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk ,\nEuropean Economic Risk and U.S. Economic Risk\n. Risk of Investing in Developed Countries .\nThe Fund\u2019s investment in developed country\nissuers will subject the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security,\neconomic and other risks associated with\ndeveloped countries. Developed countries tend\nto represent a significant portion of the\nglobal economy and have generally experienced\nslower economic growth than some less\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries have experienced security concerns,\nsuch as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nIn addition, developed countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to the economic\nconditions of certain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price\nor availability of certain commodities. Risk\nof Investing in Japan . Investing in Japanese\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, currency,\ngeographic and security risks that are\nspecific to Japan. Japan\u2019s S-80 economy\ndepends heavily on international trade, oil\nand other commodity imports, and government\npolicy supporting its exports. Other risks\nfacing the Japanese economy include\nsignificant public debt and deficits, currency\nfluctuations, and labor shortages due to an\naging and declining population. Japan\u2019s\nrelations with its neighbors have been\nstrained at times, which could adversely\naffect its markets and economy. Japan is also\nvulnerable to natural disasters. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-81\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-82\n\nManagement Investment Adviser.

Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-83\n\nMore Information About the Funds This\nProspectus contains important information\nabout investing in the Funds listed below.\nPlease read this Prospectus carefully before\nyou make any investment decisions.

are funds that trade like other publicly\ntraded securities. Shares of each Fund are\nlisted on a national securities exchange and\ntrade in the secondary market at market prices\nthat change throughout the day. The market\nprice for a share of a Fund may be different\nfrom the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. Each Fund\ninvests in a particular segment of the markets\nfor securities and other instruments (as\napplicable) and is designed to be used as part\nof broader asset allocation strategies.\nAccordingly, an investment in a Fund should\nnot constitute a complete investment program.\nAn investment in a Fund is not a bank deposit,\nand it is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, any\nother government agency, BFA or any of BFA\u2019s\naffiliates. Index Funds A share of a Fund\nrepresents an ownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of securities and other\ninstruments (as applicable) that is intended\nto track the Fund\u2019s Underlying Index. An index\nis a financial calculation, based on a\ngrouping of financial instruments, and is not\nan investment product, while each Fund is an\nactual investment portfolio. The performance\nof a Fund and that of its Underlying Index may\nvary for a number of reasons, including\ntransaction costs, asset or currency\nvaluations, corporate actions, timing\nvariances and differences between the\ncomposition of a Fund\u2019s portfolio and that of\nthe Underlying Index resulting from the Fund\u2019s\nuse of representative sampling or from legal\nrestrictions (such as diversification\nrequirements) that apply to the Fund but not\nto its Underlying Index. From time to time,\nthe provider of the Underlying Index ( \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ) may make changes to the index\nmethodology or other adjustments to a Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index. Unless otherwise determined\nby BFA, any such change will be reflected in\nthe calculation of the Underlying Index\u2019s\nperformance on a going-forward basis after the\neffective date of such change. Therefore, the\nperformance of the Underlying Index that is\nshown for periods prior to the effective date\nof any such change generally will not be\nrecalculated or restated to reflect the\nchange. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Funds. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of the applicable underlying index.\nBecause the Funds use representative sampling,\nthey can be expected to have a larger tracking\nerror than if they used a replication indexing\nstrategy. \u201c Replication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests in\nsubstantially all of the securities in its\nunderlying index in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying index.\nBorrowing The Fund listed below may borrow as\na temporary measure for extraordinary or\nemergency purposes, including to meet\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The Fund\ndoes not intend to borrow money in order to\nleverage its portfolio. iShares Global Equity\nFactor ETF European Union Disclosure Each Fund\nlisted below has not been categorized under\nthe European Union ( \u201c EU \u201d ) sustainable\nfinance disclosure regulation ( \u201c SFDR \u201d ) as\nan \u201c Article 8 \u201d or \u201c Article 9 \u201d product. In\naddition, each Fund\u2019s investment strategy does\nnot take into account the criteria for\nenvironmentally sustainable economic\nactivities under the EU sustainable investment\ntaxonomy regulation or principal adverse\nimpacts ( \u201c PAIs \u201d ) on sustainability factors\nunder the SFDR. PAIs are identified under the\nSFDR as the material impacts of investment\ndecisions on sustainability factors relating\nto environmental, social and employee matters,\nrespect for human rights, and anti-corruption\nand anti-bribery matters. iShares China Large-\nCap ETF\niShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap ETF 2\n\nAdditional Information About the Funds' Risks\nEach Fund is subject to various risks, any of\nwhich may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV,\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Each Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. You could lose all or part of\nyour investment in a Fund, which could\nunderperform other investments. The table\nbelow identifies the principal and other (non-\nprincipal) risks that apply to each Fund. A\nFund that invests in an Underlying Fund also\nmay be indirectly exposed to these risks\nthrough such investment.

\nAsian Economic Risk. Certain Asian economies\nhave experienced rapid growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, but there\nis no assurance that this growth rate will be\nmaintained. Other Asian economies, however,\nhave experienced high inflation, high\nunemployment, currency devaluations and\nrestrictions, and over-extension of credit.\nGeopolitical hostility, political instability,\nand economic or environmental events in any\none Asian country may have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire Asian region, as\nwell as on major trading partners outside\nAsia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets\nmay have a significant adverse effect on some\nor all of the economies of the countries in\nwhich a Fund invests. In particular, China is\na key trading partner of many Asian countries\nand any changes in trading relationships\nbetween China and other Asian countries may\naffect the region as a whole. Many Asian\ncountries are subject to political risk,\nincluding political instability, corruption\nand regional conflict with neighboring\ncountries. North Korea and South Korea each\nhave substantial military capabilities, and\nhistorical tensions between the two countries\npresent the risk of war. Escalated tensions\ninvolving the two countries and any outbreak\nof hostilities between the two countries, or\neven the threat of an outbreak of hostilities,\ncould have a severe adverse effect on the\nentire Asian region. Certain Asian countries\nhave developed increasingly strained\nrelationships with the U.S. or with China, and\nif these relations were to worsen, they could\nadversely affect Asian issuers that rely on\nthe U.S. or China for trade. In addition, many\nAsian countries are subject to social and\nlabor risks associated with demands for\nimproved political, economic and social\nconditions. These risks, among others, may\nadversely affect the value of a Fund's\ninvestments. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in a Fund\u2019s portfolio or, if\napplicable, its Underlying Index may\nunderperform in comparison to indexes that\ntrack, or assets that represent, other\ncountries or geographic units, industries,\nmarkets, market segments, or asset classes.\nVarious types of securities, other assets and\nindexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and underperformance in\ncomparison to financial markets generally.\nThis divergence may be due to a number of\nfactors including, among other things,\ninflation, interest rates, productivity,\nglobal demand for local products or resources,\nand regulation and governmental controls. This\nmay cause a Fund to underperform other\ninvestment vehicles that invest in different\nasset classes. Australasian Economic Risk. The\neconomies of Australasia, which include\nAustralia and New Zealand, depend on exports\nfrom the energy, agricultural and mining\nsectors and, as a result, are susceptible to\nfluctuations in the commodity markets. These\neconomies also increasingly depend on their\ngrowing service industries. The Australasian\neconomies depend on the economies of their key\ntrading partners, which include China, Japan,\nSouth Korea, the U.S. and certain European\ncountries. Reduced spending by any of these\ntrading partners on Australasian products and\nservices, or negative changes in any of these\neconomies, may have an adverse impact on some\nor all of the Australasian economies. Economic\nevents in key trading countries can have a\nsignificant effect on the Australasian\neconomies.\n\n6\n\nOther risks to Australasian countries include\nnatural disasters that may occur in the region\n(e.g., droughts, earthquakes, fires, tsunamis)\nand national or regional security concerns\n(e.g., terrorism, war, strained international\nrelations). Any such event may adversely\naffect the Australasian economies, financial\nmarkets or issuers of securities, causing an\nadverse impact on the value of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with a Fund.\nThere are a limited number of institutions\nthat may act as Authorized Participants for\nthe Fund, including on an agency basis on\nbehalf of other market participants. No\nAuthorized Participant is obligated to engage\nin creation or redemption transactions. To the\nextent that Authorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation or\nredemption orders for a Fund and no other\nAuthorized Participant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade at a premium\nor discount to NAV and possibly face trading\nhalts or delisting. Authorized Participant\nconcentration risk may be heightened for a\nFund that invests in securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers or instruments with lower\ntrading volume. Such assets often entail\ngreater settlement and operational complexity\nand higher capital costs for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the number of\nAuthorized Participants that engage with the\nFund. Borrowing Risk. Borrowing may exaggerate\nchanges in a Fund\u2019s NAV and in the return on\nits portfolio. A Fund that borrows will incur\ninterest expenses and other fees, which may\nreduce the Fund\u2019s return. Borrowing may also\ncause a Fund to liquidate positions when it\nmay not be advantageous to do so to satisfy\nits obligations. Close-Out Risk for Qualified\nFinancial Contracts. Regulations adopted by\nglobal prudential regulators require\ncounterparties that are part of U.S. or\nforeign global systemically important banking\norganizations to include contractual\nrestrictions on close-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified financial\ncontracts. Qualified financial contracts\ninclude agreements relating to swaps, currency\nforwards and other derivatives as well as\nrepurchase agreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions prevent a Fund\nfrom closing out a qualified financial\ncontract during a specified time period if the\ncounterparty is subject to resolution\nproceedings and also prohibit a Fund from\nexercising default rights due to a\nreceivership or similar proceeding of an\naffiliate of the counterparty. These\nrequirements may increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. Communication Services\nSector Risk. The communication services sector\nconsists of both companies in the\ntelecommunication services industry as well as\nthose in the media and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the telecommunication\nservices industry group include providers of\nfiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services and products\nincluding television broadcasting, gaming\nproducts, social media, networking platforms,\nonline classifieds, online review websites,\nand Internet search engines. Companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be affected\nby industry competition, substantial capital\nrequirements, government regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications products and\nservices due to technological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and international demand,\nshifting demographics and often unpredictable\nchanges in consumer tastes can drastically\naffect a communication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. 7 Concentration Risk. A Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. A Fund with investment concentration\nmay be more adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets, may\nexperience greater price volatility and may be\nmore susceptible to adverse economic, market,\npolitical or regulatory impacts on those\nassets compared to a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments. Consumer Goods\nand Services Companies Risk. Many consumer\ngoods and services companies ( \u201c consumer\ncompanies \u201d ) rely heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending and may\nbe impacted by social trends, marketing\ncampaigns, demographic shifts and other\nfactors affecting consumer preferences and\ndemand. In addition, damage to a brand or a\nreputation crisis can have a substantial\nadverse impact on consumer companies. Certain\nconsumer companies, such as those providing\ndiscretionary goods or services, may depend\nmore on business cycles, overall economic\nconditions and consumer confidence. Many\nconsumer goods and services are subject to\ngovernment regulation and the related\ncompliance costs, and consumer companies also\nface the risk of product liability claims.\nConsumer companies also may be adversely\naffected by volatility in commodity prices,\nsupply chain disruptions and labor shortages.\nCurrency Risk. Because each Fund\u2019s NAV is\ndetermined on the basis of the U.S. dollar,\ninvestors may lose money if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which a Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on repatriation of\nforeign currency, even if the foreign currency\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s holdings in that market\nincreases. Currency exchange rates can be very\nvolatile and can change quickly and\nunpredictably. As a result, a Fund\u2019s NAV may\nchange quickly and without warning. In\naddition, a Fund may incur costs in connection\nwith conversions between U.S. dollars and\nforeign currencies. Custody Risk. Custody risk\nrefers to the risks in the process of clearing\nand settling trades, as well as the holding of\nsecurities and other assets by local banks,\nagents and depositories. These risks are\nheightened in jurisdictions with less\ndeveloped markets or less robust settlement\nand custody infrastructure and processes, and\nthey may result in losses or delays in\npayments, delivery or recovery of money or\nother assets. Low trading volumes and volatile\nprices in less developed markets may make\ntrades harder to complete and settle.\nGovernments or trade groups may compel local\nagents to hold securities and other assets in\ndesignated depositories that may not be\nsubject to independent evaluation. Local\nagents are held only to the standards of care\nof their local markets. In general, the less\ndeveloped a country\u2019s securities markets are,\nthe higher the degree of custody risk.\nCybersecurity Risk. A Fund and entities that\ninteract with the Fund are susceptible to\noperational, information security and related\ncybersecurity risks, both directly and through\ntheir service providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, distributor, other service providers\n( e.g ., index and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer agents and\nadministrators), counterparties, market\nmakers, Authorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market operators,\nand governmental authorities. Cybersecurity\nrisks are also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in which a Fund\ninvests, which could result in material\nadverse consequences for such issuers and may\ncause the Fund\u2019s investment in such issuers to\nlose value. Cyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or unintentional events.\nThey include, but are not limited to, gaining\nunauthorized access to systems,\nmisappropriating assets or sensitive\ninformation, corrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational disruption.\nGeopolitical tensions may increase the scale\nand sophistication of deliberate attacks,\nparticularly those from nation-states or from\nentities with nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions\nand impact business operations and may result\nin any of the following: financial losses,\ninterference with a Fund\u2019s ability to\ncalculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to trading,\nsubmission of erroneous trades or erroneous\ncreation or redemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service providers to transact\nbusiness, violations of applicable privacy and\nother laws, regulatory fines, penalties,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other legal and\ncompliance expenses. In addition, cyber\nincidents may render records of Fund assets\nand transactions, shareholder ownership of\nFund shares, and other data integral to a\nFund\u2019s functioning inaccessible, inaccurate or\nincomplete. A Fund may incur substantial costs\nin order to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. Each Fund has established business\ncontinuity plans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent, cyber\nincidents. However, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that prevention and\nremediation efforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go undetected.\nFurthermore, a Fund cannot control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and other third\nparties whose activities affect the Fund. A\nFund and its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Energy Companies Risk.\nThe energy sector tends to be closely tied to\nthe economic cycle and can be significantly\naffected by supply-demand dynamics and\nvolatility in commodity prices. Energy\ncompanies also may be adversely affected by\nexchange rate fluctuations, war or other\nconflicts, sanctions, import/export controls,\ndepletion of resources, technological advances\nand labor relations. This sector generally is\nsubject to substantial government regulation,\nand companies may incur significant costs in\ncomplying with environmental and other laws.\nPolicies that promote energy conservation,\nclean energy or the transition to low carbon\nalternatives also may affect the performance\nof energy companies. Energy companies may\ndepend on a relatively small number of\ncustomers, including governmental entities and\nutilities. The exploration and production of\nenergy sources and the development of energy\ninfrastructure often require significant\ncapital expenditures, and companies may face\nhigh interest costs and difficulty in raising\ncapital. Energy companies also may face\nchallenges from operating in countries with a\n8 history of adverse policies or events, such\nas expropriation, confiscation of assets,\ncorruption, political instability and social\nunrest. The operations of energy companies may\nbe disrupted by events that target or damage\nenergy infrastructure, including cyber or\nother attacks, accidents and natural\ndisasters. Energy companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. The energy sector may\nexperience significant market volatility. For\nexample, Russia\u2019s large-scale invasion of\nUkraine in 2022 led to disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nimposed various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. It is impossible to predict the\neffect of current or future sanctions and\nrestrictions, the extent and duration of the\nconflict, and associated disruptions in the\nenergy sector. The effect of these events or\nany related developments could be significant\nand may have a severe adverse effect on a\nFund\u2019s performance. Equity Securities Risk.\nEquity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue due to general market or economic\nconditions, perceptions about the markets in\nwhich issuers participate or a number of\nfactors relating to a specific issuer.\nInvestments in equity securities may be more\nvolatile than investments in other asset\nclasses. Equity securities (both common and\npreferred stock) are subordinated to debt\nsecurities in a company\u2019s capital structure,\nand so equity holders are generally subject to\nmore risks, particularly in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Common stock has the\nlowest priority and the greatest risks,\nincluding with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments. ESG Risk. To the extent\nthat a Fund\u2019s Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. An Underlying Index\u2019s use of\nESG criteria may result in a Fund investing\nin, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\nthe divergence of a Fund's overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. An Index Provider evaluates\nsecurities for inclusion and/or weighting in\nsuch an Underlying Index based on ESG criteria\nand data provided by the Index Provider or\nthird parties. The Index Provider\u2019s evaluation\nof securities\u2019 ESG characteristics depends on\nthese criteria and data, which may vary by\nindex provider, and no assurance can be given\nthat they will be complete, accurate or\ncurrent. In addition, an Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data (including\nratings) and, if applicable, ESG objectives or\nconstraints that are relevant to an Underlying\nIndex only at index reviews or rebalances.\nSecurities included in an Underlying Index may\ncease to meet the relevant ESG criteria but\nmay nevertheless remain in the Underlying\nIndex and in the Fund using the Underlying\nIndex until the next review or rebalance by\nthe Index Provider. As a result, certain\nsecurities in the Underlying Index, or the\nUnderlying Index as a whole, may not meet the\nrelevant ESG objectives or constraints at all\ntimes. If the ESG assessment of a security in\nan Underlying Index or a Fund changes, neither\nthe Fund nor BFA accepts any liability in\nrelation to such change. BFA does not monitor\nsecurities in an Underlying Index with respect\nto ESG objectives or constraints applied by\nthe Index Provider and is not responsible for\nchanges to the ESG assessment of a security in\nan Underlying Index between rebalances. In\naddition, BFA does not assess the validity of\nan Index Provider\u2019s evaluation of the ESG\ncharacteristics of securities or the criteria\nand data used in such evaluation. The impacts\nof risks related to ESG investing are likely\nto change over time, and new ESG risks may be\nidentified as further data and information\nregarding ESG factors and impacts become\navailable. In addition, methodologies for ESG\ninvesting continue to develop, and the ESG\nmethodology applied by an Index Provider may\nchange over time. European Economic Risk. The\nEconomic and Monetary Union (the \u201c eurozone \u201d\n) of the EU requires compliance by member\nstates that are members of the eurozone with\nrestrictions on inflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates and debt levels, as well as\nfiscal and monetary controls, each of which\nmay significantly affect every country in\nEurope, including those countries that are not\nmembers of the eurozone. Additionally,\nEuropean countries outside of the eurozone may\npresent economic risks that are independent of\nthe indirect effects that eurozone policies\nhave on them. In particular, the U.K.'s\neconomy may be affected by global economic,\nindustrial and financial shifts. Changes in\nimports or exports, changes in governmental or\nEU regulations on trade, changes in the\nexchange rate of the euro (the common currency\nof eurozone countries), the default or threat\nof default by an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt and/or an economic recession in\nan EU member state may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other EU\nmember states and their trading partners. The\nEuropean financial markets have historically\nexperienced volatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic downturns or\ngovernment debt levels in several European\ncountries, including, but not limited to,\nAustria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.\nThese events have affected and may in the\nfuture adversely affect the exchange rate of\nthe euro and may significantly affect European\ncountries. Responses to financial problems by\nEuropean governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the desired results,\nmay result in social unrest, may limit future\ngrowth and economic recovery or may have other\nunintended consequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and other\nentities of their debt could have additional\nadverse effects on economies, financial\nmarkets and asset valuations around the world.\nIn addition, one or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K.\nleft the EU ( \u201c Brexit \u201d ) on January 31,\n2020. Brexit could adversely affect European\nor worldwide political, regulatory, economic\nor market conditions and could contribute to\ninstability in global political institutions,\nregulatory agencies and financial markets. The\nnational politics of countries in Europe have\nbeen unpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding, for example, secessionist\nmovements. The governments of European\ncountries may be subject to change and such\ncountries may 9 experience social and\npolitical unrest. Unanticipated or sudden\npolitical or social developments may result in\nsudden and significant investment losses. The\noccurrence of terrorist incidents throughout\nEurope or war in the region could also impact\nfinancial markets. The impact of these events\nis not clear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of a Fund's investments. Russian\nInvasion of Ukraine . Russia launched a large-\nscale invasion of Ukraine on February 24,\n2022. The extent and duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and resulting\nfuture market disruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the value of the\nruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible\nto predict, but could be significant.\nDisruptions caused by Russian military action\nor other actions (including cyberattacks and\nespionage) or resulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity, including\npurchasing and financing restrictions,\nboycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser\npreferences, sanctions, import and export\nrestrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian companies or\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nmay impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which a Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Financial Companies Risk. Financial\nservices companies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation and intervention,\nwhich may change frequently and may adversely\naffect their profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions, credit\nrating downgrades, adverse public perception\nand exposure concentration. Increased risk-\ntaking by financial companies may result in\ngreater overall risk in the global financial\nsector. Certain events may cause an unusually\nhigh degree of volatility in financial markets\nand pose the risk of large losses for\nfinancial services companies. Financial\ncompanies frequently operate with substantial\nfinancial leverage and are exposed directly to\nthe credit risk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, which also may be leveraged to\nan unknown degree. Financial companies may\nhave significant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties; as a result, a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother financial companies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk may result in\nsignificant negative impacts to companies with\ndirect exposure to the defaulting counterparty\nas well as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financial sector generally.\nGeographic and Security Risks. Issuers in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio may be located in, or\notherwise connected to, parts of the world\naffected by natural disasters, such as severe\nheat, earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic\neruptions, wildfires, droughts, floods,\nhurricanes and tsunamis. In addition, issuers\nmay be impacted by security concerns with\nrespect to a country or region, such as war\nand other types of conflict, terrorism,\nstrained international relations and\nterritorial disputes. Any of these events may\nadversely affect the issuers, markets and\neconomies to which a Fund is exposed, which\nmay adversely affect the value of the Fund.\nGrowth Securities Risk. Growth securities are\nthose issued by companies whose earnings\ngrowth potential appears to be greater than\nthe market in general and whose revenue growth\nis expected to continue for an extended period\nof time. Growth securities may trade at higher\nmultiples of current earnings compared to\nvalue or other stocks, leading to inflated\nprices and thus potentially greater declines\nin market value. The prices of growth\nsecurities may be more volatile than those of\nother types of investments and can decline\nrapidly and significantly in reaction to\nnegative news. Growth securities may\nunderperform value securities and other types\nof assets as well as the overall stock market.\nUnder certain market conditions, growth\nsecurities have performed better during the\nlater stages of economic recovery, although\nthere is no assurance that they will continue\nto do so. Growth securities typically do not\npay a dividend, which can help cushion stock\nprices in market downturns and reduce\npotential losses. Growth securities may go in\nand out of favor over time, which could affect\nthe performance of a Fund with such holdings.\nHealthcare Companies Risk. The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by the following factors, among\nothers: extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, a\nlimited number of products, labor shortages,\nsupply chain issues and industry innovation.\nMany new products in the healthcare sector\nentail significant research and development\nand require regulatory approval, all of which\nmay be long and costly, and such efforts\nultimately may be unsuccessful. Many\nhealthcare companies depend heavily on\nobtaining and defending patents, which can be\ncostly, and may be adversely affected by the\nexpiration of patents. Healthcare companies\nalso are subject to extensive litigation based\non product liability and similar claims.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nAn investment may be illiquid due to, among\nother things, fewer participants or less\ncapacity to make a market in the investment,\nthe lack of an active market for the\ninvestment, capital controls, delays or limits\non repatriation of local currency, and the\ninsolvency of local governments. To the extent\nthat a Fund invests in securities or other\nassets with substantial market and/or credit\nrisk, the Fund will tend to have increased\nexposure to the risks associated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid investments may be\nharder to value, especially in changing\nmarkets. Liquid investments may become\nilliquid after purchase by a Fund,\nparticularly during periods of market turmoil.\nThere can be no assurance that a security or\nother asset that is deemed to be liquid when\npurchased will continue to be liquid for as\nlong as it is held by a Fund, and any security\nor other asset held by a Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk management program. 10 Holdings\nof illiquid investments may reduce a Fund\u2019s\nreturns because the Fund may be unable to\ntransact at advantageous times or prices. If a\nFund is forced to sell underlying investments\nat reduced prices or under unfavorable\nconditions to meet redemption requests or for\nother cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss.\nThis may be magnified in a rising interest\nrate environment or other circumstances where\nredemptions of Fund shares may be greater than\nnormal. If other market participants attempt\nto liquidate holdings at the same time as a\nFund, this will lead to an increased supply of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying investments in the\nmarket and contribute to greater illiquid\ninvestments risk and downward pricing\npressure. In addition, if a Fund is limited in\nits ability to sell illiquid investments\nduring periods when shareholders are redeeming\ntheir shares, the Fund will need to sell\nliquid securities to meet redemption requests,\nand illiquid securities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings. During periods\nof market volatility, liquidity in the market\nfor a Fund\u2019s shares may be impacted by the\nliquidity in the market for the underlying\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund,\nwhich could lead to the Fund\u2019s shares trading\nat a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.\nIndex-Related Risk. A Fund that tracks an\nUnderlying Index seeks to achieve a return\nthat corresponds generally to the price and\nyield performance, before fees and expenses,\nof its Underlying Index as published by the\nIndex Provider. There is no assurance that the\nIndex Provider or its agents will construct or\ncalculate the Underlying Index accurately.\nWhile the Index Provider describes what the\nUnderlying Index is designed to achieve,\nneither the Index Provider nor its agents\nprovide any warranty or accept any liability\nregarding the quality, accuracy or\ncompleteness of the Underlying Index or its\nrelated data, and they do not guarantee that\nthe Underlying Index will be in line with the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology. BFA also does\nnot provide any warranty or guarantee against\nthe Index Provider\u2019s or any agent\u2019s errors.\nThe Index Provider may rely on various sources\nof information to assess the criteria of\ncomponents of the Underlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on assumptions\nand estimates. Neither a Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology or sources of information will\nprovide an accurate assessment of included\ncomponents or will result in the Fund meeting\nits investment objective. Errors in index\ndata, index computations or the construction\nof an Underlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, particularly for indexes that are less\ncommonly used as benchmarks. In addition,\nthere may be heightened risks associated with\nthe adequacy and reliability of information\nabout emerging markets constituents, as such\nmarkets may have less information available or\nless regulatory oversight. Errors related to\nan Underlying Index may negatively or\npositively impact a Fund and its shareholders.\nFor example, if the Underlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund will have\nexposure to such constituents and will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying Index\u2019s other\nconstituents. Shareholders should understand\nthat any gains from an Index Provider\u2019s errors\nwill be kept by the Fund and its shareholders\nand any losses or costs from such errors will\nbe borne by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnusual market conditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural disasters,\npolitical unrest or war) may impact an Index\nProvider or a third-party data provider and\ncould cause the Index Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to an Underlying Index.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. If a\nscheduled rebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that would otherwise be removed\nat the rebalance (due to, for example, changes\nin market capitalization or issuer credit\nratings) may remain, causing the performance\nand constituents of the Underlying Index to\nvary from those expected under normal\nconditions. In addition, to the extent\ncircumstances evolve between periodic index\nreviews and reconstitutions, an Underlying\nIndex may include constituents that do not\nalign with its objective or selection\ncriteria, and the Fund tracking the Underlying\nIndex may be similarly affected. In addition\nto scheduled rebalances, an Index Provider or\nits agents may carry out ad hoc index\nrebalances due to reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market conditions,\ncorporate events, or corrections of errors.\nThe relevant Fund will in turn rebalance its\nportfolio to attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the portfolio and the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund and its\nshareholders will directly bear any\ntransaction costs and market exposure from\nsuch portfolio rebalancing. Therefore, index-\nrelated errors and ad hoc rebalances may\nincrease a Fund\u2019s costs and tracking error.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, third-party vendor\nrisks, cyber attacks, trade disputes, product\nrecalls, liability and environmental damage\nclaims, scarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe products of industrial companies may face\nobsolescence due to technological developments\nand new product introduction. Furthermore,\nchanges in trade restrictions and tariffs as\nwell as broader geopolitical developments\ncould adversely affect industrial companies.\nThese companies also may be significantly\naffected by domestic and international\neconomic conditions, legislative and\nregulatory changes, and labor relations.\nIndustrial companies may depend on public or\nprivate sector financing, which may become\ndifficult to obtain due to government spending\nconstraints or reduced availability of\ncapital. Such companies may be unable to\nprotect their intellectual property rights or\nmay be liable for infringing the intellectual\nproperty rights of others. Issuers with high\ncarbon intensity or high switching costs\nassociated with the transition to low carbon\nalternatives may be more impacted by climate\ntransition risks. There may be increased\nimpact on a Fund's performance to the extent\nthat its investments are concentrated in\nlocations that are more susceptible to adverse\nphysical events. Issuer Risk. The performance\nof a Fund depends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other assets to which\nthe Fund has exposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited 11\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of a\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or loan Fund\nshares (to secure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party. There can be no\nassurance that any large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment or that the size of a Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares may adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the extent a Fund\npermits redemptions in cash, these redemptions\nmay force the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material effect on the\nmarket price of Fund shares, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains, and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such tax year. A\nFund also may be required to sell its more\nliquid investments to meet a large redemption,\nin which case the Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile, and more\ndifficult to price. To the extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund shares on the\nsecondary market, such transactions may\naccount for a large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may, therefore,\nhave a material upward or downward effect on\nthe market price of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s performance to the extent\nthat the Fund is delayed in investing new cash\nand is required to maintain a larger cash\nposition than it ordinarily would, diluting\nits investment returns. Low Volatility Risk. A\nlow volatility strategy may underperform the\nbroader market during periods of strong,\nrising or speculative stock prices. In\naddition, there is a risk that a Fund with\nsuch an investment strategy may experience\nmore than minimum volatility. Securities in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio may be subject to price\nvolatility, and their prices may not be less\nvolatile (and could be more volatile) than the\nmarket as a whole, which could adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s NAV. Management Risk. An\nindex Fund invests in securities or other\nassets included in, or representative of, its\nUnderlying Index, regardless of their\ninvestment merits. Such a Fund may be affected\nby a general decline in market segments\nrelated to its Underlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to invest the\nFund\u2019s assets in defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. Market disruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an adverse effect on a\nFund\u2019s ability to adjust its exposure to the\nrequired levels in order to track its\nUnderlying Index. Because BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy, a\nFund will not fully replicate its Underlying\nIndex and may hold securities or other assets\nnot included in the Underlying Index. As a\nresult, a Fund is subject to the risk that\nBFA\u2019s investment strategy, whose\nimplementation is subject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the intended\nresults. There is no guarantee that a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a high degree of\ncorrelation to those of its Underlying Index\nor that a Fund will achieve its investment\nobjective. Market Risk. A Fund could lose\nmoney over short periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over longer periods\nduring more prolonged market downturns. The\nvalue of a financial instrument or other asset\nmay decline due to changes in general market\nconditions, economic trends or events that are\nnot specifically related to the particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors that affect\none or more issuers, counterparties,\nexchanges, countries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or asset classes.\nLocal, regional or global events such as war,\nacts of terrorism, pandemics or other public\nhealth issues, recessions, the prospect or\noccurrence of a sovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments and could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s NAV. Changes\nin market and economic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all types of\ninstruments and assets. Market Trading Risk. A\nFund faces numerous market trading risks, any\nof which may lead to its shares trading in the\nsecondary market at a premium or discount to\nNAV or to the intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy Fund shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto NAV or sell Fund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a discount to the NAV, you\nmay pay significantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the underlying value\nof the Fund shares. Absence of an Active\nPrimary Market. Although Fund shares are\nlisted for trading on one or more stock\nexchanges, there can be no assurance that an\nactive primary trading market for Fund shares\nwill develop or be maintained by market makers\nor Authorized Participants. Secondary Listing\nRisks. A Fund\u2019s shares may be listed or traded\non U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other\nthan the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing is maintained. Fund shares\nalso may be available to non-U.S. investors\nthrough funds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary receipts. There\ncan be no assurance that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to trade on any such stock exchange\nor in any market or that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to meet the requirements for exchange\nlisting or market trading. A Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe less actively traded in certain markets\nthan in others, and investors are subject to\nthe execution and settlement risks and market\nstandards of the market where they or their\nbroker direct their trades for execution.\nCertain information that is available to\ninvestors who trade Fund shares on a U.S.\nstock exchange during regular U.S. market\nhours may not be available to investors who\ntrade in other markets, which may result in\nsecondary market prices in such markets being\nless efficient. Secondary Market Trading Risk.\nShares of a Fund may trade in the secondary\nmarket at times when the Fund does not accept\norders to create or redeem shares. At such\ntimes, shares may trade in the secondary\nmarket with more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might 12 be experienced\nat times when the Fund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities held by a Fund\nmay be traded in markets that close at a\ndifferent time than an exchange on which Fund\nshares are traded. Liquidity in those\nsecurities may be reduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during the time\nwhen the exchange is open but after the\napplicable market closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be wider bid/ask\nspreads on the exchange and a greater premium\nor discount to NAV. In stressed market\nconditions, the market for a Fund\u2019s shares may\nbecome less liquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the markets for the\nFund\u2019s portfolio holdings, and an investor may\nbe unable to sell their Fund shares. Secondary\nmarket trading in Fund shares may be halted by\na stock exchange because of market conditions\nor for other reasons. In times of\nextraordinary market volatility, Fund shares\nmay be subject to trading halts pursuant to \u201c\ncircuit breaker \u201d rules of a stock exchange or\nmarket. If there is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an exchange or\nmarket, an investor may be unable to purchase\nor sell Fund shares. In addition, if trading\nin certain securities or financial instruments\nis restricted, this may disrupt a Fund\u2019s\ncreation/redemption process, affect the price\nat which Fund shares trade in the secondary\nmarket, and result in a Fund being unable to\ntrade certain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such circumstances, a Fund may\nbe unable to rebalance its portfolio or\naccurately price its portfolio holdings and\nmay incur substantial trading losses. Shares\nof a Fund, similar to shares of other issuers\nlisted on a stock exchange, may be sold short\nand are therefore subject to the risk of\nincreased volatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short. In addition,\ntrading activity in derivative products based\non a Fund may lead to increased trading volume\nand volatility in the secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares May Trade at\nPrices Other Than NAV . Shares of a Fund trade\non stock exchanges at prices at, above or\nbelow the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. A Fund\u2019s NAV\nis calculated at the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in the market\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings. The\ntrading price of a Fund\u2019s shares fluctuates\nthroughout trading hours based on both market\nsupply of and demand for Fund shares and the\nunderlying value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the trading\nprices of a Fund\u2019s shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant redemption requests,\nor other unusual market conditions However,\nbecause Fund shares can be created and\nredeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or premiums to a\nFund\u2019s NAV are not likely to be sustained over\nthe long term (unlike shares of many closed-\nend funds, which frequently trade at\nappreciable discounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While the\ncreation/redemption feature is designed to\nmake it more likely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock exchanges at\nprices close to the Fund\u2019s next calculated\nNAV, exchange prices are not expected to\ncorrelate exactly with the Fund\u2019s NAV due to\ntiming reasons, supply and demand imbalances\nand other factors. In addition, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers, Authorized\nParticipants, or other market participants,\nand during periods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading prices for\nshares of a Fund that differ significantly\nfrom its NAV. Authorized Participants may be\nless willing to create or redeem a Fund\u2019s\nshares if there is a lack of an active market\nfor such shares or the Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments, which may contribute to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or Selling Fund\nShares. Buying or selling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of costs that\napply to all securities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you will likely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is\nthe difference between what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares (the \u201c bid \u201d\nprice) and the price at which they are willing\nto sell Fund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price). The\nspread varies over time for Fund shares based\non trading volume and market liquidity. It is\ngenerally narrower if a Fund has more trading\nvolume and market liquidity and wider if a\nFund has less trading volume and market\nliquidity. Increased market volatility also\nmay cause wider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other charges that are\nincurred as a result of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in buying or\nselling Fund shares, frequent trading may\ndetract significantly from investment results,\nand an investment in Fund shares may not be\nadvisable for investors who anticipate\nregularly making small investments through a\nbrokerage account. Materials Companies Risk.\nThe materials sector tends to be closely tied\nto the economic cycle and can be significantly\naffected by supply-demand dynamics. Materials\ncompanies may be adversely affected by\ncommodity price volatility, exchange rate\nfluctuations, social and political unrest,\nwar, import and export controls, supply chain\ndisruption, increased competition, depletion\nof resources, technical advances, labor\nrelations, litigation and government\nregulations, among other factors. Materials\ncompanies are at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may incur significant costs in\ncomplying with environmental laws. Mid-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Investments in\nmid-capitalization companies may be riskier,\nless liquid, more volatile and more\nsusceptible to economic, market and industry\nchanges than investments in large-\ncapitalization companies. Mid-capitalization\ncompanies may have more limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources and management\nexperience. As a result, they generally are\nmore vulnerable than large-capitalization\ncompanies to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Mid-capitalization companies may\nhave a shorter business track record, with\nrelatively less information available to\ninvestors. The securities of mid-sized\ncompanies may trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than the securities of larger\ncompanies. Momentum Securities Risk.\nSecurities that previously exhibited greater\nmomentum characteristics than other securities\nmay not continue to experience positive\nmomentum, and such a change could occur\nquickly. Momentum securities may experience\nmore volatility than the market as a whole,\nand their returns may be less than the returns\nof other styles of investing or the overall\nstock market. A Fund that invests in momentum\nsecurities may experience significant losses\nif momentum stops, reverses or otherwise\nbehaves differently than predicted. In\naddition, there may be periods when the\nmomentum style of investing is out of favor,\nand the investment performance of a Fund may\nsuffer during such period. 13 National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by a Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on a Fund is likely\nto be greater where a large portion of the\nFund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Non-Diversification Risk. A\nFund that is classified as \u201c non-diversified \u201d\nmay invest a greater percentage of its assets\nin securities or other instruments\nrepresenting a small number of issuers or\ncounterparties, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified. \u201d A non-\ndiversified Fund thus may be more susceptible\nto the risks associated with these particular\nissuers or counterparties. The gains and\nlosses on such holdings may have a greater\nimpact on a non-diversified Fund\u2019s performance\nthan they would on the performance of a\ndiversified Fund, and a non-diversified Fund\u2019s\nNAV may be more volatile. Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to\ndifferent legal, regulatory, political,\neconomic, and market risks than securities\nissued by U.S. issuers. To the extent that a\nFund makes investments in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nrisks of investing in non-U.S. securities\ninclude the following, any of which may have\nan adverse impact on a Fund: \u25a0 Less liquid\nmarkets, which may make valuing securities\nmore difficult; \u25a0 Greater market volatility; \u25a0\nGovernment intervention in issuers' operations\nor structure; \u25a0 Government expropriation or\nnationalization of assets; \u25a0 Exchange rate\nfluctuations and exchange controls; \u25a0\nLimitations on foreign ownership of\nsecurities; \u25a0 Imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; \u25a0 Restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital; \u25a0 Higher transaction\nand custody costs; \u25a0 Foreign market trading\nhours, different clearing and settlement\nprocedures, and holiday schedules, which may\nlimit a Fund's ability to engage in portfolio\ntransactions; \u25a0 Less regulation of the\nsecurities and other financial markets; \u25a0 Less\navailability of public information about\nissuers; \u25a0 Weaker accounting, audit,\ndisclosure and financial reporting\nrequirements and the risk of being delisted\nfrom U.S. exchanges; \u25a0 Difficulties in\nenforcing contractual obligations; and \u25a0 Legal\nprincipals relating to corporate governance,\ndirectors\u2019 fiduciary duties and liabilities,\nand shareholder rights that are less robust\nthan those that apply in the U.S. Withholding\nTax Reclaims Risk . A Fund that holds non-U.S.\nsecurities may file claims to recover\nwithholding tax on dividend and interest\nincome (if any) received from issuers in\ncertain countries where such withholding tax\nreclaim is possible. Whether or when a Fund\nwill receive a withholding tax refund is\nwithin the control of the tax authorities in\nsuch countries. Where a Fund expects to\nrecover withholding tax based on a continuous\nassessment of the probability of recovery, the\nFund\u2019s NAV generally includes accruals for\nsuch tax refunds. Funds continue to evaluate\ntax developments for potential impact to the\nprobability of recovery. If the likelihood of\nreceiving a tax refund materially decreases,\nsuch as due to a change in tax regulation or\napproach, accruals in a Fund\u2019s NAV for such\nrefunds may be written down partially or in\nfull, which will adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Investors in a Fund at the time when an\naccrual is written down will bear the impact\nof any resulting reduction in NAV regardless\nof whether they were investors during the\naccrual period. Conversely, if a Fund receives\na tax refund that was not previously accrued,\ninvestors in the Fund at the time the claim is\nsuccessful will benefit from any resulting\nincrease in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Investors who sold\ntheir shares prior to such time will not\nbenefit from any such NAV increase.\nOperational Risk. Each Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. Each Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Quality Securities Risk.\nSecurities that previously exhibited greater\nquality characteristics than other securities\nmay not continue to be quality securities.\nMany factors can impact a security\u2019s quality\nand performance, and such factors and their\nimpact may be difficult to predict. The\nreturns of quality securities may be less than\nthe returns of other styles of investing or\nthe overall stock market. In addition, there\nmay be periods when the quality style of\ninvesting is out of favor, and the investment\nperformance of a Fund may suffer during such\nperiod. Real Estate Companies Risk. Real\nestate companies, which include real estate\ninvestment trusts, real estate holding and\noperating companies, and real estate\nmanagement or development companies, expose\ninvestors to the risks of owning real estate\ndirectly as well as to the risks from the way\nthat such companies operate. Real estate\ncompanies and property values may be adversely\naffected by regulations 14 and other\ngovernmental actions, including tax increases,\nzoning changes and other usage restrictions,\nenvironmental regulations, regulatory\nlimitations on rent or eviction, and eminent\ndomain. Real estate is highly sensitive to\ngeneral and local economic conditions and can\nbe subject to intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Real estate companies may own a\nlimited number of properties and concentrate\ntheir investments in a particular geographic\nregion, industry or property type. Economic\ndownturns or other adverse events ( e.g. ,\nnatural disasters) that affect a particular\nregion, industry or property type may lead to\ndecreases in property values, leasing declines\nand defaults by borrowers or tenants. In the\nevent of a default, a real estate company may\nexperience substantial delays and costs in\nenforcing its rights with respect to the\nproperty and protecting its investment. In\naddition, because real estate is relatively\nilliquid, a company may be constrained in its\nability to diversify or liquidate its\ninvestments in response to economic conditions\nor other events. Real estate companies may\ndepend on the management skills of a few key\nindividuals and may have limited financial\nresources. They may be highly leveraged, which\ncan magnify losses, and interest rate\nincreases can make it difficult for them, as\nwell as borrowers and tenants, to obtain debt\nfinancing and meet payment obligations.\nDeclining interest rates could result in\nincreased prepayment on loans and require\nredeployment of capital in less desirable\ninvestments. Certain real estate companies,\nsuch as REITs, could fail to qualify for\nfavorable tax or regulatory treatment, which\ncould produce adverse economic consequences\nfor the company and its investors, including a\nFund. Reliance on Trading Partners Risk. The\neconomies of some countries or regions in\nwhich the Fund invests are dependent on\ntrading with certain key trading partners.\nReduction in spending on the products and\nservices of these countries or regions,\ninstitution of tariffs or other trade barriers\nby any of their key trading partners or a\nslowdown in the economies of any of their key\ntrading partners may cause an adverse impact\non the economies of such countries or regions.\nRisk of Investing in China. Investments in\nChinese securities, including certain Hong\nKong-listed and U.S.-listed securities,\nsubject the Fund to risks specific to China.\nThe Chinese economy is subject to a\nconsiderable degree of economic, political and\nsocial instability. Political and Social Risk.\nThe Chinese government is authoritarian and\nhas periodically used force to suppress civil\ndissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of\neconomic liberalization may lead to social\nturmoil, violence and labor unrest. In\naddition, China continues to experience\ndisagreements related to integration with Hong\nKong and religious and nationalist disputes in\nTibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater\nrisk in China than in many other countries of\ncurrency fluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate fluctuations and\nhigher rates of inflation as a result of\ninternal social unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries. Unanticipated political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. China's growing\nincome inequality, rapidly aging population\nand significant environmental issues also are\nfactors that may affect the Chinese economy.\nGovernment Control and Regulations. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, government control over certain\nsectors or enterprises and significant\nregulation of investment and industry is still\npervasive, including restrictions on\ninvestment in companies or industries deemed\nto be sensitive to particular national\ninterests, trading of securities of Chinese\nissuers, foreign ownership of Chinese\ncorporations and/or the repatriation of assets\nby foreign investors. Limitations or\nrestrictions on foreign ownership of\nsecurities may have adverse effects on the\nliquidity and performance of the Fund and\ncould lead to higher tracking error. Chinese\ngovernment intervention in the market may have\na negative impact on market sentiment, which\nmay in turn affect the performance of the\nChinese economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nChinese markets generally continue to\nexperience inefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies that may be connected to\ngovernmental influence, lack of publicly\navailable information, and political and\nsocial instability. Chinese companies, such as\nthose in the financial services or technology\nsectors, and potentially other sectors are\nalso subject to the risk that Chinese\nauthorities can intervene in their operations\nand structure, which may negatively affect the\nvalue of a Fund's investments. Economic Risk.\nThe Chinese economy may be adversely affected\nby, among other things, a deterioration in\nglobal demand for Chinese exports or a\ncontraction in spending on domestic goods by\nChinese consumers. In addition, China may\nexperience substantial rates of inflation,\nsignificant indebtedness or economic\nrecessions, which would have a negative effect\non its economy and securities market. Delays\nin enterprise restructuring, slow development\nof well-functioning financial markets and\nwidespread corruption have also hindered the\nperformance of the Chinese economy. China\ncontinues to receive substantial pressure from\ntrading partners to liberalize official\ncurrency exchange rates. Reduction in spending\non Chinese products and services, institution\nof additional tariffs or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions between China and the U.S. or in\nresponse to actual or alleged Chinese cyber\nactivity) or a downturn in any of the\neconomies of China\u2019s key trading partners may\nhave an adverse impact on the Chinese economy\nand the Chinese issuers of securities in which\nthe Fund invests. For example, the U.S. has\nadded certain foreign technology companies to\nthe U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of\nIndustry and Security\u2019s \u201c Entity List, \u201d which\nis a list of companies believed to pose a\nnational security risk to the U.S. Actions\nlike these may have unanticipated and\ndisruptive effects on the Chinese economy. Any\nsuch response that targets Chinese financial\nmarkets or securities exchanges could\ninterfere with orderly trading, delay\nsettlement or cause market disruptions.\nExpropriation Risk. The Chinese government\nmaintains a major role in economic\npolicymaking, and investing in China involves\nrisk of loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and on repatriation of\ncapital invested. 15 Security Risk . China has\nstrained international relations with Taiwan,\nJapan, India, Russia and other neighbors due\nto territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, defense concerns and other\nsecurity concerns. China has a complex\nterritorial dispute regarding the sovereignty\nof Taiwan and has pledged to take control of\nTaiwan, including by force if necessary. The\nChinese military has conducted military drills\naround Taiwan in connection with China\u2019s claim\nto Taiwan. Taiwan-based companies and\nindividuals are significant investors in\nChina. These tensions between Taiwan and China\nmay adversely affect the Chinese economy.\nAdditionally, China is alleged to have\nparticipated in state-sponsored cyberattacks\nagainst foreign companies and foreign\ngovernments. Actual and threatened responses\nto such activity and strained international\nrelations, including purchasing restrictions,\nsanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nChinese government or Chinese companies, may\nimpact China\u2019s economy and Chinese issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund invests.\nRelations between China\u2019s Han ethnic majority\nand other ethnic groups in China, including\nTibetans and Uighurs, are also strained and\nhave been marked by protests and violence.\nThese situations may cause uncertainty in the\nChinese market and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy. In addition, conflict on the\nKorean Peninsula could adversely affect the\nChinese economy. Such risks, among others, may\nadversely affect the value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. Chinese Equity Markets. The Fund\ninvests in Chinese securities, including\nH-shares, A-shares, B-shares, Red-Chips and/or\nP-Chips. The issuance of B-shares and H-shares\nby Chinese companies and the ability to obtain\na \u201c back-door listing \u201d through Red-Chips or\nP-Chips is still regarded by the Chinese\nauthorities as an experiment in economic\nreform. \u201c Back-door listing \u201d is a means by\nwhich a mainland Chinese company issues Red-\nChips or P-Chips to obtain quick access to\ninternational listing and international\ncapital. These share mechanisms are subject to\nthe political and economic policies in China.\nHong Kong Political Risk . Hong Kong reverted\nto Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997 as a\nSpecial Administrative Region ( \u201c SAR \u201d ) of\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China ( \u201c PRC \u201d )\nunder the principle of \u201c one country, two\nsystems. \u201d Although China is obligated to\nmaintain the current capitalist economic and\nsocial system of Hong Kong through June 30,\n2047, the continuation of economic and social\nfreedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong is dependent on\nthe government of China. Since 1997, there\nhave been tensions between the Chinese\ngovernment and many people in Hong Kong who\nperceive China as tightening control over Hong\nKong\u2019s semi-autonomous liberal political,\neconomic, legal and social framework. Recent\nprotests and unrest have increased tensions\neven further. Due to the interconnected nature\nof the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this\ninstability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty\nin the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. In\naddition, the Hong Kong dollar trades at a\nfixed exchange rate in relation to (or is \u201c\npegged \u201d to) the U.S. dollar, which has\ncontributed to the growth and stability of the\nHong Kong economy. However, it is uncertain\nhow long the currency peg will continue or\nwhat effect the establishment of an\nalternative exchange rate system would have on\nthe Hong Kong economy. Because the Fund\u2019s NAV\nis denominated in U.S. dollars, the\nestablishment of an alternative exchange rate\nsystem could result in a decline in the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Limited Information and Legal Remedies .\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Funds invest\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they do not meet\nU.S. accounting standards and auditor\noversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Funds do not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. Risk of Investing\nin Developed Countries. Investment in\ndeveloped country issuers will subject the\nFunds to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries generally tend to rely on services\nsectors ( e.g., the financial services sector)\nas the primary means of economic growth. A\nprolonged slowdown in one or more services\nsectors is likely to have a negative impact on\neconomies of certain developed countries,\nalthough economies of individual developed\ncountries can be impacted by slowdowns in\nother sectors. In the past, certain developed\ncountries have been targets of terrorism, and\nsome geographic areas in which the Fund\ninvests have experienced strained\ninternational relations due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities, defense\nconcerns and other security concerns. These\nsituations may cause uncertainty in the\nfinancial markets in these countries or\ngeographic areas and may adversely affect the\nperformance of the issuers to which the Fund\nhas exposure. Heavy regulation of certain\nmarkets, including labor and product markets,\nmay have an adverse effect on certain issuers.\nSuch regulations may negatively affect\neconomic growth or cause prolonged periods of\nrecession. Many developed countries are\nheavily indebted and face rising healthcare\nand retirement expenses. In addition, price\nfluctuations of certain commodities and\nregulations impacting the import of\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Risk of Investing in\nEmerging Markets. Investments in emerging\nmarket issuers are subject to a greater risk\nof loss than investments in issuers located or\noperating in more developed markets. This is\ndue to, among other things, the potential for\ngreater market volatility, lower trading\nvolume, higher levels of inflation, social,\npolitical or economic instability, greater\nrisk of a market shutdown and more\ngovernmental limitations on foreign\ninvestments in emerging market countries than\nare typically found in more developed markets.\nSome countries in which the Fund may invest\nmay experience economic instability, including\ninstability resulting from substantial rates\nof inflation or significant devaluations of\ntheir currency, or economic recessions, which\nwould have a negative effect on the economies\nand securities markets of their economies.\nSome of these countries may also impose\nrestrictions on the exchange or export of\ncurrency or adverse currency exchange rates\nand may be characterized by a lack of\navailable currency hedging instruments. 16\nDisparities of wealth, the pace and success of\ndemocratization and ethnic, religious and\nracial disaffection, among other factors, may\nexacerbate social unrest, violence and labor\nunrest in some of the countries in which the\nFund may invest. Unanticipated or sudden\npolitical or social developments may result in\nsudden and significant investment losses.\nCompanies in many emerging markets are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries, and as a result, information about\nthe securities in which the Funds invest may\nbe less reliable or complete. Moreover,\nemerging markets often have less reliable\nsecurities valuations and greater risks\nassociated with custody of securities than\ndeveloped markets. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and shareholders may have limited\nlegal remedies. The Fund does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. In addition, emerging markets\noften have greater risk of capital controls\nthrough such measures as taxes or interest\nrate control than developed markets. Certain\nemerging market countries may also lack the\ninfrastructure necessary to attract large\namounts of foreign trade and investment.\nChronic structural public sector deficits in\nsome countries in which the Fund may invest\nmay adversely impact securities held by the\nFund. Local securities markets in emerging\nmarket countries may trade a small number of\nsecurities and may be unable to respond\neffectively to changes in trading volume,\npotentially making prompt liquidation of\nholdings difficult or impossible at times.\nSettlement procedures in emerging market\ncountries are frequently less developed and\nreliable than those in the U.S. (and other\ndeveloped countries). In addition, significant\ndelays may occur in certain markets in\nregistering the transfer of securities.\nSettlement or registration problems may make\nit more difficult for the Fund to value its\nportfolio securities and could have an adverse\neffect on the Fund in seeking to achieve its\ninvestment objective. There could be\nadditional impacts on the value of the Fund as\na result of sustainability risks, in\nparticular those caused by environmental\nchanges related to climate change, social\nissues (including relating to labor rights)\nand governance risk (including but not limited\nto risks around board independence, ownership\nand control, or audit and tax management).\nAdditionally, disclosures or third-party data\ncoverage associated with sustainability risks\nis generally less available or transparent in\nthese markets. Investing in emerging market\ncountries involves a higher risk of loss due\nto expropriation, nationalization,\nconfiscation of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on foreign\ninvestments and on repatriation of capital\ninvested in certain emerging market countries.\nAs a result, investments in certain countries\nin which the Fund may invest may be subject to\nloss due to expropriation or nationalization\nof assets and property or the imposition of\nrestrictions on foreign investments and\nrepatriation of capital. Risk of Investing in\nEurope. A Fund may be more exposed to the\neconomic and political risks of Europe and of\nthe European countries in which it invests\nthan are funds whose investments are more\ngeographically diversified. Adverse economic\nand political events in Europe may cause the\nFund\u2019s investments to decline in value. The\neconomies and markets of European countries\nare often closely connected and\ninterdependent, and events in one country in\nEurope can have an adverse impact on other\nEuropean countries. A Fund makes investments\nin securities of issuers that are domiciled\nin, have significant operations in, or that\nare listed on at least one securities exchange\nwithin member states of the EU. The EU\nrequires compliance by member states with\nrestrictions on inflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates and debt levels, as well as\nfiscal and monetary controls, each of which\nmay significantly affect every country in\nEurope, including those countries that are not\nmembers of the EU. Changes in imports or\nexports, changes in governmental or EU\nregulations on trade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro (the common currency of\ncertain EU countries), the default or threat\nof default by an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt, or an economic recession in an\nEU member state may have a significant adverse\neffect on the economies of other EU member\nstates and their trading partners. The\nEuropean financial markets have experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends in years past\ndue to concerns about economic downturns or\nrising government debt levels in several\nEuropean countries, including, but not limited\nto, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.\nThese events have and may in the future\nadversely affect the exchange rate of the euro\nand may significantly affect other European\ncountries. Responses to financial problems by\nEuropean governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the desired results,\nmay result in social unrest, may limit future\ngrowth and economic recovery or may have other\nunintended consequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and other\nentities of their debt could have additional\nadverse effects on economies, financial\nmarkets and asset valuations around the world.\nIn addition, one or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the EU. Certain\nEuropean countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect European issuers\nthat rely on the U.S. for trade. Secessionist\nmovements, such as the Catalan movement in\nSpain and the independence movement in\nScotland, as well as governmental or other\nresponses to such movements, may also create\ninstability and uncertainty in the region. In\naddition, the national politics of countries\nin the EU have been unpredictable and subject\nto influence by varying political groups and\nideologies. The governments of EU countries\nmay be subject to change and such countries\nmay experience social and political unrest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe also\ncould impact financial markets. The impact of\nthese events is not clear but could be\nsignificant and far-reaching and could\nadversely affect the value of a Fund. A Fund\u2019s\ninvestments could be negatively impacted by\nany economic or political instability in any\nEuropean country. 17 Risk of Investing in\nJapan. Investing in Japanese issuers subjects\na Fund to legal, regulatory, political,\neconomic, currency, geographic and security\nrisks that are specific to Japan. Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth rate has generally remained\nlow relative to other advanced economies, and\nit may continue to remain low. Its economy\ndepends heavily on international trade and\ngovernment policy supporting its export\nmarket. Economic downturns or political\ninstability in its key trading partners, which\ninclude the United States and China, could\nhave an adverse effect on the Japanese\neconomy. Currency fluctuations also could\nadversely impact Japan\u2019s export market and its\neconomy. If the Japanese government were to\nintervene in the currency market, as it has in\nthe past, the yen\u2019s value could fluctuate\nsharply and unpredictably, which could cause\nlosses to investors. Other risks to Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth and competitiveness include\nsignificant public debt and deficits as well\nas labor shortages due to an aging and\ndeclining population. In addition, Japan lacks\nmany natural resources and relies heavily on\nimports of oil and other commodities. Price\nincreases, shortages or volatility in\ncommodities markets could have a negative\neffect on Japan\u2019s economy. Other risks to the\nJapanese economy and financial markets include\nnatural disasters and Japan\u2019s relations with\nneighboring countries, which at times have\nbeen strained. Risk of Investing in Russia.\nInvesting in Russian securities involves\nsignificant risks, in addition to those\ndescribed under \u201c Risk of Investing in\nEmerging Markets \u201d and \u201c Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk, \u201d that are not typically associated with\ninvesting in U.S. securities, including: \u25a0 The\nrisk of delays in settling portfolio\ntransactions and the risk of loss arising out\nof the system of share registration and\ncustody used in Russia; \u25a0 Risks in connection\nwith the maintenance of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities and cash with foreign sub-\ncustodians and securities depositories,\nincluding the risk that appropriate sub-\ncustody arrangements will not be available to\na Fund; \u25a0 The risk that a Fund\u2019s ownership\nrights in portfolio securities could be lost\nthrough fraud or negligence because ownership\nin shares of Russian companies is recorded by\nthe companies themselves and by registrars,\nrather than by a central registration system;\n\u25a0 The risk that a Fund may not be able to\npursue claims on behalf of its shareholders\nbecause of the system of share registration\nand custody, and because Russian banking\ninstitutions and registrars are not guaranteed\nby the Russian government; and \u25a0 The risk that\nvarious responses by other nation-states to\nalleged Russian cyber activity will impact\nRussia\u2019s economy and Russian issuers of\nsecurities in which a Fund invests. Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine . Russia launched a large-\nscale invasion of Ukraine on February 24,\n2022. The extent and duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and resulting\nfuture market disruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the value of the\nruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible\nto predict, but could be significant.\nDisruptions caused by Russian military action\nor other actions (including cyberattacks and\nespionage) or resulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity, including\npurchasing and financing restrictions,\nboycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser\npreferences, sanctions, import and export\nrestrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian companies or\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nmay impact Russia\u2019s economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which a Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Russia Sanctions. Governments,\nincluding the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., and\nmany other countries (collectively, the \u201c\nSanctioning Bodies \u201d ) have imposed economic\nsanctions on certain Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, and Russian corporate\nand banking entities, including banning Russia\nfrom global payments systems that facilitate\ncross-border payments. In an effort to curtail\nRussia\u2019s ability to finance its war effort,\nthe Sanctioning Bodies continue to elevate\nthese measures and may, going forward,\ninstitute broader sanctions on Russia. These\nsanctions, or even the threat of further\nsanctions, may result in the decline of the\nvalue and liquidity of Russian securities, a\nweakening of the ruble or other adverse\nconsequences to the Russian economy. These\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Russian securities and/or funds\ninvested in prohibited assets, impairing the\nability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or\ndeliver those securities and/or assets. The\nsanctions against certain Russian issuers\ninclude broad asset freezes and prohibitions\non transacting or otherwise dealing in select\nissuances of debt or equity of such issuers,\namong others. Compliance with each of these\nsanctions measures has impaired, and may\ncontinue to impair, the ability of a Fund to\nbuy, sell, hold, receive or deliver the\naffected securities or other securities of\nsuch issuers. A Fund may also be legally\nrequired to block (i.e., freeze) assets in a\nblocked account and report the accompanying\nexposure to Sanctioning Bodies. Sanctions have\nresulted in Russia taking counter measures or\nretaliatory actions, which has impaired the\nvalue and liquidity of Russian securities.\nThese retaliatory measures include the\nimmediate freeze of Russian assets held by a\nFund. Due to the freeze of these assets,\nincluding depositary receipts, a Fund may need\nto liquidate non-restricted assets in order to\nsatisfy any Fund redemption orders. The\nliquidation of Fund assets during this time\nmay also result in the Fund receiving\nsubstantially lower prices for its securities.\nRussia may implement additional retaliatory\nmeasures, which may further impair the value\nand liquidity of Russian securities and the\nability of a Fund to receive dividend\npayments. Russia has issued a number of\ncountersanctions, some of which restrict the\ndistribution of profits by limited liability\ncompanies (e.g., dividends), and prohibits\nRussian persons from entering into\ntransactions with designated persons from \u201c\nunfriendly states \u201d as well as the export of\nraw materials or other products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons. Russian companies\nmay be unable to pay dividends and, if they\npay dividends, a Fund may be unable to receive\nthem. These sanctions, the decision by Russia\nto suspend trading on the Moscow Exchange\n(MOEX) and prohibit non-resident investors\nfrom executing security sales, and other\nevents have led index providers to remove\nRussian securities from indexes. Each Fund is\ncurrently restricted from trading in Russian\nsecurities, including those in its portfolio\n(if any), and the Underlying Indexes have\nremoved Russian 18 securities (if any). This\ndisparity will also lead to increased tracking\nerror. The inability of a Fund to trade in\nRussian securities may adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s ability to meet its investment\nobjective. It is unknown when, or if,\nsanctions may be lifted or a Fund\u2019s ability to\ntrade in Russian securities will resume. Risk\nof Investing in Saudi Arabia. Investing in\nSaudi Arabian issuers involves legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to Saudi\nArabia. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on\nincome from the sale of petroleum and trade\nwith other countries involved in the sale of\npetroleum, and its economy is therefore\nvulnerable to changes in foreign currency\nvalues and the petroleum market. A sustained\ndecrease in petroleum prices could have a\nnegative impact on all aspects of the economy.\nIn addition, Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy relies\nheavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes\nin the availability of this labor supply could\nhave an adverse effect on the economy.\nInvestments in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers involve risks not typically associated\nwith investments in securities of issuers in\nmore developed countries, which may negatively\naffect the value of a Fund\u2019s investments. Such\nheightened risks may include, among others,\nthe expropriation and/or nationalization of\nassets, restrictions on and government\nintervention in international trade,\nconfiscatory taxation, political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision-making,\narmed conflict, crime and instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. The government of Saudi\nArabia exercises substantial influence over\nmany aspects of the private sector, and its\nactions could significantly impact the value\nof Saudi Arabian securities. Although some\neconomic reforms ( e.g., privatization) are\nunderway, restrictions on foreign ownership\npersist, and the government has an ownership\nstake in many key industries. Saudi Arabia has\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Economic sanctions (or the threat of\nthem) on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi\nArabian corporate entities may have an adverse\nimpact on the Saudi Arabian economy and\nsecurities. The ability of foreign investors\nto invest in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership of such securities. In\naddition, the Saudi Arabian government places\ninvestment limitations on the ownership of\nSaudi Arabian issuers by foreign investors.\nSuch limits may prevent a Fund from investing\nin accordance with its strategy and result in\ntracking error for a Fund that tracks an\nindex. Saudi Arabia Broker Risk.There are a\nnumber of ways to conduct transactions in\nequity securities in the Saudi Arabian market.\nA Fund generally expects to transact in a\nmanner so that it is not limited by Saudi\nArabian regulations to a single broker.\nHowever, there may be a limited number of\nbrokers who can provide services to a Fund,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the\nprices, quantity or timing of Fund\ntransactions. A limited number of brokers may\nimpact a Fund\u2019s ability to achieve best\nexecution on transactions. In addition, a Fund\nmay be more susceptible to credit loss or\ntrading disruptions in the event of a default\nor business disruption among the available\nbrokers. If a Fund\u2019s use of a broker is\ndisrupted, there could be an adverse impact on\nthe Fund\u2019s operations and, if applicable, its\nability to track the Underlying Index, and the\nFund\u2019s shares could trade at a premium or\ndiscount to NAV. A Fund may also incur losses\ndue to the acts or omissions of its brokers in\nthe execution or settlement of transactions or\nin the transfer of funds or securities. Risk\nof Investing in the U.K. Investing in U.K.\nissuers subjects a Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, economic, currency, geographic and\nsecurity risks that are specific to the U.K.\nEconomic downturns or political instability in\nits key trading partners, which include the\nUnited States and other European countries,\ncould have an adverse effect on the U.K.\neconomy. Following Brexit, certain trading\nmatters between the U.K. and the EU remain\nunresolved, including with respect to\nfinancial services. Continuing uncertainty\nregarding the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU\ncould have an adverse impact on the economy\nand currency of the United Kingdom. Other\nrisks to the U.K.\u2019s economic growth and\ncompetitiveness include high public debt and\nrelatively low productivity. Risk of Investing\nin the U.S. Investing in U.S. issuers involves\nlegal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that are specific\nto the U.S. A decrease in imports or exports,\nchanges in trade regulations, inflation, an\neconomic recession, financial system stress,\nor political turmoil, among other risks, may\nhave an adverse effect on the U.S. economy and\nthe securities listed on U.S. exchanges. The\nU.S. is also subject to the risk of natural\ndisasters, such as droughts, earthquakes,\nfires and floods. U.S. security risks include\nacts of terrorism, internal unrest and a\ndeterioration in relations between the U.S.\nand certain countries. Any of these may\nadversely affect the U.S. economy, financial\nmarkets or issuers. 19 Governmental agencies\nproject that the U.S. will maintain elevated\npublic debt levels for the foreseeable future.\nAlthough elevated debt levels do not\nnecessarily indicate or cause economic\nproblems, the costs of servicing such debt may\nconstrain future economic growth.\nCircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal on\nU.S. government debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. U.S. Economic Risk.\nThe U.S. is a significant trading partner of,\nor foreign investor in, a number of countries.\nAs a result, the economic conditions of such\ncountries may be particularly affected by\nchanges in the U.S. economy, such as a\ndecrease in U.S. imports or exports, changes\nin trade regulations, changes in the U.S.\ndollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown\nin the U.S. Any such event may have an adverse\neffect on the economies of U.S. trading\npartners and the securities issuers in such\ncountries, which in turn could negatively\nimpact a Fund\u2019s investments. Circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent the timely\npayment of interest or principal on U.S.\ngovernment debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. Securities Lending\nRisk. A Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that a\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. A\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for a Fund. Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Investments in\nsmall-capitalization companies may be riskier,\nless liquid, more volatile and more\nsusceptible to economic, market and industry\nchanges than investments in large- or mid-\ncapitalization companies. Small-capitalization\ncompanies may have more limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, personnel and\nmanagement experience. As a result, they\ngenerally are more vulnerable than larger\ncompanies to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Small-capitalization companies\nmay have a short business track record, with\nrelatively less information available to\ninvestors. The securities of smaller companies\nmay trade less frequently and in lower volumes\nthan the securities of larger companies. Some\nsecurities of smaller issuers may be illiquid\nor restricted as to resale, and their values\nmay have significant volatility. A Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such\nsecurities at any time, or at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet the Fund\u2019s\nobligations. Style Factors Risk. The\napplicable style factors for a Fund based on\nits Underlying Index have characteristics that\nmay cause the Fund to underperform the\napplicable Parent Index or the market as a\nwhole. There may be periods when a particular\nstyle of equity investing is out of favor, and\nthe investment performance of a Fund may\nsuffer during such a period. Momentum Factor\nRisk . Securities that previously exhibited\ngreater momentum characteristics than other\nsecurities may not continue to experience\npositive momentum, and such a change could\noccur quickly. Momentum securities may\nexperience more volatility than the market as\na whole. Quality Factor Risk . Securities that\npreviously exhibited greater quality\ncharacteristics than other securities may not\ncontinue to be quality securities. Many\nfactors can impact a security\u2019s quality and\nperformance, and such factors and their impact\nmay be difficult to predict. Value Factor Risk\n. Value securities may decline in price or\nfail to appreciate for long periods of time,\nand they may never realize their full\npotential value. Although value securities\nhave generally performed better than non-value\nsecurities during periods of economic\nrecovery, there is no assurance that they will\ncontinue to do so. Low Volatility Factor Risk\n. Low volatility securities may underperform\nthe broader market during periods of strong,\nrising or speculative stock prices. The prices\nof such securities may not be any less\nvolatile (and could be more volatile) than the\nmarket as a whole. Low Size Factor Risk . Low\nsize companies may have more limited product\nlines, markets, financial resources, personnel\nand management experience and thus may be more\nvulnerable to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments than relatively larger-\ncapitalized companies. Low size securities may\nbe more be more volatile and less liquid than\nsecurities on the larger end of a Fund\u2019s\ncapitalization range, and it may be more\ndifficult for a Fund to buy and sell them.\nSustainability Risk. Sustainability risk is an\ninclusive term to designate investment risk\n(probability or uncertainty of occurrence of\nmaterial losses relative to the expected\nreturn of an investment) that relates to\nenvironmental, social or governance issues.\nSustainability risk around environmental\nissues includes, but is not limited to,\nclimate risk, both physical and transition\nrisk. Physical risk arises from the physical\neffects of climate change, acute or chronic.\nFor example, frequent and severe climate-\nrelated events can impact products and\nservices and supply chains. Transition risk \u2013\nwhether policy, technology, market or\nreputation risk \u2013 arises from the adjustment\nto a low-carbon economy in order to mitigate\nclimate change. Risks related to social issues\ncan include, but are not limited to, labor\nrights and community relations. Governance-\nrelated risks can include but are not limited\nto risks around board independence, ownership\nand control, and audit and tax management.\nThese risks can impact an issuer\u2019s operational\neffectiveness and resilience as well as its\npublic perception and reputation, affecting\nits profitability and, in turn, its capital\ngrowth and ultimately impacting the value of\nholdings in a Fund. These are only examples of\nsustainability risk factors, and\nsustainability risk factors do not solely\ndetermine the risk profile of the investment.\nThe relevance, severity, materiality and time\nhorizon of sustainability risk factors and\nother risks can differ significantly across\nFunds. 20 Sustainability risk can manifest\nitself through different existing risk types\nincluding, but not limited to, market,\nliquidity, concentration, credit and asset-\nliability mismatch risk. For example, a Fund\nmay invest in the securities of an issuer that\ncould face potentially reduced revenues or\nincreased expenditures from physical climate\nrisk ( e.g ., decreased production capacity\ndue to supply chain perturbations, lower sales\ndue to demand shocks or higher operating or\ncapital costs) or transition risk ( e.g .,\ndecreased demand for carbon-intensive products\nand services or increased production costs due\nto changing input prices). As a result,\nsustainability risk factors may have a\nmaterial impact on an investment, may increase\nvolatility, may affect liquidity and may have\nan adverse impact on the value of shares of a\nFund. The impact of those risks may be higher\nfor Funds with particular sectoral or\ngeographic concentrations. For example, Funds\nwith geographic concentration in locations\nsusceptible to adverse weather conditions\nwhere the value of the investments in the\nFunds may be more susceptible to adverse\nphysical climate events, or Funds with\nspecific sectoral concentrations, such as\ninvesting in industries or issuers with high\ncarbon intensity or high switching costs\nassociated with the transition to low carbon\nalternatives, may be more impacted by climate\ntransition risks. All or a combination of\nthese factors may have an unpredictable impact\non a Fund\u2019s investments. Under normal market\nconditions, such events could have a material\nimpact on the value of shares of a Fund.\nAssessments of sustainability risk are\nspecific to the asset class and to a fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Different asset classes\nrequire different data and tools to apply\nheightened scrutiny, assess materiality, and\nmake meaningful differentiation among issuers\nand assets. To the extent consistent with a\nFund\u2019s investment objective, risks are\nconsidered and risk managed concurrently, by\nprioritizing in part based on materiality and\non the Fund\u2019s objective. The impacts of\nsustainability risk are likely to develop over\ntime, and new sustainability risks may be\nidentified as further data and information\nregarding sustainability factors and impacts\nbecome available. Technology Companies Risk.\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources and personnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence as well as\nunexpected risks and costs related to new\nproduct introduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies may\nbe adversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs.\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk. If certain\naggregate and/or fund-level ownership\nthresholds are reached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates or a Fund,\nor as a result of third-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or regulator, the ability\nof BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients\n(including a Fund) to purchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or undertake\nbusiness transactions may be restricted by\nregulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity\nof a Fund to invest in certain securities or\nother assets may be affected by the relevant\nthreshold limits, and such limitations may\nhave adverse effects on the liquidity and\nperformance of a Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings. To\nthe extent a Fund tracks an index, such limits\nmay increase the risk of the Fund being\nunderinvested in an asset relative to its\nUnderlying Index and increase the risk of\ntracking error. For example, ownership limits\nmay apply to securities whose issuers operate\nin certain regulated industries or in certain\ninternational markets. Such limits also may\napply where the investing entity (such as a\nFund) is subject to corporate or regulatory\nownership restrictions or invests in certain\nfutures or other derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel amounts invested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including a Fund) may not\nexceed the relevant limits without the grant\nof a license or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent. In other cases, exceeding such\nthresholds may cause BFA and its affiliates, a\nFund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions.\nTracking Error Risk. A Fund that tracks an\nindex is subject to the risk of \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of a Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by a Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; a Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by a Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for a Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index, such\nas during a rebalancing or reconstitution; and\nimpacts to a Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. A Fund that\ntracks an index composed of a large number of\nsecurities or other assets may experience\ngreater tracking error than a Fund that tracks\na more narrow index. Tracking error risk may\nbe heightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nUtility Companies Risk. Utility infrastructure\noften requires significant capital\nexpenditures, and utility companies may face\nhigh interest costs and difficulty in raising\ncapital. Technological innovations may render\nexisting equipment or products obsolete, and\ncompanies may experience difficulty in\nobtaining regulatory approval of new\ntechnologies. Utility operations may be\ndisrupted by events that target or damage\nutility infrastructure, including natural\ndisasters and cyber or other attacks.\nUtilities companies may be adversely affected\nby volatility in the price of certain energy\nresources. 21 Utility companies face risks\nfrom government regulation and oversight as\nwell as from deregulation (if applicable).\nRegulators may monitor and control companies\u2019\nrevenues and costs. There is no assurance that\nregulators will grant rate increases or that\nrate levels will be adequate to permit the\npayment of stock dividends or bond coupon\npayments. In addition, there may be regulatory\nrestrictions on the ability of utility\ncompanies to enter new lines of business and\ngeographic areas. Utility companies incur\ncosts in complying with environmental and\nother regulations and may face significant\nchallenges in obtaining regulatory approval\nfor certain projects, such as nuclear power\nplants. Utility companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. Energy conservation, climate\nchange and other sustainability policies also\nmay impact utility companies. Deregulation may\nsubject companies to greater competition, may\nadversely affect their profitability and may\nlead them to engage in riskier ventures.\nValuation Risk. The price that a Fund could\nreceive upon the sale (or other disposition)\nof a security or other asset may differ from\nthe Fund\u2019s valuation of the security or other\nasset, particularly for securities or other\nassets that trade in low volume or volatile\nmarkets or that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by a Fund also\nmay differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index (if applicable). Because\nnon-U.S. exchanges or markets may be open on\ndays or during time periods when a Fund does\nnot price its shares, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. In addition, for\npurposes of calculating a Fund's NAV, the\nvalue of assets denominated in non-U.S.\ncurrencies (if any) is translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. For a\nFund that tracks an Underlying Index, this may\nresult in a difference between the prices used\nto calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices\nused by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,\ncould result in a difference between the\nFund's performance and the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Authorized Participants that\ncreate or redeem Fund shares on days when a\nFund is holding fair-valued securities or\nother assets may receive fewer or more shares,\nor lower or higher redemption proceeds, than\nthey would have received had the securities or\nother assets not been fair valued or been\nvalued using a different methodology. The\nability to value investments may be impacted\nby technological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. Value Securities Risk. Value\nsecurities are those issued by companies that\nmay be perceived as undervalued. Such\nsecurities may decline in price or fail to\nappreciate for long periods of time, and they\nmay never realize their full potential value\nbecause the market fails to recognize the\nstock\u2019s intrinsic worth. Value securities may\nunderperform growth securities and other types\nof assets as well as the overall stock market.\nAlthough value securities have generally\nperformed better than non-value securities\nduring periods of economic recovery, there is\nno assurance that they will continue to do so.\nValue securities may go in and out of favor\nover time, which could affect the performance\nof a Fund with such holdings. Portfolio\nHoldings Information A description of the\npolicies and procedures with respect to the\ndisclosure of the Funds\u2019 portfolio securities\nand other assets (as applicable) is available\nin the applicable Statement of Additional\nInformation ( \u201c SAI \u201d ).

Management of the Funds\nInvestment Adviser As investment adviser, BFA\nhas overall responsibility for the general\nmanagement and administration of the Funds.\nBFA provides an investment program for the\nFunds and manages the investment of the Funds\u2019\nassets. In seeking to achieve the Funds\u2019\nrespective investment objectives, BFA uses\nteams of portfolio managers, investment\nstrategists and other investment specialists\nand may draw upon the trading, research and\nexpertise of its affiliates. This team\napproach brings together many disciplines and\nleverages BFA\u2019s extensive resources. BFA is an\nindirect wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ) and is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, BFA and its affiliates\nprovided investment advisory services for\nassets of approximately $11.5 trillion. From\ntime to time, an employee of BlackRock may\nexpress views regarding a particular security\nor other instrument, asset class, company,\nindustry, or market sector. Such views are the\nviews of only that individual as of the time\nexpressed. They do not necessarily represent\nthe views of BlackRock or any other person\nwithin the BlackRock organization. Such views\nmay change at any time based upon market or\nother conditions, and BlackRock has no\nresponsibility to update such views. You\nshould not rely on any such views as\ninvestment advice or as an indication of\ntrading intent on behalf of a Fund. Fees and\nExpenses Pursuant to the Investment Advisory\nAgreement between BFA and the Trust (entered\ninto on behalf of the Funds), BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\neach Fund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses and any\nextraordinary expenses (as determined by a\nmajority of the Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the Trust). Operating\nexpenses paid by BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude Acquired Fund Fees\nand Expenses, if any. 22\n\nA discussion regarding the basis for the\napproval by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the\n\u201c Board \u201d ) of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement with BFA is available in the Funds'\nForm N-CSR filed with the SEC for the period\nended July 31 and in the applicable financial\nstatements posted at www.iShares.com. For its\ninvestment advisory services to each Fund, for\nthe fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, BFA was\npaid a management fee from each Fund, as a\npercentage of the Fund\u2019s average daily net\nassets, net of any applicable waivers, at the\nannual rate set forth in the table below. If\nBFA has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fees for a Fund, the\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nits expiration date only upon written\nagreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition,\nBFA may from time to time voluntarily waive\nand/or reimburse fees or expenses to reduce a\nFund\u2019s total annual fund operating expenses\n(excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if\nany). Any such voluntary waiver or\nreimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime.\n                                              \n  Fund                        Management Fee  \n  iShares China Large-Cap     0.74%1          \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Global Equity       0.20%2          \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares International       0.15%           \n  Equity Factor ETF                           \n  iShares International                       \n  Small-Cap Equity Factor     0.23%           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI EAFE Growth    0.35%1          \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI EAFE Min Vol   0.20%1          \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI EAFE           0.40%1          \n  Small-Cap ETF                               \n  iShares MSCI EAFE Value     0.33%1          \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI Europe         0.40%           \n  Small-Cap ETF                               \n  iShares MSCI Intl Momentum  0.30%           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI Intl Quality   0.30%           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI Intl Value     0.30%           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n                                              \n1 The management fee schedule for the Fund,\nincluding its breakpoint pricing arrangements,\nis described in the Fund\u2019s Statement of\nAdditional Information. 2 BFA has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fees in an amount equal to the\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any,\nattributable to investments by the Fund in\nother series of the Trust and iShares, Inc.\nuntil November 30, 2025.

BFA and its Affiliates are\ninvolved worldwide with a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset management\nactivities and in the ordinary course of\nbusiness may engage in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests of other\nclients may conflict with those of a Fund. BFA\nand its Affiliates act, or may act, as an\ninvestor, research provider, investment\nmanager, commodity pool operator, commodity\ntrading advisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent\nand/or principal. BFA and its Affiliates may\nhave other direct and indirect interests in\nsecurities, currencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other assets in which a Fund\nmay directly or indirectly invest. BFA and its\nAffiliates may engage in proprietary trading\nand advise accounts and other funds that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in and compete for\ntransactions in the same or similar types of\nsecurities, currencies and other assets as are\nheld by a Fund. This may include transactions\nin securities issued by other open-end and\nclosed-end investment companies, including\ninvestment companies that are affiliated with\nthe Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). The trading\nactivities of BFA and its Affiliates are\ncarried out without reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by a Fund. These\nactivities may result in BFA or an Affiliate\nhaving positions in assets that are senior or\njunior to, or that have interests different\nfrom or adverse to, the assets held by a Fund.\nA Fund may invest in securities issued by, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nwith which an Affiliate has significant debt\nor equity investments or other interests. A\nFund may also invest in issuances (such as\ndebt offerings or structured notes) for which\nan Affiliate is compensated for providing\nadvisory, cash management or other services. A\nFund also may invest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nfor which an Affiliate provides or may provide\nresearch coverage or other analysis. An\nAffiliate may have business relationships\nwith, and receive compensation from,\ndistributors, consultants or others who\nrecommend a Fund or who engage in transactions\nwith or for a Fund. Neither BlackRock nor any\nAffiliate is under any obligation to share any\ninvestment opportunity, idea or strategy with\na Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete\nwith a Fund for appropriate investment\nopportunities. The results of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of other\naccounts managed by an Affiliate. It is\npossible that a Fund could sustain losses\nduring periods in which one or more Affiliates\nand other accounts achieve profits on their\ntrading for proprietary or other accounts. The\nopposite result is also possible. In addition,\na Fund may enter into transactions in which\nBFA or an Affiliate or their directors,\nofficers, employees or clients have an adverse\ninterest. A Fund may be adversely impacted by\nthe effects of transactions undertaken by BFA\nor an Affiliate or their directors, officers,\nemployees or clients. From time to time,\nBlackRock or its advisory clients (including\nother funds and accounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, purchase and\nhold shares of a Fund. The price,\navailability, liquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by BlackRock\nor its advisory clients. A Fund\u2019s activities\nmay be limited because of regulatory\nrestrictions applicable to BFA or an Affiliate\nor their policies designed to comply with such\nrestrictions. Under a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board, the Funds have\nretained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as\ntheir securities lending agent to the extent\nthat they participate in the securities\nlending program. For these services, the\nsecurities lending agent will receive a fee\nfrom the participating Fund based on the\nreturns earned on the Fund\u2019s lending\nactivities, including investment of the cash\nreceived as collateral for the loaned\nsecurities. In addition, one or more\nAffiliates may be among the entities to which\na Fund may lend its portfolio securities under\nthe securities lending program.\n\n24\n\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement, certain Funds\nhave retained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the\n\u201c Distributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an Affiliate of\nBFA, to perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d )\non the design and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may have, or from\ntime to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its Affiliates. BlackRock and its\nAffiliates may benefit from a Fund using a\nBlackRock index by creating increasing\nacceptance in the marketplace for such\nindexes. BlackRock and its Affiliates are not\nobligated to license an index to a Fund, and\nno Fund is under an obligation to use a\nBlackRock index. The terms of a Fund\u2019s index\nlicensing agreement with BlackRock or its\nAffiliates may not be as favorable as the\nterms offered to other licensees. The\nactivities of BFA and its Affiliates and their\nrespective directors, officers or employees\nmay give rise to other conflicts of interest\nthat could disadvantage a Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to address these potential\nconflicts of interest. Please see the SAI for\nfurther information. Shareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder information, including\nhow to buy and sell shares of the Funds, is\navailable free of charge by calling toll-free\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting\nwww.iShares.com. Buying and Selling Shares\nTransactions in shares of the Funds occur in\nthe primary market and the secondary market.\nPrimary market transactions, known as \u201c\ncreations \u201d and \u201c redemptions, \u201d occur only\nbetween the Funds and Authorized Participants\n( i.e ., financial institutions that are\nauthorized to participate in such\ntransactions), as described in the Creations\nand Redemptions section below. Fund shares are\nlisted on U.S. national securities exchanges,\nwhere they can be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day at market prices, like shares\nof other publicly traded companies. A Fund\u2019s\nshares may also be available in other\nsecondary markets, such as on non-U.S.\nexchanges and through funds or structured\ninvestment vehicles similar to depositary\nreceipts. The Funds do not impose any minimum\ninvestment for Fund shares purchased on an\nexchange or otherwise in the secondary market.\nBuying or selling Fund shares on an exchange\nor other secondary market generally involves\ntwo types of costs that are common in\nsecurities transactions. First, when buying or\nselling Fund shares through a broker, you may\nincur a brokerage commission and other\ncharges. The commission is frequently a fixed\namount; it may be a significant proportional\ncost if you are seeking to buy or sell small\namounts of shares. Second, you may incur the\ncost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is any\ndifference between the bid price and the ask\nprice for the shares. The spread varies over\ntime based on a Fund\u2019s trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. Generally, the spread is\nsmaller if a Fund has high trading volume and\nmarket liquidity, and larger if a Fund has\nlower trading volume and market liquidity. The\nlatter is often the case for newly launched or\nsmaller funds. A Fund\u2019s spread may also be\nimpacted by the liquidity (or lack thereof) of\nthe underlying securities or other assets held\nby the Fund, particularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds, or by instances of\nsignificant volatility of the underlying\nassets. The U.S. national securities exchanges\nthat list Fund shares are open for trading\nMonday through Friday and are closed on\nweekends and the following holidays (or the\ndays on which they are observed): New Year\u2019s\nDay, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents\u2019\nDay, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day\nand Christmas Day. Investments in Investment\nCompanies Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments by investment\ncompanies, including foreign and unregistered\ninvestment companies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For example, a\nregistered investment company (the \u201c Acquired\nFund \u201d ), such as the Funds, may not knowingly\nsell or otherwise dispose of any security\nissued by the Acquired Fund to any investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquiring Fund \u201d ) or any\ncompany or companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale\nor disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company\nor companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund,\nor (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and other investment\ncompanies and companies controlled by them.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, registered\ninvestment companies are permitted to invest\nin a Fund beyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions set forth in Rule 12d1-4 under the\n1940 Act. To make such an investment in an\nAcquired Fund, a registered investment company\nmust, among other things, enter into an\nagreement with the Trust. If an Acquired Fund\ninvests significantly in other registered\ninvestment companies in reliance on Rule\n12d1-4, an Acquiring Fund will not be\npermitted to rely on Rule 12d1-4 and invest in\nthe Fund beyond the Section 12(d)(1) limits.\nAny investment company interested in\npurchasing shares of a Fund beyond the limits\nset forth in Section 12(d)(1) should contact\nBFA. Foreign investment companies are\npermitted to invest in a Fund only up to the\nlimits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject\nto any applicable SEC no-action relief. 25\nBook Entry Shares of the Funds are held in\nbook-entry form, which means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The Depository Trust\nCompany ( \u201c DTC \u201d ), which serves as the\nsecurities depository for shares of the Funds,\nor its nominee is the record owner of, and\nholds legal title to, all outstanding shares\nof the Funds. Investors owning Fund shares are\nbeneficial owners as shown on the records of\nDTC or its participants. DTC participants\ninclude securities brokers and dealers, banks,\ntrust companies, clearing corporations and\nother institutions that directly or indirectly\nmaintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As\na beneficial owner of Fund shares, you are not\nentitled to receive physical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares registered in\nyour name, and you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares. Therefore, to\nexercise any right as an owner of Fund shares,\nyou must rely upon the procedures of DTC and\nits participants. These procedures are the\nsame as those that apply to any other\nsecurities held in book-entry or \u201c street name\n\u201d form. Share Prices The trading prices of a\nFund\u2019s shares in the secondary market\ngenerally differ from the Fund\u2019s daily NAV and\nare affected by various factors, such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF shares and the\nsecurities or other assets held by a Fund as\nwell as other market and economic conditions.\nDetermination of Net Asset Value The NAV of a\nFund normally is determined once daily Monday\nthrough Friday, on each day that the New York\nStock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) is open for\ntrading. The NAV generally is determined as of\nthe close of the NYSE\u2019s regular trading hours,\nnormally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, based on\nprices at the time of closing. Any Fund assets\nor liabilities that are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing\nmarket rates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data service providers.\nThe NAV of a Fund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s net assets ( i.e .,\nthe value of its total assets, including the\nvalue of any underlying fund shares in which\nthe Fund invests, less total liabilities) by\nthe total number of outstanding shares of the\nFund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.\nThe value of a Fund\u2019s assets and liabilities\nis determined pursuant to BFA\u2019s valuation\npolicies and procedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the valuation\ndesignee for each Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5\nunder the Investment Company Act. Equity\nsecurities and other equity instruments for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at market value, which is generally\ndetermined using the last reported official\nclosing price or, if a reported closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on the\nexchange or market on which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at the time of\nvaluation. Shares of underlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds) that are not\ntraded on an exchange are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying ETFs and closed-\nend funds that trade on exchanges are valued\nat their most recent market closing price.\nFixed-income securities are valued using last\navailable bid prices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or prices\n(including evaluated prices) supplied by the\nFunds\u2019 approved independent third-party\npricing services, each in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s valuation policies and procedures.\nPricing services may use matrix pricing or\nvaluation models that utilize certain inputs\nand assumptions to derive values. Pricing\nservices generally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly transactions of an\ninstitutional round lot size, but a Fund may\nhold or transact in such securities in smaller\nodd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower\nprices than institutional round lots. An\namortized cost method of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations with 60 days\nor less remaining to maturity unless BFA\ndetermines in good faith that such method does\nnot represent fair value. Generally, trading\nin certain instruments ( e.g ., non-U.S.\nsecurities, money market instruments, etc.) is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of the NYSE\u2019s regular\ntrading hours. The values of such instruments\nused in computing a Fund\u2019s NAV are determined\nas of such times. For certain foreign assets,\na third-party vendor supplies evaluated,\nsystematic fair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-factor model\nafter the relevant foreign markets have\nclosed. This systematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to correlate the\nprices of foreign assets in one or more\nnon-U.S. markets following the close of the\nlocal markets to the prices that might have\nprevailed as of a Fund\u2019s pricing time.\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options may\nbe valued using a mathematical model that may\nincorporate a number of market data factors.\nWhen market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in accordance with its policies\nand procedures. Fair value represents a good\nfaith approximation of the value of an asset\nor liability. It is the amount that the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive from the\ncurrent sale of an asset or the cost to\nextinguish a liability in an arm\u2019s-length\ntransaction. BFA may conclude that a market\nquotation is not readily available or is\nunreliable if: \u25a0 An asset or liability does\nnot have a price source due to its lack of\ntrading or other reasons; 26 \u25a0 A market\nquotation differs significantly from recent\nprice quotations or otherwise no longer\nappears to reflect fair value; \u25a0 An asset or\nliability is thinly traded; \u25a0 There is a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation; or \u25a0 The trading\nmarket on which an instrument is listed is\nsuspended or closed and no appropriate\nalternative trading market is available. A \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment prior to or at the time of pricing a\nFund\u2019s assets or liabilities, that the event\nis likely to cause a material change to the\nlast exchange closing price or closing market\nprice of one or more of the Fund\u2019s assets or\nliabilities. Valuing a Fund\u2019s investments\nusing fair value pricing may result in prices\nthat differ from current market valuations and\nthat may not be the prices at which those\ninvestments could have been sold during the\nperiod for which the particular fair values\nwere used. For an index Fund, the use of both\nfair value prices and current market\nvaluations in a particular NAV calculation\ncould result in a difference between the\nprices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s NAV and the\nprices used by the Fund\u2019s underlying index.\nThis could, in turn, result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance and the\nperformance of its underlying index. Dividends\nand Distributions General Policies. A Fund\ngenerally declares and pays dividends from net\ninvestment income, if any, at least once a\nyear. Distributions of net realized securities\ngains, if any, generally are declared and paid\nonce a year, but the Trust may make\ndistributions on a more frequent basis for a\nFund. The Trust reserves the right to declare\nspecial distributions if, in its reasonable\ndiscretion, such action is necessary or\nadvisable to preserve its status as a\nregulated investment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) or to\navoid the imposition of income or excise taxes\non undistributed income or realized gains.\nDividends and other distributions on Fund\nshares are distributed on a pro rata basis to\nbeneficial owners of the shares. Dividend\npayments and other distributions are made\nthrough DTC participants and indirect\nparticipants to beneficial owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from the Funds.\nDividend Reinvestment Service. No dividend\nreinvestment service is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make the DTC book-entry\nDividend Reinvestment Program available to\nbeneficial owners of Fund shares for the\nreinvestment of distributions. Beneficial\nowners should contact their broker to\ndetermine the availability and costs of the\nservice and the details of participation.\nBrokers may require beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and timetables.\nIf the program is used, dividend distributions\nof both income and realized gains will be\nautomatically reinvested in additional whole\nFund shares purchased in the secondary market.\nNote on Tax Information. The following\nsections summarize some of the consequences\nunder current U.S. federal tax law of an\ninvestment in a Fund. This information is not\na substitute for personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and local taxation on\nFund distributions and sales of Fund shares.\nDistributions that are attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal government\nobligations may be exempt from certain state\nand local tax. Consult your personal tax\nadvisor about the potential tax consequences\nof an investment in Fund shares under all\napplicable tax laws. Taxes As with any\ninvestment, you should consider how your\ninvestment in shares of a Fund will be taxed,\nincluding possible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or when you sell Fund\nshares. The tax information in this Prospectus\nis provided as general information, based on\ncurrent law. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund. There is no\nguarantee that shares of a Fund will receive\ncertain regulatory or accounting treatment.\nTaxes on Fund Distributions Shareholders in a\nFund will receive information after the end of\neach calendar year setting forth the amount of\ndividends and long-term capital gains\ndistributed to them by the Fund during the\nprior year, if any. Likewise, the amount of\ntax-exempt income, if any, that a Fund\ndistributes will be reported. Such income must\nbe reported on the shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax return. In general, distributions\nare subject to U.S. federal income tax for the\nyear when they are paid. Certain distributions\npaid in January, however, may be treated as\npaid on December 31 of the prior year. Capital\nGains. Distributions from a Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than qualified\ndividend income or from net tax-exempt income,\nif any), including distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and distributions out\nof a Fund\u2019s net short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as ordinary income.\nDistributions by a Fund of net long-term\ncapital gains, if any, in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses (capital gain dividends)\nare taxable to you as long-term capital gains,\nregardless of how long you have held the\nFund\u2019s shares. Long-term capital gains and\nqualified dividend income are generally\neligible for taxation at preferential rates\nfor non-corporate shareholders. However,\ndifferent preferential rates may apply\ndepending on the type of capital gains, such\nas Fund distributions of certain amounts\nreceived from real estate investment trusts (\n\u201c REITs \u201d ), if any. Return of Capital. If a\nFund\u2019s distributions exceed current and\naccumulated earnings and profits, all or a\nportion of the distributions made in the\ntaxable year may be recharacterized as a\nreturn of capital to shareholders. A return of\ncapital distribution generally will not be\ntaxable but will reduce the shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis and result in a higher capital gain or\nlower capital loss when those shares on which\nthe distribution 27 was received are sold.\nOnce a shareholder\u2019s cost basis is reduced to\nzero, further distributions will be treated as\ncapital gains, if the shareholder holds shares\nof the Fund as capital assets. Distributions\nin excess of a Fund\u2019s minimum distribution\nrequirements, but not in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be taxable to\nshareholders and will not constitute\nnontaxable returns of capital. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by a Fund that\nqualify as qualified dividend income, if any,\nare taxable to you at long-term capital gain\nrates. Dividends will be qualified dividend\nincome to you if they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income received by a Fund.\nGenerally, qualified dividend income includes\ndividend income from stock issued by taxable\nU.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S.\ncorporations, provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements and has\nnot hedged its position in the stock in\ncertain ways. For this purpose, a qualified\nnon-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S.\ncorporation that is eligible for benefits\nunder a comprehensive income tax treaty with\nthe U.S., which includes an exchange of\ninformation program, or if the stock with\nrespect to which the dividend was paid is\nreadily tradable on an established U.S.\nsecurities market. The term excludes a\ncorporation that is a passive foreign\ninvestment company. Dividends received by a\nFund from a RIC, if any, generally are\nqualified dividend income only to the extent\nthat such dividend distributions are made out\nof qualified dividend income received by such\nRIC. Additionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from a REIT, if\nany, and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a Fund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified business income\n\u201d deduction for non-corporate U.S.\nshareholders to the extent that the Fund\u2019s\nincome is derived from ordinary REIT\ndividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.\nFor a dividend to be treated as qualified\ndividend income, the dividend must be received\nwith respect to a share of stock held without\nbeing hedged by the relevant Fund, and with\nrespect to a share of the Fund held without\nbeing hedged by you, for 61 days during the\n121-day period beginning at the date that is\n60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such date. Fund\ndistributions, to the extent attributable to\ndividends from U.S. corporations, will be\neligible for the dividends received deduction\nfor Fund shareholders that are corporations,\nsubject to certain hedging and holding\nrequirements. Substitute dividends received by\na Fund with respect to dividends paid on\nsecurities lent out, if any, will not be\nqualified dividend income. Medicare Tax. A\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is\nimposed on \u201c net investment income, \u201d\nincluding, but not limited to, interest,\ndividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if\nmarried and filing jointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Alternative Minimum Tax. The AMT is a\nseparate U.S. federal tax system that operates\nin parallel to the regular federal income tax\nsystem but eliminates many deductions and\nexclusions. The AMT has different tax rates\nand treats as taxable certain types of income\nthat are nontaxable for regular income tax\npurposes, such as the interest on certain \u201c\nprivate activity \u201d municipal bonds. If a\ntaxpayer\u2019s overall AMT liability is higher\nthan regular income tax liability, then the\ntaxpayer owes the regular income tax liability\nplus the difference between the AMT liability\nand the regular income tax liability. Market\nDiscount Bonds Any market discount recognized\non a bond, including a tax-exempt interest\nbond, is taxable as ordinary income. A market\ndiscount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or adjusted issue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount. To the extent that a\nFund does not include the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gains on the Fund\u2019s\ndisposition of such an obligation will be\ntreated as ordinary income rather than capital\ngains to the extent of the accrued market\ndiscount. Derivatives and Other Complex\nInstruments A Fund may invest in derivatives\nand other complex instruments, and such\ninvestments may be subject to special and\ncomplicated rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund\nare treated as ordinary income or capital\ngains, accelerate the recognition of income to\na Fund or defer a Fund\u2019s ability to recognize\nlosses. In addition, these rules may affect\nthe amount, timing or character of income\ndistributed to you by a Fund. You should\nconsult your personal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules. Non-U.S.\nIncome Taxes Dividends, interest and capital\ngains (if any) earned by a Fund with respect\nto securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may\ngive rise to withholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If,\nat the close of a year, more than 50% of a\nFund\u2019s total assets consist of non-U.S. stocks\nor securities (generally, for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ), generally the Fund may \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to you certain non-U.S. income\ntaxes, including withholding taxes, paid by\nthe Fund. This means that you would be\nconsidered to have received as an additional\ndividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes,\nbut you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your U.S.\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not pass through\nnon-U.S. taxes, the Fund will be entitled to\nclaim a deduction for certain foreign taxes\nthat it incurs. 28 Under certain\ncircumstances, if a Fund receives a refund of\nforeign taxes paid with respect to a prior\nyear, the value of Fund shares could be\naffected or any foreign tax credits or\ndeductions passed through to shareholders with\nrespect to the Fund\u2019s foreign taxes for the\ncurrent year could be reduced. If, at the\nclose of the year, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s\ntotal assets consist of stocks or securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers, including\ndepositary receipts (no matter where traded)\nof non-U.S. companies, or, at the close of\neach quarter, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total\nassets consist of shares of an Underlying\nFund, the Fund may \u201c pass-through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes (including\nwithholding taxes) paid by the Fund or, if its\nassets meet these requirements, the Underlying\nFund. For purposes of foreign tax credits for\nU.S. shareholders of a Fund, foreign capital\ngains taxes may not produce associated foreign\nsource income, limiting the availability of\nsuch credits for U.S. persons. Non-U.S.\nShareholders If you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S.\nentity (other than a pass-through entity to\nthe extent owned by U.S. persons), a Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term capital\ngains), if any, generally will be subject to a\n30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a\nlower treaty rate applies. However,\nwithholding tax generally will not apply to\nany gain or income realized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder with respect to any distribution\nof long-term capital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of Fund shares. Separately,\na 30% withholding tax may be imposed on Fund\ndistributions (if any) paid to certain foreign\nentities, unless such entities comply, or are\ndeemed compliant, with extensive reporting and\nwithholding requirements designed to inform\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury of\nU.S.-owned foreign investment accounts. Backup\nWithholding If you are a resident or a citizen\nof the U.S. and you have not provided a\ntaxpayer identification number or social\nsecurity number and made other required\ncertifications, by law, backup withholding at\na 24% rate will apply to Fund distributions\nand proceeds (if any). Securities Lending If\nyour shares of a Fund are loaned out pursuant\nto a securities lending arrangement, you may\nlose the ability to treat Fund dividends that\nare paid while the shares are held by the\nborrower as qualified dividend income, and you\nmay lose the ability to use non-U.S. tax\ncredits passed through by the Fund. Fund of\nFunds If a Fund invests in an Underlying Fund,\nshort-term capital gains earned by the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will be ordinary\nincome when distributed to the Fund and will\nnot be offset by the Fund\u2019s capital losses. To\nthe extent such Fund is expected to invest in\nan Underlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s realized losses\non sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may\nbe indefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c\nwash sales. \u201d Capital loss carryforwards of\nthe Underlying Fund, if any, will not offset\nnet capital gains of the Fund. Taxes on the\nSale of Exchange-Listed Fund Shares Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund shares is generally treated as a long-\nterm capital gain or loss if the shares have\nbeen held for more than one year. Any capital\ngain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund\nshares that have been held for one year or\nless is generally treated as a short-term\ncapital gain or loss. However, any capital\nloss on a sale of Fund shares held for six\nmonths or less is treated as a long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to such\nshares. Any such capital gains, including from\nsales of Fund shares or from capital gain\ndividends, are included in \u201c net investment\nincome \u201d for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal\nMedicare contribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions Prior to being\ntraded in the secondary market, Fund shares\nare \u201c created \u201d at NAV by Authorized\nParticipants ( i.e. , market makers, large\ninvestors and other financial institutions) in\nblock-size Creation Units or multiples\nthereof. Fund shares are created or redeemed\nonly in Creation Units, and only Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem Creation\nUnits with the Funds. Each Authorized\nParticipant is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC and\nhas entered into a written agreement with the\nFunds\u2019 Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. The\nagreement allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. Authorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units for their own\naccounts or for customers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of the Funds. Creation\ntransactions are subject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the relevant Fund. Generally,\nthere are three transaction methods for\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares: in-kind\nsecurities ( \u201c in-kind \u201d ), partial cash and\nall cash. In-Kind . In a creation transaction,\nan Authorized Participant deposits into a Fund\na \u201c creation basket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets designated by the\nFund, as well as a cash amount. The Authorized\nParticipant receives a specified number of\nCreation Units in return. 29\n\nIn a redemption transaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation Units with a\nFund and receives from the Fund a \u201c redemption\nbasket, \u201d which is a portfolio of securities\nor other assets designated by the Fund, as\nwell as a cash amount. Partial Cash . In a\ncreation transaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits into a Fund a creation\nbasket and a cash amount, including cash that\nreplaces a security or other asset in the\ncreation basket, in exchange for Creation\nUnits. In a redemption transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits Creation Units\nwith a Fund and receives from the Fund a\nredemption basket and a cash amount, including\ncash that replaces a security or other asset\nin the redemption basket. All Cash . In a\ncreation transaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits into a Fund an amount of\ncash specified by the Fund in exchange for\nCreation Units. In a redemption transaction,\nan Authorized Participant deposits Creation\nUnits with a Fund and receives from the Fund a\nspecified amount of cash. The creation and\nredemption baskets for a Fund may differ in\ncomposition, and certain iShares ETFs accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d More information about\ncustom baskets is provided in the Funds\u2019 SAI.\nEach Fund generally engages in creation and\nredemption transactions according to the\nmethod indicated in the table below. In\ncertain circumstances, however, a Fund may use\nanother transaction method ( e.g. , an in-kind\nFund may transact partially or fully in cash).\n                                              \n  Fund            In-Kind  Partial  All Cash  \n  iShares China   \u2713                           \n  Large-Cap ETF                               \n  iShares Global                              \n  Equity Factor            \u2713                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  International   \u2713                           \n  Equity Factor                               \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  International                               \n  Small-Cap       \u2713                           \n  Equity Factor                               \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI                                \n  EAFE Growth     \u2713                           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI                                \n  EAFE Min Vol    \u2713                           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI                                \n  EAFE Small-Cap  \u2713                           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI    \u2713                           \n  EAFE Value ETF                              \n  iShares MSCI                                \n  Europe          \u2713                           \n  Small-Cap ETF                               \n  iShares MSCI                                \n  Intl Momentum   \u2713                           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI                                \n  Intl Quality    \u2713                           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI                                \n  Intl Value      \u2713                           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n                                              \nThe prices at which creations and redemptions\noccur are based on the next calculation of a\nFund\u2019s NAV after a creation or redemption\norder is tendered in an acceptable form under\nthe Authorized Participant agreement. In the\nevent of a system failure or other\ninterruption, including disruptions at market\nmakers or Authorized Participants, creation\nand redemption orders may not be executed\naccording to a Fund\u2019s instructions or may not\nbe executed at all. Additional information\nabout the creation and redemption of Creation\nUnits (including the cut-off times for the\nreceipt of creation and redemption orders) is\nincluded in the Funds\u2019 SAI. The Funds do not\nimpose restrictions on the frequency of\npurchases and redemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with a Fund. The Board determined not\nto adopt policies and procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares because each Fund\ngenerally sells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions that are in-kind\nand/or for cash, with a deadline for placing\ncash-related transactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities. However, the Funds have\ntaken certain measures ( e.g. , imposing\ntransaction fees on purchases and redemptions\nof Creation Units and reserving the right to\nreject purchases of Creation Units under\ncertain circumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of frequent cash\npurchases and redemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased tracking\nerror, disruption of portfolio management,\ndilution to the Funds, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the vast majority\nof trading in Fund shares occurs on the\nsecondary market, which does not involve the\nFunds directly, and such trading is unlikely\nto cause many of the harmful effects of\nfrequent cash purchases or redemptions of Fund\nshares. To the extent a Fund engages in in-\nkind transactions, the Fund intends to comply\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws in\naccepting securities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with redemption\nsecurities by, among other means, assuring\nthat any securities accepted for deposit and\nany securities used to satisfy redemption\nrequests will be sold in transactions that\nwould be exempt from registration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201c 1933\nAct \u201d ). Further, an Authorized Participant\nthat is not a \u201c qualified institutional buyer,\n\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 144A under\nthe 1933 Act, will not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. Because Fund shares may be\ncreated and issued on an ongoing basis, at any\npoint during the life of a Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is used in the\n1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nthat could render them statutory underwriters\nsubject to the prospectus delivery and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nmust take into account all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each particular case.\n\n30\n\nBroker-dealers should also note that dealers\nwho are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution (as contrasted\nto ordinary secondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part of an \u201c\nunsold allotment \u201d within the meaning of\nSection 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be\nunable to take advantage of the prospectus\ndelivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3)\nof the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses\nto exchange members, the prospectus delivery\nmechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\na national securities exchange. Householding\nHouseholding is an option available to certain\nFund investors. Householding is a method of\ndelivery, based on the preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a single copy of\ncertain shareholder documents can be delivered\nto investors who share the same address, even\nif their accounts are registered under\ndifferent names. Please contact your broker-\ndealer if you are interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a single copy of\nprospectuses and other shareholder documents,\nor if you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change your\nhouseholding status. Distribution The\nDistributor or its agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the Funds on an agency basis. The\nDistributor does not maintain a secondary\nmarket in shares of the Funds. The Distributor\nhas no role in determining the policies of the\nFunds or the securities or other assets (as\napplicable) that are purchased or sold by the\nFunds. The Distributor\u2019s principal address is\n50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. BFA or\nits affiliates make payments to broker-\ndealers, registered investment advisers, banks\nor other intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, data provision services, or\ntheir making shares of the Funds available to\ntheir customers generally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such payments, which may\nbe significant to the intermediary, are not\nmade by the Funds. Rather, such payments are\nmade by BFA or its affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or indirectly\nin part from fees paid by the Funds. Payments\nof this type are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions about which\ninvestment options it recommends or makes\navailable, or the level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the payments or\nother financial incentives the intermediary is\neligible to receive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives that are offered\nor made to an intermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary and its\ncustomers and may cause the intermediary to\nrecommend the Funds over another investment.\nMore information regarding these payments is\ncontained in the applicable SAI. Please\ncontact your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional for more information regarding\nany such payments that their firm may receive\nfrom BFA or its affiliates.

The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $48        $151     $263      $591  \n                                      \nS-1\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year end, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 68% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae Global Emerging Green\nTechnologies Select Index SM (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ), which measures the performance of\nequity securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompanies involved in breakthrough innovations\nand new technologies that seek to address or\ncombat climate change, as determined by\nMorningstar or its affiliates ( \u201c Morningstar\n\u201d or the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ). To construct\nthe Underlying Index, the Index Provider\nbegins with securities from the Morningstar\nGlobal Markets ex India Index (the \u201c Parent\nIndex \u201d ) and applies a number of exclusions.\nThe Index Provider excludes constituents with\nan average three-month trailing daily trading\nvolume of less than $2 million or a free float\nmarket capitalization of less than $300\nmillion. The Index Provider also excludes the\nsecurities of companies that it identifies as\nbeing involved in the business of tobacco,\ncompanies involved with controversial weapons,\nproducers and retailers of civilian firearms,\nand companies involved in thermal coal mining,\nthermal coal-based power generation or the\nextraction of oil sands. Certain exclusions (\ne.g., controversial and nuclear weapons or the\nproduction of tobacco products) are\ncategorical, and other exclusions are based on\npercentage of revenue or ownership thresholds.\nAdditionally, the Index Provider excludes\ncompanies that it determines are involved in\ncontroversies related to the ten United\nNations Global Compact ( \u201c UNGC \u201d )\nprinciples, which are classified into four\ncategories: human rights, labor, environment\nand anti-corruption, as well as companies for\nwhich a third party data provider,\nSustainalytics, has assigned a controversy\nscore of 5 (indicating the company experienced\nan event with a severe impact on the\nenvironment and society), or for which the\nIndex Provider has not assigned a controversy\nscore. The Index Provider will apply a series\nof revenue screens on the resulting eligible\nconstituents. First, Morningstar equity\nanalysts evaluate each company\u2019s revenue that\nis derived from \u201c sustainable activities\ninvolvement, \u201d as calculated by the Index\nProvider. Sustainable activities involvement\ncould include the distribution and management\nof energy efficient materials or products, or\npollution remediation services. The Index\nProvider determines whether a company has\nsustainable activities involvement revenue by\nbreaking down the companywide revenue into the\nfollowing eight sustainable themes: Energy\nEfficiency, Green Buildings, Green\nTransportation, Pollution Prevention &\nReduction, Renewable Energy, Resource\nEfficiency Technologies & Services,\nSustainable Agriculture, Food & Forestry, and\nWater. The Index Provider applies the first\nrevenue screen, excluding companies with a\ntotal sustainable activities involvement\nrevenue of less than 25% from the Underlying\nIndex. Following the first revenue screen,\nMorningstar equity analysts research the\nproducts or services identified within the\neight sustainable themes to determine whether\nthe products or services fall within the\nfollowing categories, as defined by\nMorningstar: \u201c green technologies \u201d , \u201c green\nservices \u201d or \u201c green certifications. \u201d Green\ntechnologies are products and services that\nare highly innovative toward sustainability.\nGreen services are services which rely on\ninnovative technologies developed by other\ncompanies. Green certified means that an\nindustry regulator or other third party has\ncertified the product or service as\nsustainable or has certified the elements\nwithin the supply chain of the product or\nservice as sustainable. Morningstar equity\nanalysts consider various metrics to make this\ndetermination ( e.g ., research and\ndevelopment as a percentage of revenue and\ncompany-level patent application data).\nMorningstar excludes all revenue tied to\nproducts and services classified as \u201c green\nservices \u201d or \u201c green certified. \u201d Morningstar\nreviews the green technologies and assesses\nwhether each qualifies as an \u201c emerging green\ntechnology. \u201d The products and services\nclassified as \u201c green technologies \u201d are\nassessed by Morningstar equity analysts and\ndistributed within the Rogers Innovation\nAdoption Curve ( \u201c Adoption Curve \u201d ). The\nAdoption Curve is a theory created by\nProfessor Everett Rogers that explains the\nrate at which the population adopts a new\nproduct, service, or technology over time, and\nwhich labels each product or service as one of\nfive adoption stages: Innovators, Early\nAdopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and\nLaggards. Morningstar assesses a product or\nservice\u2019s total addressable market and current\nmarket share to determine the adoption stage.\nMorningstar Equity Research classifies the\nproducts and services that are labeled\nInnovators, Early Adopters, and Early Majority\nas \u201c emerging green technologies \u201d . Once\nMorningstar identifies the emerging green\ntechnologies, Morningstar applies a second\nrevenue screen: companies with 25% or more of\ntheir revenue represented by emerging green\ntechnologies are eligible for inclusion in the\nUnderlying Index. Following the second revenue\nscreen, the resulting constituents receive an\ninnovation score based on their products\u2019\nand/or services\u2019 adoption stage, as follows:\n\n\u2022 Innovation Score of 1: Early Majority\n\n\u2022 Innovation Score of 2: Early Adopters\n\n\u2022 Innovation Score of 3: Innovators The Index\nProvider calculates a company-level aggregate\nscore by multiplying the company\u2019s revenue\npercentage of each product and/or service\nidentified as an emerging green technology\nwithin each of the eight sustainable themes,\nand the product and/or service\u2019s innovation\nscore, creating a \u201c product score \u201d . Each\nproduct score is summed across the company\u2019s\nproducts and/or services, resulting in the\ncompany\u2019s aggregate score. For example,\nsuppose Morningstar analyzed Company A\u2019s\nproducts and services across the eight\nsustainable themes, and found that 71.7% of\nCompany A\u2019s revenue is allocated to the Energy\nEfficiency theme from Product X, and 28.3% of\nits revenue is allocated to the Green\nTransportation theme from Product Y.\nMorningstar has determined both products are\nemerging green technologies and that Product X\nis an \u201c innovator \u201d on the Adoption Curve,\nearning an innovation score of 3, and Product\nY is an \u201c early adopter, \u201d earning an\ninnovation score of 2. Each product\u2019s revenues\nare multiplied by its respective innovation\nscores to determine its product score. Product\nX\u2019s resulting product score is 2.15 (71.7%\ntimes 3), and Product Y\u2019s resulting product\nscore is S-2 0.57 (28.3% times 2). Company A\u2019s\nresulting aggregate score is 2.72, resulting\nin a Tier 1 designation. Once Morningstar\ncalculates each constituent\u2019s aggregate score,\nMorningstar designates each constituent as\neither Tier 1 or Tier 2 based on their\naggregate score. Tier 1 issuers are those with\nan aggregate score of 1.5 or higher. Tier 2\nissuers are those with an aggregate score of\nless than 1.5. All Tier 1 constituents are\nselected for the Underlying Index. Morningstar\nranks Tier 2 issuers with preference given to\nissuers with a higher aggregate score over a\nlower aggregate score, then a smaller market\ncapitalization over a larger market\ncapitalization. If there are fewer than 50\nTier 1 constituents, the shortfall is filled\nwith Tier 2 constituents, and the Underlying\nIndex is capped at 50 constituents.\nConstituents are float market capitalization-\nweighted with a 6% cap for individual stocks\nand each industry is capped at 15%.\nAdditionally, individual constituents with\nweights of 4.5% or greater in aggregate cannot\ncompose more than 45% of the Underlying Index.\nThe Underlying Index is reconstituted annually\neach December and rebalanced quarterly. The\nIndex Provider does not require that each of\nthe eight sustainable themes be included in\nthe Underlying Index, nor does it require the\ninclusion of a minimum number of Tier 1\nconstituents. In addition, constituents may\noperate business lines that generate revenues\nin industries in addition to those related to\nbreakthrough innovations and new technologies\nand may be associated with multiple industries\nor sectors. The Underlying Index includes\nsmall-, mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies and may change over time. As of July\n31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the industrials and technology\nindustries or sectors. As of July 31, 2024,\nthe Underlying Index consisted of securities\nfrom the following countries: Belgium, Canada,\nChina, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Japan, South\nKorea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United\nKingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) and the U.S. BFA uses\nan indexing approach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund does not try to\n\u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 90% of its\nassets in the component securities of the\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of the Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nBreakthrough Innovations and New Technologies\nRisk. Breakthrough innovations and new\ntechnologies are products or services that\nfundamentally change the dynamics of an\nindustry or market. The Fund's holdings may\ninclude equity securities of operating\ncompanies that focus on or have exposure to a\nwide variety of industries, and the economic\nsuccess of certain of these companies may not\nbe significantly tied to breakthrough\ninnovations and new technologies. Companies\ninvolved in breakthrough innovations and new\ntechnologies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel that\nface intense competition and potentially rapid\nS-3 product obsolescence. These companies may\nnot be exclusively or substantially exposed to\nbreakthrough innovations and new technologies,\nbut may be exposed, directly or indirectly, to\nthe market and business risks of other\ncompanies, industries or sectors. In addition,\nthese companies may depend on intellectual\nproperty or patent rights to protect their\ninnovations or new technologies, which may be\ndifficult to prevent the misappropriation of,\nand are susceptible to competitors that may\ndevelop substantially similar or superior\nproducts or services. ESG Risk. To the extent\nthat the Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. The Underlying Index\u2019s use\nof ESG criteria may result in the Fund\ninvesting in, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Thematic Investing Risk. The Fund\nrelies on the Index Provider to identify\nsecurities that reflect the relevant themes\nand sub-themes for inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex. There is no guarantee that the\nUnderlying Index or the Fund will reflect the\nintended theme and sub-theme exposures. The\nFund\u2019s performance may suffer if such\nsecurities are not correctly identified, if a\ntheme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected\nmanner, or if securities in the Underlying\nIndex do not benefit from the development of a\ntheme or sub-theme. The Fund\u2019s performance may\nalso be impacted if securities that are not\nrelated to the theme or sub-theme are included\nin the Underlying Index. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer as well as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Assets Under Management\n(AUM) Risk . From time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below in Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk ), a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, or another\nfund may invest in the Fund and hold its\ninvestment for a specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such entity would\nnot redeem its investment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at such levels,\nwhich could negatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk. An\n\u201c Authorized Participant \u201d is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof creation units ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only\nan Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. S-4 Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof the non-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or\nif there are delays or limits on the\nrepatriation of foreign currency. Currency\nexchange rates can be very volatile and can\nchange quickly and unpredictably. As a result,\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and without\nwarning. In addition, the Fund may incur costs\nin connection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Custody Risk .\nLess developed securities markets are more\nlikely to experience problems with the\nclearing and settlement of trades, as well as\nthe custody of securities and other assets by\nlocal banks, agents and depositories. These\nissues may have an adverse impact on the Fund,\nincluding losses or delays in payments,\ndelivery or recovery of money or other assets.\nCybersecurity Risk . Failures or breaches of\nthe electronic systems of the Fund, its\nadviser, distributor, Index Provider, other\nservice providers, counterparties, or issuers\nof assets in which the Fund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively impact the Fund\nand its shareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems. The\nFund cannot control the cybersecurity plans\nand systems of its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. In addition, cyber\nincidents may adversely impact the issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund invests, which\nmay cause such investments to lose value.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. S-5 Non-Diversification Risk .\nThe Fund is classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d\nThis means that, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk . Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Reliance on Trading\nPartners Risk . The Fund invests in countries\nor regions whose economies are heavily\ndependent upon trading with key partners. Any\nreduction in this trading may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund's investments. Through its\nholdings of securities of certain issuers, the\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk, European Economic Risk and U.S. Economic\nRisk . Risk of Investing in China . China\nsubjects the Fund to risks specific to China.\nChina may be subject to considerable degrees\nof economic, political and social instability.\nChina is an emerging market and demonstrates\nsignificantly higher volatility from time to\ntime in comparison to developed markets. Over\nthe last few decades, the Chinese government\nhas undertaken reform of economic and market\npractices and has expanded the sphere of\nprivate ownership of property in China.\nHowever, Chinese markets generally continue to\nexperience inefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies resulting from governmental\ninfluence, a lack of publicly available\ninformation and/or political and social\ninstability. Chinese companies are also\nsubject to the risk that Chinese authorities\ncan intervene in their operations and\nstructure. Internal social unrest or\nconfrontations with neighboring countries,\nincluding military conflicts in response to\nsuch events, may also disrupt economic\ndevelopment in China and result in a greater\nrisk of currency fluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate fluctuations and\nhigher rates of inflation. China has\nexperienced security concerns, such as\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Additionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-sponsored\ncyberattacks against foreign companies and\nforeign governments. Actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity and strained\ninternational relations, including purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. Incidents involving China's or\nthe region's security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and the Fund's investments.\nExport growth continues to be a major driver\nof China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in\nspending on Chinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification, institution of\nadditional tariffs or other trade barriers or\na downturn in any of the economies of China's\nkey trading partners may have an adverse\nimpact on the Chinese economy. The Underlying\nIndex may include companies that are subject\nto economic or trade restrictions (but not\ninvestment restrictions) imposed by the U.S.\nor other governments due to national security,\nhuman rights or other concerns of such\ngovernment. So long as these restrictions do\nnot include restrictions on investments, the\nFund is generally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the Underlying Index.\nRisk of Investing in Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s investment in developed country issuers\nwill subject the Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries tend to\nrepresent a significant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed countries have\nexperienced security concerns, such as war,\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a country\u2019s or\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities. Risk of\nInvesting in Emerging Markets . Investments in\nemerging market issuers may be subject to a\ngreater risk of loss than investments in\nissuers located or operating in more developed\nmarkets. Emerging markets may be more likely\nto experience inflation, social instability,\npolitical turmoil or rapid changes in economic\nconditions than more developed markets.\nCompanies in many emerging markets are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries, and as a result, information about\nthe securities in which the Fund invests may\nbe less reliable or complete. Emerging markets\noften have less reliable securities valuations\nand greater risk associated with custody of\nsecurities than developed markets. There may\nbe significant obstacles to obtaining\ninformation necessary for investigations into\nor litigation against companies and S-6\nshareholders may have limited legal remedies.\nThe Fund does not select investments based on\ninvestor protection considerations. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies, small-capitalization companies may\nbe less stable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of small-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge- or mid-capitalization stocks. Small\nFund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s size is small, the\nFund may experience low trading volume and\nwide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund\nmay face the risk of being delisted if it does\nnot meet certain requirements set by the\nlisting exchange. Any resulting liquidation of\nthe Fund could lead to elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative tax\nconsequences for its shareholders. Technology\nCompanies Risk . Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological\nadvances may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, supply chains\nand personnel. These companies typically face\nintense competition, potentially rapid product\nobsolescence and changes in product cycles and\ncustomer preferences. They may face unexpected\nrisks and costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Until the Fund reaches\ngreater scale, it may experience higher\ntracking error than is typical for similar\nindex ETFs. A Fund that tracks an index with\nexposure to non-U.S. issuers may experience\nhigher tracking error than ETFs that do not\ntrack such indexes. Valuation Risk . The price\nthat the Fund could receive upon the sale (or\nother disposition) of a security or other\nasset may differ from the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe security or other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or that are valued\nusing a fair value methodology. The price\nreceived by the Fund also may differ from the\nvalue used by the Underlying Index. In\naddition, the value of the securities or other\nassets in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when investors are\nnot able to purchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that create or redeem\nFund shares on days when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or lower or\nhigher redemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\nassets not been fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology. The ability to\nvalue investments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. Performance Information As of the\ndate of this Prospectus, the Fund does not\nhave a full calendar year of performance\ninformation to report. S-7 Management\nInvestment Adviser. BlackRock Fund Advisors.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui, Greg Savage\nand Paul Whitehead (the \u201c Portfolio Managers \u201d\n) are primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager\nsupervises a portfolio management team. Ms.\nHsui, Mr. Savage and Mr. Whitehead have been\nPortfolio Managers of the Fund since 2023.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an\nindividual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in\nwhich case, your distributions generally will\nbe taxed when withdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase shares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems or other services related to\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-8\n\niSHARES \u00ae CYBERSECURITY AND TECH ETF Ticker:\nIHAK Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment\nObjective The iShares Cybersecurity and Tech\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the\ninvestment results of an index composed of\ndeveloped and emerging market companies that\nare involved in cyber security and technology,\nincluding cyber security hardware, software,\nproducts, and services. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.47%     None       0.00%       0.47%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $48        $151     $263      $591  \n                                      \nS-9\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 27% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe NYSE \u00ae FactSet \u00ae Global Cyber Security\nIndex (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which\nmeasures the performance of equity securities\nissued by companies involved in cyber security\nand technology, including cyber security\nhardware, software, products, and services (as\ndetermined by ICE Data Indices, LLC (the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d or \u201c IDI \u201d )). The Underlying\nIndex is composed of equity securities of\ncompanies primarily listed in one of 43\ndeveloped or emerging market countries that\nare the most involved in, or exposed to, (as\ndetermined by the Index Provider) a cyber\nhardware or cyber software and services\nFactSet \u00ae Revere Business Industry\nClassification systems ( \u201c RBICS \u201d ) sub-\nindustry. As of July 31, 2024, there are 34\ncompanies included in the Underlying Index. 14\nof these companies are located in foreign\ncountries, with 11 in non-U.S. developed\nmarkets and 3 in emerging markets. The Index\nProvider first conducts fundamental research\nto establish a universe of RBICS sectors that\nparticipate in providing cyber hardware or\ncyber software and services, and that universe\nis further refined to include only the most\nrelevant RBICS sub-sectors (as determined by\nthe Index Provider) related to cyber hardware\nor cyber software activities ( e.g. , customer\npremises network security equipment producers,\nnetwork security software providers, and\naerospace and defense IT service providers).\nIn constructing the Underlying Index, the\nIndex Provider maps a universe of the most\nliquid and publicly-traded companies based on\ntheir primary lines of business. The Index\nProvider uses revenues as the key factor in\ndetermining a company\u2019s primary line of\nbusiness, by mapping a company to the sub-\nindustry from which it derives 50% or more of\nits revenues. The companies within these sub-\nsectors are then ranked based on the data and\ninformation in their public filings and\ndisclosures ( e.g. , regulatory filings,\nearning transcripts, etc.) to arrive at a\ngroup of the most relevant RBICS sub-\nindustries (as determined by the Index\nProvider) related to cyber hardware or cyber\nsoftware activities, and the Underlying Index\nincludes the companies that derive 50% or more\nof their revenue from a RBICS sub-industry\nwith exposure to the cyber hardware or cyber\nsoftware and services theme, as determined by\nthe Index Provider. The Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology does not require that at least one\ncompany from each of the sub-industries be\nincluded in the Underlying Index. In addition,\ncompanies included in the Underlying Index may\nalso operate business lines that generate\nrevenue in other industries. To be included in\nthe Underlying Index, companies must also have\na float-adjusted market capitalization of $300\nmillion or greater, but existing constituents\ncould remain in the Underlying Index if the\ncompany's float-adjusted market capitalization\nis at least $225 million. In addition,\ncompanies must have a three month average\ndaily trading value ( \u201c ADTV \u201d ) of $2 million\nor greater, but existing constituents could\nremain in the Underlying Index if the\ncompany\u2019s three-month ADTV is at least $1.5\nmillion. The Underlying Index is reconstituted\nannually, rebalanced semi-annually and\nweighted by float-adjusted market\ncapitalization with individual constituents\ncapped at 4% of the index. The Underlying\nIndex includes large-, mid- and small-\ncapitalization companies and may change over\ntime. As of July 31, 2024 a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the technology\nindustry or sector. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e. ,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is owned,\nmaintained and administered by the Index\nProvider, which are independent of the Fund\nand BFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative S-10 weightings of\nthe securities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in Cybersecurity Companies .\nCybersecurity companies are companies that\nprovide products and services intended to\nprotect the integrity of data and network\noperations for private and public networks,\ncomputers and mobile devices. Like other types\nof technology and industrials companies,\ncybersecurity companies are generally subject\nto the risks of rapidly changing technologies,\nshort product life cycles, fierce competition,\naggressive pricing and reduced profit margins,\nloss of patent, copyright and trademark\nprotections, cyclical market patterns,\nevolving industry standards and frequent new\nproduct introductions. These companies may\nalso be smaller and less experienced\ncompanies, with limited product lines,\nmarkets, qualified personnel or financial\nresources. Such companies may not be\nexclusively or substantially exposed to\ncompanies that provide products or services\nintended to protect the integrity of data and\nnetwork operations, but may be exposed to the\nmarket and business risks of other companies,\nindustries or sectors, and the Fund may be\nadversely affected by negative developments\nimpacting those other companies, industries\nand sectors. Thematic Investing Risk. The Fund\nrelies on the Index Provider to identify\nsecurities that reflect the relevant themes\nand sub-themes for inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex. There is no guarantee that the\nUnderlying Index or the Fund will reflect the\nintended theme and sub-theme exposures. The\nFund\u2019s performance may suffer if such\nsecurities are not correctly identified, if a\ntheme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected\nmanner, or if securities in the Underlying\nIndex do not benefit from the development of a\ntheme or sub-theme. The Fund\u2019s performance may\nalso be impacted if securities that are not\nrelated to the theme or sub-theme are included\nin the Underlying Index. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer as well as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. S-11 Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof the non-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or\nif there are delays or limits on the\nrepatriation of foreign currency. Currency\nexchange rates can be very volatile and can\nchange quickly and unpredictably. As a result,\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and without\nwarning. In addition, the Fund may incur costs\nin connection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Non-Diversification Risk . The\nFund is classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d\nThis means that, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, S-12 expropriation, confiscatory\ntaxation, adverse changes in foreign\ninvestment or currency control regulations,\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital,\nand political instability. Non-U.S. issuers\nmay be subject to different accounting, audit\nand financial reporting standards than U.S.\nissuers, and there may be less publicly\navailable information about non-U.S. issuers.\nForeign market trading hours, different\nclearing and settlement procedures, and\nholiday schedules may limit the Fund's ability\nto engage in portfolio transactions. To the\nextent that investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Reliance on Trading\nPartners Risk . The Fund invests in countries\nor regions whose economies are heavily\ndependent upon trading with key partners. Any\nreduction in this trading may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund's investments. Through its\nholdings of securities of certain issuers, the\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and North American Economic Risk . Risk\nof Investing in Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s investment in developed country issuers\nwill subject the Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries tend to\nrepresent a significant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed countries have\nexperienced security concerns, such as war,\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a country\u2019s or\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Securities Lending\nRisk. The Fund may engage in securities\nlending. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. The Fund could also lose money in the\nevent of a decline in the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or a decline in\nthe value of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-13\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-14\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2019. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-15\n\niSHARES \u00ae ENERGY STORAGE & MATERIALS ETF\nTicker: IBAT Stock Exchange: Nasdaq Investment\nObjective The iShares Energy Storage &\nMaterials ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track\nthe investment results of an index composed of\nU.S. and non-U.S. companies involved in energy\nstorage solutions aiming to support the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, including\nhydrogen, fuel cells and batteries. Fees and\nExpenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                   \n  1 Year  3 Years  \n  $48        $151  \n                   \nS-16\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. From inception (March\n19, 2024) to the most recent fiscal year end,\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 40% of\nthe average value of its portfolio. Principal\nInvestment Strategies The Fund seeks to track\nthe investment results of the STOXX Global\nEnergy Storage and Materials Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which measures the\nperformance of equity securities of companies\ninvolved in energy storage solutions aiming to\nsupport the transition to a low carbon\neconomy, including hydrogen, fuel cells, and\nbatteries as determined by STOXX Ltd. (the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d or \u201c STOXX \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index is composed of U.S. and\nnon-U.S. equity securities selected from the\nSTOXX World AC All Cap Index (the \u201c Parent\nIndex \u201d ). The Parent Index is composed of\nlarge-, mid- and small capitalization stocks\nfrom developed and emerging markets. To\nconstruct the Underlying Index, the Index\nProvider begins with common equity securities\n(including depositary receipts) from the\nParent Index and selects stocks belonging to\nthe eligible country list which have an\nadjusted free-float market capitalization of\ngreater than $200 million and a 3-month median\ndaily traded value greater than $1 million.\nThe Index Provider selects companies involved\nin the energy storage solutions theme using a\ncombination of revenue exposure as defined by\nthe FactSet Revere Business and Industry\nClassification System ( \u201c RBICS \u201d ), and\npatent exposure as assessed using EconSight\u2019s\npatent data. The patent dataset provides a\ntaxonomy that classifies patent filings around\nthe world into specific technology categories.\nThe Index Provider defines two lists of\neligible RBICS Level 6 sectors: Extended RBICS\nand Core RBICS. Extended RBICS Level 6 sectors\nare areas of operation which: have a direct\nlink to the theme; are well positioned for the\ntheme evolution, with existing infrastructure\nand expertise in place; are expected to drive\nthe innovation and viability of energy storage\nand hydrogen economy solutions; and/or\nmanufacture specialty materials and chemicals\nfor the end products, such as batteries and\nfuel cells. Core RBICS are a subset of\nExtended RBICS Level 6 sectors with a direct\nlink to the theme. The patent exposure\nselection involves using EconSight\u2019s patent\ndata to assess a company\u2019s patent holdings for\ninvolvement in the energy storage solutions\nand hydrogen economy technologies theme. The\nIndex Provider first selects companies with\n25% or more revenue exposure from the Extended\nRBICS sectors to create the pre-selection\nlist. The Index Provider further assesses the\ncompanies for their exposure to Core RBICS\nLevel 6 sectors and their patent exposure in\nthe areas related to energy storage and\nhydrogen economy technologies. For patent\nexposure-based selection, the active patents\nfor each technology are captured according to\nspecialized patent-based analysis. The patent\nmetrics used to assess a company's involvement\nin the theme are High Quality Patents and\nPatent Specialization. High Quality Patents is\ndefined as the number of active patents that a\ncompany holds that fall in the top 10% in\nterms of patent quality within a defined\ntechnology. Patent quality is the product of\ncitations (a measure of technology relevance)\nand countries covered within the patent\n(market coverage). Citations can be viewed as\nan external assessment of how competitors\nassessed the importance of a patent. Market\ncoverage is seen as an internal assessment of\nhow patents owners assessed the importance of\ntheir own invention. Both indicators are\nweighted so that newer citations or larger\ncountries are more relevant. The High-Quality\nPatents metric allows for comparisons of\npatent strength between individual companies.\nPatent Specialization is defined as the total\nnumber of a company's active patents\nassociated with the technologies in the theme\ndivided by the total number of the company's\nactive patents. It provides an indication of\nthe importance of the technologies to the\noverall patent activities of the company and\nis a measure of technological innovation. The\nIndex Provider selects index constituents from\nthe pre-selection list using a tiered\napproach, consisting of Tier 1a, Tier 1b and\nTier 2. STOXX classifies Tier 1a companies as\nthose that have 25% or more aggregated revenue\nexposure from the Core RBICS list. The Index\nProvider then uses High Quality Patents and\nPatent Specialization metrics to select\nsecurities for inclusion in Tier 1b and Tier\n2. Only companies that have 50% or more\nrevenue exposure from the Extended RBICS list\nare assessed for inclusion in Tier 1b.\nCompanies included in Tier 1b must rank in the\ntop 10% in terms of High-Quality Patent\nownership and/or have Patent Specialization\ngreater than or equal to 25%. The Index\nProvider then assesses all remaining companies\nin the pre-selection list for inclusion in\nTier 2. Tier 2 includes companies ranked in\nthe top 30% in terms of High-Quality Patent\nownership and/or companies with Patent\nSpecialization greater than or equal to 25%.\nIn addition, the Index Provider excludes all\ncompanies that Sustainalytics, a provider of\nbusiness intelligence on environmental,\nsocial, and governance risks, identifies as:\nviolating or being at risk of violating\ncommonly accepted international norms and\nstandards or other exclusion guidelines based\non a company\u2019s compliance with the United\nNations Global Compact Principles, the\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment Guidelines for Multinational\nEnterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on\nBusiness and Human Rights, and their\nunderlying conventions (collectively, \u201c Global\nStandards Screening \u201d ); being involved with\ncertain controversial weapons, small arms, oil\nsands, thermal coal and tobacco products; or\nhaving a Sustainalytics Controversy Rating of\n\u201c Category 5 (Severe). \u201d After the index\nconstituents\u2019 initial weighting, the Index\nProvider applies weights against their tier\ngroup level, company level and concentration\ncapping limits. The Index Provider applies a\nmaximum of 20% weighting to Tier 2 companies.\nThe component securities in the Underlying\nIndex are weighted by float-adjusted market\ncapitalization with individual securities\ncapped at 8%, 6% and 4% for Tier 1a, 1b, and\n2, respectively. Securities with weights\ngreater than 4.5% will not in aggregate exceed\n45% of the Underlying Index weight at\nrebalance. The Underlying Index is reviewed\nannually in June and rebalanced quarterly in\nSeptember, December and March. As of July 31,\n2024, the Underlying Index comprised of\nsecurities of companies in the following\ncountries or regions: Belgium, S-17 China,\nFrance, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands,\nNorway, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, the\nUnited Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) and the United\nStates. The Underlying Index may include\nlarge-, mid- or small capitalization\ncompanies. As of July 31, 2024, the Underlying\nIndex had 63 securities and a significant\nportion of the index constituents were\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nindustrials and materials industries or\nsectors. The components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over time. BFA uses\nan indexing approach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund does not try to\n\u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 90% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby STOXX, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nEnergy Storage Solutions Sector Risk. The\nmarket value of securities in the energy\nstorage solutions sector may decline for many\nreasons, including, among others, changes in\ntraditional and alternative energy prices,\ngovernment regulations, energy conservation\nefforts, and costs related to exploration,\nmining, and production. Companies in the\nenergy storage solutions sector may depend\nlargely on the availability of certain\nelements necessary for the production of\nbatteries, fuel cells, and related products,\nwhich may be susceptible to fluctuations in\nthe underlying commodities market. Such\ncompanies are also subject to risks related to\nthe obsolescence of existing technology,\ncompetition from new market entrants, and the\npossibility that government subsidies for\nalternative energy will be eliminated. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Materials Companies Risk\n. Materials companies may be adversely\naffected by volatility in commodity prices,\nchanges in exchange rates, social and\npolitical unrest, war, depletion of resources,\nlower demand, overproduction, litigation and\ngovernment regulations, among other factors.\nESG Risk. To the extent that the Underlying\nIndex uses criteria related to the ESG\ncharacteristics of issuers, this may limit the\ntypes and number of investment opportunities\navailable to the Fund and, as a result, the\nFund may underperform other funds whose\nunderlying index does not use ESG criteria.\nThe Underlying Index\u2019s use of ESG criteria may\nresult in the Fund investing in, or allocating\ngreater weight to, securities or market\nsectors that underperform the market as a\nwhole or underperform other funds that use ESG\ncriteria. In addition, the use of\nrepresentative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the S-18 Underlying Index only\nat index reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Market Risk . The Fund could lose\nmoney over short periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over longer periods\nduring more prolonged market downturns. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, acts of\nterrorism, pandemics or other public health\nissues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence\nof a sovereign default or other financial\ncrisis, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments and could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nIndex-Related Risk. The Index Provider may\nrely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Assets Under Management\n(AUM) Risk . From time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below in Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk ), a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, or another\nfund may invest in the Fund and hold its\ninvestment for a specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such entity would\nnot redeem its investment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at such levels,\nwhich could negatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk. An\n\u201c Authorized Participant \u201d is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof creation units ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only\nan Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof the non-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or\nif there are delays or limits on the\nrepatriation of foreign currency. Currency\nexchange rates can be very volatile and can\nchange quickly and unpredictably. As a result,\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and without\nwarning. In addition, the Fund may incur costs\nin connection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Custody Risk .\nLess developed securities markets are more\nlikely to experience problems with the\nclearing and settlement of trades, as well as\nthe custody of securities and other assets by\nlocal banks, agents and depositories. These\nissues may have an adverse impact on the Fund,\nincluding losses or delays in payments,\ndelivery or recovery of money or other assets.\nCybersecurity Risk . Failures or breaches of\nthe electronic systems of the Fund, its\nadviser, distributor, Index Provider, other\nservice providers, counterparties, or issuers\nof assets in which the Fund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively impact the Fund\nand its shareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems. The\nFund cannot control the cybersecurity plans\nand systems of its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. In addition, cyber\nincidents may adversely impact the issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund invests, which\nmay cause such investments to lose value.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\nS-19 companies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. National Closed Market Trading Risk.\nTo the extent that securities or other assets\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or\nin foreign markets that may be closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrade is open, there are likely to be\ndeviations between such asset\u2019s current price\nand its last quoted price ( i.e ., the quote\nfrom the closed foreign market to the Fund).\nThe impact of a closed foreign market on the\nFund is likely to be greater where a large\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a foreign market\nis closed for unscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that may be\ngreater than those experienced by other funds.\nNon-Diversification Risk . The Fund is\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means\nthat, compared with funds that are classified\nas \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a\ngreater percentage of its assets in securities\nor other instruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties and thus\nmay be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk . Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Reliance on Trading\nPartners Risk . The Fund invests in countries\nor regions whose economies are heavily\ndependent upon trading with key partners. Any\nreduction in this trading may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund's investments. Through its\nholdings of securities of certain issuers, the\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and U.S. Economic Risk . Risk of\nInvesting in China . Investments in Chinese\nissuers subject the Fund to risks specific to\nChina. China may be subject to considerable\ndegrees of economic, political and social\ninstability. China is an emerging market and\ndemonstrates significantly higher volatility\nfrom time to time in comparison to developed\nmarkets. Over the last few decades, the\nChinese government has undertaken reform of\neconomic and market practices and has expanded\nthe sphere of private ownership of property in\nChina. However, Chinese markets generally\ncontinue to experience inefficiency,\nvolatility and pricing anomalies resulting\nfrom governmental influence, a lack of\npublicly available information and/or\npolitical and social instability. S-20 Chinese\ncompanies are also subject to the risk that\nChinese authorities can intervene in their\noperations and structure. Internal social\nunrest or confrontations with neighboring\ncountries, including military conflicts in\nresponse to such events, may also disrupt\neconomic development in China and result in a\ngreater risk of currency fluctuations,\ncurrency non-convertibility, interest rate\nfluctuations and higher rates of inflation.\nChina has experienced security concerns, such\nas terrorism and strained international\nrelations. Additionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-sponsored\ncyberattacks against foreign companies and\nforeign governments. Actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity and strained\ninternational relations, including purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. Incidents involving China's or\nthe region's security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and the Fund's investments.\nExport growth continues to be a major driver\nof China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in\nspending on Chinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification, institution of\nadditional tariffs or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions or a trade war between China and the\nU.S. or in response to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any\nof the economies of China's key trading\npartners may have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy. The Underlying Index may\ninclude companies that are subject to economic\nor trade restrictions (but not investment\nrestrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national security, human\nrights or other concerns of such government.\nSo long as these restrictions do not include\nrestrictions on investments, the Fund is\ngenerally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the Underlying Index.\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Fund invests\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they do not meet\nU.S. accounting standards and auditor\noversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund does not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. Risk of Investing\nin Emerging Markets . Investments in emerging\nmarket issuers may be subject to a greater\nrisk of loss than investments in issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\nmarkets. Emerging markets may be more likely\nto experience inflation, social instability,\npolitical turmoil or rapid changes in economic\nconditions than more developed markets.\nCompanies in many emerging markets are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries, and as a result, information about\nthe securities in which the Fund invests may\nbe less reliable or complete. Emerging markets\noften have less reliable securities valuations\nand greater risk associated with custody of\nsecurities than developed markets. There may\nbe significant obstacles to obtaining\ninformation necessary for investigations into\nor litigation against companies and\nshareholders may have limited legal remedies.\nThe Fund does not select investments based on\ninvestor protection considerations. Risk of\nInvesting in Japan . Investing in Japanese\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, currency,\ngeographic and security risks that are\nspecific to Japan. Japan\u2019s economy depends\nheavily on international trade, oil and other\ncommodity imports, and government policy\nsupporting its exports. Other risks facing the\nJapanese economy include significant public\ndebt and deficits, currency fluctuations, and\nlabor shortages due to an aging and declining\npopulation. Japan\u2019s relations with its\nneighbors have been strained at times, which\ncould adversely affect its markets and\neconomy. Japan is also vulnerable to natural\ndisasters. Risk of Investing in the U.S .\nInvesting in U.S. issuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that are specific\nto the U.S. Certain changes in the U.S., such\nas a weakening of the U.S. economy or a\ndecline in its financial markets, may have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small Fund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted\nif it does not meet certain requirements set\nby the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could lead to elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its shareholders.\nThematic Investing Risk. The Fund relies on\nthe Index Provider to identify securities that\nreflect the relevant themes and sub-themes for\ninclusion in the Underlying Index. There is no\nguarantee that the Underlying Index or the\nFund will reflect the intended theme and sub-\ntheme exposures. The Fund\u2019s performance may\nsuffer if such securities are not correctly\nidentified, if a theme or sub-theme develops\nin an unexpected manner, or if securities in\nthe Underlying Index do not benefit from the\ndevelopment of a theme or sub-theme. The\nFund\u2019s performance may also be impacted if\nsecurities that are not related to the theme\nor sub-theme are included in the Underlying\nIndex. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index S-21 does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Until the Fund reaches\ngreater scale, it may experience higher\ntracking error than is typical for similar\nindex ETFs. A Fund that tracks an index with\nexposure to non-U.S. issuers may experience\nhigher tracking error than ETFs that do not\ntrack such indexes. Valuation Risk . The price\nthat the Fund could receive upon the sale (or\nother disposition) of a security or other\nasset may differ from the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe security or other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or that are valued\nusing a fair value methodology. The price\nreceived by the Fund also may differ from the\nvalue used by the Underlying Index. In\naddition, the value of the securities or other\nassets in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when investors are\nnot able to purchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that create or redeem\nFund shares on days when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or lower or\nhigher redemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\nassets not been fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology. The ability to\nvalue investments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. Performance Information As of the\ndate of this Prospectus, the Fund does not\nhave a full calendar year of performance\ninformation to report. S-22 Management\nInvestment Adviser. BlackRock Fund Advisors.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui, Greg Savage\nand Paul Whitehead (the \u201c Portfolio Managers \u201d\n) are primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager\nsupervises a portfolio management team. Ms.\nHsui, Mr. Savage and Mr. Whitehead have been\nPortfolio Managers of the Fund since 2024.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an\nindividual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in\nwhich case, your distributions generally will\nbe taxed when withdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase shares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems or other services related to\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-23\n\niSHARES \u00ae EXPONENTIAL TECHNOLOGIES ETF Ticker:\nXT Stock Exchange: Nasdaq Investment Objective\nThe iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (the\n\u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment\nresults of an index composed of stocks of\ndeveloped and emerging market companies that\ncreate or use exponential technologies. Fees\nand Expenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the tables and examples\nbelow.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.46%     None       0.00%       0.46%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $47        $148     $258      $579  \n                                      \nS-24\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 45% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae Exponential Technologies\nIndex SM (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which\nmeasures the performance of equity securities\nissued by companies that the Global Equity\nResearch team of Morningstar, Inc. (the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d or \u201c Morningstar \u201d ) has\ndetermined are positioned to experience\nmeaningful economic benefits as a supplier,\nuser, or producer of promising technologies.\nExponential technologies displace older\ntechnologies, create new markets and have the\npotential to effect significant economic\nimpacts. The Underlying Index is a subset of\nthe Morningstar Global Markets Index (the \u201c\nParent Index \u201d ). The eligible universe of\nsecurities in the Underlying Index must be in\nthe Morningstar Global Equity Index family and\nscored by Morningstar\u2019s Equity Research\nanalysts. The Morningstar analysts perform\nfundamental research in order to score\ncompanies within the eligible universe along a\nfour-point scale based on exponential\ntechnology themes that Morningstar believes\nhave the potential to have significant\neconomic benefits to producers and users.\nAnalysts project whether exposure to the theme\nwill drive a material net profit increase and\nthen project the percentage revenue in five\nyears the company will derive from exposure to\nthe theme. For companies classified as \u201c\nproducers, \u201d those projected to derive more\nthan 50% revenue are assigned a score of \u201c 4.\n\u201d For companies classified as \u201c suppliers, \u201d\nthose projected to derive more than 50%\nrevenue are assigned a score of \u201c 3. \u201d For\ncompanies classified as \u201c producers or\nsuppliers, \u201d those projected to derive between\n25 and 50% revenue are assigned a score of \u201c\n2. \u201d For companies classified as \u201c producers\nor suppliers, \u201d those projected to derive\nbetween 10 and 25% revenue are assigned a\nscore of \u201c 1. \u201d For companies classified as \u201c\ndownstream users \u201d and all others that are\nprojected to derive less than 10% revenue are\nassigned a score of \u201c 0. \u201d As of October 12,\n2023, Morningstar has identified nine\nexponential technology themes: big data and\nanalytics, cloud computing, energy transition,\nfintech innovation, healthcare innovation,\nhyperconnectivity, nanotechnology, next gen\ntransportation, and robotics. The themes are\nreviewed on an annual basis and may change\nover time. As a general matter, these themes\nfocus on issuers that are either developing\nresources for others or are advanced in their\nown applications in the following areas:\nprocessing and capturing customer or other\nbusiness-related data, and analyzing and\nleveraging that data to grow the business;\nmaking information and applications available\non a scalable, on-demand manner through the\ninternet; working to abate global climate\nchange and reduce greenhouse gases; searching\nfor and acknowledging nontraditional emerging\nfunding sources, platforms, currency, and\nstored and transferred value; unlocking the\nhuman genome; fueling rapid growth in\nconnected devices and a need to push more data\nat faster transmission rates between users and\ndevices; engineering and technology\napplications focused on manipulation of matter\non an atomic, molecular or supramolecular\nlevel; replacing traditional human-operated,\ninternal combustion engine-based vehicles; and\nengaging with the design, construction,\noperation, and application of robots.\nMorningstar\u2019s sector strategists, directors\nand selection committee review the scores\nassigned by the Morningstar analysts and may\ncalibrate or revise the scores to ensure\nconsistency in scoring across analysts,\nsectors, geographies and themes. Morningstar\neliminates companies with average three-month\ntrailing daily trading volume less than $2\nmillion and/or float market capitalization of\n$300 million or less. Constituents are then\nranked in descending order based on the number\nof themes in which a company scores a \u201c 4, \u201d\nthe number of themes in which a company scores\na \u201c 3, \u201d the number of themes in which a\ncompany scores a \u201c 2 \u201d and the number of\nthemes in which a company scores a \u201c 1. \u201d Each\ncompany must receive a score of 1 or higher on\nat least one of the targeted themes to be\nincluded in the Underlying Index. Current\nindex constituents are given preference and\nsmaller market capitalization is preferred\nover larger market capitalization. To ensure\nrepresentation across each theme, Morningstar\nprioritizes theme leaders for inclusion in the\nUnderling Index. Morningstar identifies \u201c\nTheme Leaders \u201d by prioritizing up to the top\n10 scoring companies within each theme based\non the following descending order of\npreference: highest thematic score, with\npreference given to existing index\nconstituents and smaller market capitalization\nover larger market capitalization. From this\nprioritization, companies are added to the\nlist of constituents until the Underlying\nIndex has 200 constituents. After selection\nand weighting of the portfolio, 90% of index\nweight at the time of reconstitution must have\na score of 2 in at least one theme. The\nUnderlying Index is equal weighted and is\nreconstituted and rebalanced annually. The\nUnderlying Index includes large-, mid- and\nsmall-capitalization companies and may change\nover time. As of July 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the technology\nindustry or sector. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, the Underlying\nIndex consisted of securities from the\nfollowing 27 countries or regions: Australia,\nAustria, Belgium, Canada, Cayman Islands,\nChile, China, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Japan, Jersey, the Netherlands, Norway,\nSouth Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,\nTaiwan, the United Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) and\nthe U.S. BFA uses an indexing approach to try\nto achieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. S-25 BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and the Parent\nIndex are sponsored by Morningstar, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and the Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and the Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nExponential Technologies Risk. Technologies\nperceived to displace older technologies or\ncreate new markets may not in fact do so.\nCompanies that initially develop a novel\ntechnology may not be able to capitalize on\nthe technology. Companies that develop\nexponential technologies may face political or\nlegal attacks from competitors, industry\ngroups or local and national governments.\nThese companies may also be exposed to risks\napplicable to sectors other than the\nexponential technology theme for which they\nare chosen, and the securities issued by these\ncompanies may underperform the securities of\nother companies that are primarily focused on\na particular theme. The Fund may invest in a\ncompany that does not currently derive any\nrevenue from exponential technologies, and\nthere is no assurance that a company will\nderive any revenue from exponential\ntechnologies in the future. An exponential\ntechnology may constitute a small portion of a\ncompany\u2019s overall business. As a result, the\nsuccess of an exponential technology may not\naffect the value of the equity securities\nissued by the company. Thematic Investing\nRisk. The Fund relies on the Index Provider to\nidentify securities that reflect the relevant\nthemes and sub-themes for inclusion in the\nUnderlying Index. There is no guarantee that\nthe Underlying Index or the Fund will reflect\nthe intended theme and sub-theme exposures.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance may suffer if such\nsecurities are not correctly identified, if a\ntheme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected\nmanner, or if securities in the Underlying\nIndex do not benefit from the development of a\ntheme or sub-theme. The Fund\u2019s performance may\nalso be impacted if securities that are not\nrelated to the theme or sub-theme are included\nin the Underlying Index. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer as well as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify S-26 or correct them promptly\nor at all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof the non-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or\nif there are delays or limits on the\nrepatriation of foreign currency. Currency\nexchange rates can be very volatile and can\nchange quickly and unpredictably. As a result,\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and without\nwarning. In addition, the Fund may incur costs\nin connection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. S-27 Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk\n. Compared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Non-U.S. Securities Risk .\nSecurities issued by non-U.S. issuers\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to\ndifferent legal, regulatory, political,\neconomic, and market risks than securities\nissued by U.S. issuers. These risks include\ngreater market volatility, less market\nliquidity, higher transaction costs,\nexpropriation, confiscatory taxation, adverse\nchanges in foreign investment or currency\ncontrol regulations, restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to European\nEconomic Risk . Operational Risk . The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited\nto, human error, processing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders, counterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk . The Fund invests in\ncountries or regions whose economies are\nheavily dependent upon trading with key\npartners. Any reduction in this trading may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund's\ninvestments. Through its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers, the Fund is\nspecifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk\nand North American Economic Risk. Risk of\nInvesting in China . Investments in Chinese\nsecurities, including certain Hong Kong-listed\nand U.S.-listed securities, subject the Fund\nto risks specific to China. China may be\nsubject to considerable degrees of economic,\npolitical and social instability. China is an\nemerging market and demonstrates significantly\nhigher volatility from time to time in\ncomparison to developed markets. Over the last\nfew decades, the Chinese government has\nundertaken reform of economic and market\npractices and has expanded the sphere of\nprivate ownership of property in China.\nHowever, Chinese markets generally continue to\nexperience inefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies resulting from governmental\ninfluence, a lack of publicly available\ninformation and/or political and social\ninstability. Chinese companies are also\nsubject to the risk that Chinese authorities\ncan intervene in their operations and\nstructure. Internal social unrest or\nconfrontations with neighboring countries,\nincluding military conflicts in response to\nsuch events, may also disrupt economic\ndevelopment in China and result in a greater\nrisk of currency fluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate fluctuations and\nhigher rates of inflation. China has\nexperienced security concerns, such as\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Additionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-sponsored\ncyberattacks against foreign companies and\nforeign governments. Actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity and strained\ninternational relations, including purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. Incidents involving China's or\nthe region's security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and the Fund's investments.\nExport growth continues to be a major driver\nof China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in\nspending on Chinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification, institution of\nadditional tariffs or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions or a trade war between China and the\nU.S. or in response to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any\nof the economies of China's key trading\npartners may have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy. The Underlying Index may\ninclude companies that are subject to economic\nor trade restrictions (but not investment\nrestrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national security, human\nrights or other concerns of such government.\nSo long as these restrictions do not include\nrestrictions on investments, the Fund is\ngenerally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the Underlying Index.\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Fund invests\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they do not meet\nU.S. accounting standards and auditor\noversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund does not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. Risk of Investing\nin Developed Countries . The Fund\u2019s investment\nin developed country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and S-28 have\ngenerally experienced slower economic growth\nthan some less developed countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nIn addition, developed countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to the economic\nconditions of certain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price\nor availability of certain commodities. Risk\nof Investing in Saudi Arabia . Investing in\nSaudi Arabian issuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that are specific\nto Saudi Arabia. The economy of Saudi Arabia\nis dominated by petroleum exports. A sustained\ndecrease in petroleum prices could have a\nnegative impact on all aspects of the economy.\nInvestments in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers involve risks not typically associated\nwith investments in securities of issuers in\nmore developed countries, which may negatively\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s investments.\nSuch heightened risks may include, among\nothers, the expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets, restrictions on and\ngovernment intervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict, crime and instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Instability in the\nMiddle East region could adversely impact the\neconomy of Saudi Arabia, and there is no\nassurance of political stability in Saudi\nArabia. The ability of foreign investors to\ninvest in the securities of Saudi Arabian\ncompanies could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership of such securities. There\nare a number of ways to conduct transactions\nin equity securities in the Saudi Arabian\nmarket. The Fund generally expects to transact\nin a manner so that it is not limited by Saudi\nArabian regulations to a single broker.\nHowever, there may be a limited number of\nbrokers who can provide services to the Fund,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the\nprices, quantity or timing of Fund\ntransactions. Risk of Investing in the U.S .\nInvesting in U.S. issuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that are specific\nto the U.S. Certain changes in the U.S., such\nas a weakening of the U.S. economy or a\ndecline in its financial markets, may have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Technology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-29\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-30\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2015. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-31\n\niSHARES \u00ae FUTURE CLOUD 5G AND TECH ETF Ticker:\nIDAT Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment\nObjective The iShares Future Cloud 5G and Tech\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the\ninvestment results of an index composed of\ncompanies from developed and emerging markets\nthat could benefit from providing products,\nservices, and technologies related to cloud\ncomputing and 5G. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $48        $151     $263      $591  \n                                      \nS-32\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 37% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae Global Digital\nInfrastructure & Connectivity Index SM (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which measures the\nperformance of equity securities issued by\ncompanies positioned to experience meaningful\neconomic benefits from providing products,\nservices, and technologies related to cloud\ncomputing and 5G, as determined by Morningstar\nIndexes or its affiliates (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c Morningstar \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index provides exposure to the top\n50 companies identified by Morningstar\u2019s\nequity research team as a producer of\npromising digital infrastructure technologies\nconsisting of two themes: \u2022 Cloud computing,\nwhich enables cloud computing applications\nthrough Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and\nPlatform as a Service (PaaS) solutions; and \u2022\n5G, which enables next generation connectivity\nthrough fifth generation broadband cellular\nnetworks. Cloud computing encompasses both\nIaaS and PaaS. IaaS is a solution whereby a\npublic vendor leases commodity equipment and\nservices such as servers, storage, switches,\nand network access. IaaS is closely related to\nPaaS, which incorporates the core software\nneeded to make hardware usable. PaaS includes\nthe operating system, hypervisor, database,\nand development tools, among other solutions.\nService agreements can range from on-demand\nburst capacity or full-time digital\ninfrastructure. 5G, which enables next\ngeneration connectivity through fifth\ngeneration broadband cellular networks, is a\ncollection of technology standards that forms\nthe foundation of wireless networks under\ndevelopment around the world. The standards\nseek to enable significant increases in\nnetwork capacity and speeds, as well as\nimproved network management capabilities.\nThese factors enable the use of millions of\ndevices simultaneously. Future 5G networks are\nexpected to provide links for digital\ninfrastructure between consumer devices,\nsensors, and a host of other users in the\nfield. Using these two themes, the Index\nProvider then makes forward-looking\nassessments rather than relying on single\npoint-in-time metrics to identify relevant\ncompanies. The Index Provider identifies\ncompanies that have any revenue exposure\ntowards a theme today and identifies any\ncompanies that have the potential to drive a\nmaterial net profit increase from that theme\nover the next five years. The Index Provider\nthen assigns a thematic exposure score from\n0-3 to the companies in Morningstar\u2019s global\ncoverage on each theme. The Index Provider\ndesigned the thematic exposure scores to share\na positive correlation with a given company\u2019s\nbeta relative to each theme. The following\nscoring framework is used: no or little\nexposure: 0; modest exposure: 1; moderate\nexposure: 2; and significant exposure: 3.\nThematic exposure scores are reviewed annually\nby Morningstar's equity research team before\neach reconstitution of the Underlying Index to\nhelp ensure the consistency of the scores. The\nUnderlying Index is rebalanced and\nreconstituted annually in December. A 2.5% cap\non the weight of individual securities is\napplied during the rebalancing process. The\nUnderlying Index includes large-, mid- and\nsmall-capitalization companies and may change\nover time. As of July 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the technology\nindustry or sector. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider S-33\ndetermines the composition and relative\nweightings of the securities in the Underlying\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. 5G\nNext Gen Connectivity Risk. 5G and next\ngeneration connections refer to the nascent\ntechnologies forming the foundation of\nwireless networks that are being developed\nglobally. The Fund\u2019s holdings may include\nequity securities of operating companies that\nfocus on or have exposure to a wide variety of\nindustries, and the economic success of\ncertain of these companies may not be\nsignificantly tied to such technologies.\nSmaller 5G and next generation connectivity\ncompanies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel and\nmay be more volatile than other companies.\nThese companies may face intense competition\nand potentially rapid product obsolescence.\nThese companies could be negatively impacted\nby cybersecurity attacks, additional\nregulatory oversight and disruptions in\nservice. These companies may depend on\nintellectual property rights and may be\nadversely affected by the impairment of those\nrights. The customers and suppliers of these\ncompanies may be concentrated in a particular\nlocation or industry and could be subject to\nadverse events occurring in those locations or\nindustries. Cloud-based Computing and Data\nStorage Risk. Companies involved in, or\nexposed to, cloud-based computing and data\nstorage-related businesses may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel that face intense competition and\npotentially rapid product obsolescence. These\ncompanies may not be exclusively or\nsubstantially exposed to the cloud-based\ncomputing and data storage-related businesses,\nbut may be exposed, directly or indirectly, to\nthe market and business risks of other\ncompanies, industries or sectors. In addition,\nthese companies may depend on intellectual\nproperty rights to protect their computing and\nstorage services, which may be difficult to\nprevent the misappropriation of, and are\nsusceptible to competitors that may develop\nsubstantially similar or superior technology.\nCloud-based computing and data storage\ncompanies also depend on the services of third\nparties, which, if interrupted, may impact\ntheir products and services. These companies\nare also potential targets for cyberattacks,\nwhich may have a materially adverse impact on\nthe performance of these companies. Cloud-\nbased computing may face increasing regulatory\nscrutiny and legal liability, which may limit\nthe development of this technology and impede\nthe growth of companies that develop or use\nthis technology. Similarly, the collection of\ndata from consumers and other sources, and\nstorage of that data, may face increased\nscrutiny as regulators consider how data may\nbe collected, stored, safeguarded and used.\nThematic Investing Risk. The Fund relies on\nthe Index Provider to identify securities that\nreflect the relevant themes and sub-themes for\ninclusion in the Underlying Index. There is no\nguarantee that the Underlying Index or the\nFund will reflect the intended theme and sub-\ntheme exposures. The Fund\u2019s performance may\nsuffer if such securities are not correctly\nidentified, if a theme or sub-theme develops\nin an unexpected manner, or if securities in\nthe Underlying Index do not benefit from the\ndevelopment of a theme or sub-theme. The\nFund\u2019s performance may also be impacted if\nsecurities that are not related to the theme\nor sub-theme are included in the Underlying\nIndex. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. S-34 Asset Class Risk. The\nsecurities and other assets in the Underlying\nIndex or in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may\nunderperform in comparison to financial\nmarkets generally, a particular financial\nmarket, another index, or other asset classes.\nAssets Under Management (AUM) Risk . From time\nto time, an Authorized Participant (as defined\nbelow in Authorized Participant Concentration\nRisk ), a third-party investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser,\nor another fund may invest in the Fund and\nhold its investment for a specific period of\ntime to allow the Fund to achieve size or\nscale. There can be no assurance that any such\nentity would not redeem its investment or that\nthe size of the Fund would be maintained at\nsuch levels, which could negatively impact the\nFund. Authorized Participant Concentration\nRisk. An \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d is a\nmember or participant of a clearing agency\nregistered with the SEC, which has a written\nagreement with the Fund or one of its service\nproviders that allows the Authorized\nParticipant to place orders for the purchase\nand redemption of creation units ( \u201c Creation\nUnits \u201d ). Only an Authorized Participant may\nengage in creation or redemption transactions\ndirectly with the Fund. There are a limited\nnumber of institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the Fund,\nincluding on an agency basis on behalf of\nother market participants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to engage in creation\nor redemption transactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the business or\ndo not place creation or redemption orders for\nthe Fund and no other Authorized Participant\nplaces orders, Fund shares are more likely to\ntrade at a premium or discount to NAV and\npossibly face trading halts or delisting.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. Currency Risk . Because the Fund\u2019s\nNAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the NAV\ncould decline if the currency of the non-U.S.\nmarket in which the Fund invests depreciates\nagainst the U.S. dollar or if there are delays\nor limits on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrency. Currency exchange rates can be very\nvolatile and can change quickly and\nunpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV may\nchange quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. S-35 Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk\n. Compared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Non-U.S. Securities Risk .\nSecurities issued by non-U.S. issuers\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to\ndifferent legal, regulatory, political,\neconomic, and market risks than securities\nissued by U.S. issuers. These risks include\ngreater market volatility, less market\nliquidity, higher transaction costs,\nexpropriation, confiscatory taxation, adverse\nchanges in foreign investment or currency\ncontrol regulations, restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of Investing in China\n. Investments in Chinese securities, including\ncertain Hong Kong-listed and U.S.-listed\nsecurities, subject the Fund to risks specific\nto China. China may be subject to considerable\ndegrees of economic, political and social\ninstability. China is an emerging market and\ndemonstrates significantly higher volatility\nfrom time to time in comparison to developed\nmarkets. Over the last few decades, the\nChinese government has undertaken reform of\neconomic and market practices and has expanded\nthe sphere of private ownership of property in\nChina. However, Chinese markets generally\ncontinue to experience inefficiency,\nvolatility and pricing anomalies resulting\nfrom governmental influence, a lack of\npublicly available information and/or\npolitical and social instability. Chinese\ncompanies are also subject to the risk that\nChinese authorities can intervene in their\noperations and structure. Internal social\nunrest or confrontations with neighboring\ncountries, including military conflicts in\nresponse to such events, may also disrupt\neconomic development in China and result in a\ngreater risk of currency fluctuations,\ncurrency non-convertibility, interest rate\nfluctuations and higher rates of inflation.\nChina has experienced security concerns, such\nas terrorism and strained international\nrelations. Additionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-sponsored\ncyberattacks against foreign companies and\nforeign governments. Actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity and strained\ninternational relations, including purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. Incidents involving China's or\nthe region's security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and the Fund's investments.\nExport growth continues to be a major driver\nof China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in\nspending on Chinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification, institution of\nadditional tariffs or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions or a trade war between China and the\nU.S. or in response to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any\nof the economies of China's key trading\npartners may have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy. The Underlying Index may\ninclude companies that are subject to economic\nor trade restrictions (but not investment\nrestrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national security, human\nrights or other concerns of such government.\nSo long as these restrictions do not include\nrestrictions on investments, the Fund is\ngenerally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the Underlying Index.\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Fund invests\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they do not meet\nU.S. accounting standards and auditor\noversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund does not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. Risk of Investing\nin Cloud Computing Companies. Cloud computing\ncompanies include companies that provide\nremote computation, software, data access and\nstorage services. The risks related to\ninvesting in such companies include disruption\nin service caused by hardware or software\nfailure, interruptions or delays in service by\nthird-party data center hosting facilities and\nmaintenance providers, security breaches\ninvolving certain private, sensitive,\nproprietary and confidential information\nmanaged and transmitted by cloud computing\ncompanies, and privacy concerns and laws,\nevolving Internet regulation and other foreign\nor domestic regulations that may limit or\notherwise affect S-36 the operations of such\ncompanies. Also, the business models employed\nby the companies in the cloud computing\nindustry may not prove to be successful. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Securities Lending\nRisk. The Fund may engage in securities\nlending. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. The Fund could also lose money in the\nevent of a decline in the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or a decline in\nthe value of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund. Small\nFund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s size is small, the\nFund may experience low trading volume and\nwide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund\nmay face the risk of being delisted if it does\nnot meet certain requirements set by the\nlisting exchange. Any resulting liquidation of\nthe Fund could lead to elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative tax\nconsequences for its shareholders. Technology\nCompanies Risk . Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological\nadvances may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, supply chains\nand personnel. These companies typically face\nintense competition, potentially rapid product\nobsolescence and changes in product cycles and\ncustomer preferences. They may face unexpected\nrisks and costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Until the Fund reaches\ngreater scale, it may experience higher\ntracking error than is typical for similar\nindex ETFs. A Fund that tracks an index with\nexposure to non-U.S. issuers may experience\nhigher tracking error than ETFs that do not\ntrack such indexes. Valuation Risk . The price\nthat the Fund could receive upon the sale (or\nother disposition) of a security or other\nasset may differ from the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe security or other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or that are valued\nusing a fair value methodology. The price\nreceived by the Fund also may differ from the\nvalue used by the Underlying Index. In\naddition, the value of the securities or other\nassets in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when investors are\nnot able to purchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that create or redeem\nFund shares on days when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or lower or\nhigher redemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\nassets not been fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology. The ability to\nvalue investments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. S-37\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-38\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2021. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an\nindividual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in\nwhich case, your distributions generally will\nbe taxed when withdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase shares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems or other services related to\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

Fees and\nExpenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the tables and examples\nbelow.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.47%     None       0.00%       0.47%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 Professional\nfees for foreign withholding tax claims that\noccurred during the most recent fiscal year\nhave been restated to reflect expected fees in\nthe current year. 3 The amount rounded to\n0.00%. Example. This Example is intended to\nhelp you compare the cost of owning shares of\nthe Fund with the cost of investing in other\nfunds. The Example assumes that you invest\n$10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated and then sell all of your shares at\nthe end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return\neach year and that the Fund\u2019s operating\nexpenses remain the same. Although your actual\ncosts may be higher or lower, based on these\nassumptions, your costs would be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $48        $151     $263      $591  \n                                      \nS-40\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 51% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe NYSE \u00ae FactSet \u00ae Global Genomics and\nImmuno Biopharma Index (the \u201c Underlying Index\n\u201d ), which measures the performance of equity\nsecurities issued by companies in the\nbiopharmaceutical and healthcare equipment and\nservices industries that could benefit from\nthe long-term growth and innovation in\ngenomics, immunology and bioengineering, as\ndetermined by ICE Data Indices, LLC or its\naffiliates (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c IDI \u201d\n). The Underlying Index is composed of equity\nsecurities primarily listed in one of 43\ndeveloped and emerging market countries.\nCompanies must have equal to or greater than\n50% of their revenue from one or more selected\nLevel 6 industries, as defined by the FactSet\nRevere Business Industry Classification System\n( \u201c RBICS \u201d ), which includes\nbiopharmaceutical industries, healthcare\nequipment industries, and healthcare services\nindustries. Companies selected from these\nindustries are assigned a Genomics and Immuno\nBiopharma Composite Relationship Keyword score\n(a \u201c Score \u201d ). To compute a Score for a\ncompany, the Index Provider searches the\nFactSet Supply Chain Relationships database\nfor keywords related to genomics and\nimmunology products and technologies. A Score\nis assigned to each company identified in the\ndatabase search based on the number of\nrelationships a company has to genomics and\nimmunology products. The top 50 companies with\nthe highest Scores are selected for inclusion\nin the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index\nis reviewed and reconstituted annually in\nDecember. Constituent weights of the\nUnderlying Index are determined according to\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization and are\nrebalanced semi-annually. Individual\nconstituents are capped at 4% of the\nUnderlying Index. The aggregate weight of\ncomponent securities classified in the RBICS\nLevel 6 industry Diversified\nBiopharmaceuticals is capped at 25%, with\nexcess weight redistributed proportionately\namong remaining constituents. The Underlying\nIndex includes large-, mid- and small-\ncapitalization companies and may change over\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the healthcare\nindustry or sector. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e. ,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is owned,\nmaintained and administered by the Index\nProvider, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment S-41 objective. Certain\nkey risks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nHealthcare Companies Risk . The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, the\nprotection and expiration of patents, limited\nproduct lines, supply chain issues, labor\nshortages and product liability claims, among\nother factors. Thematic Investing Risk. The\nFund relies on the Index Provider to identify\nsecurities that reflect the relevant themes\nand sub-themes for inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex. There is no guarantee that the\nUnderlying Index or the Fund will reflect the\nintended theme and sub-theme exposures. The\nFund\u2019s performance may suffer if such\nsecurities are not correctly identified, if a\ntheme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected\nmanner, or if securities in the Underlying\nIndex do not benefit from the development of a\ntheme or sub-theme. The Fund\u2019s performance may\nalso be impacted if securities that are not\nrelated to the theme or sub-theme are included\nin the Underlying Index. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer as well as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof the non-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or\nif there are delays or limits on the\nrepatriation of foreign currency. Currency\nexchange rates can be very volatile and can\nchange quickly and unpredictably. As a result,\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and without\nwarning. In addition, the Fund may incur costs\nin connection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\nS-42 companies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Non-Diversification Risk . The\nFund is classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d\nThis means that, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to European\nEconomic Risk. Operational Risk . The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited\nto, human error, processing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders, counterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk . The Fund invests in\ncountries or regions whose economies are\nheavily dependent upon trading with key\npartners. Any reduction in this trading may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund's\ninvestments. Through its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers, the Fund is\nspecifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk\nand North American Economic Risk . Risk of\nInvesting in China . Investments in Chinese\nsecurities, including certain Hong Kong-listed\nand U.S.-listed securities, subject the Fund\nto risks specific to China. China may be\nsubject to considerable degrees of economic,\npolitical and social S-43 instability. China\nis an emerging market and demonstrates\nsignificantly higher volatility from time to\ntime in comparison to developed markets. Over\nthe last few decades, the Chinese government\nhas undertaken reform of economic and market\npractices and has expanded the sphere of\nprivate ownership of property in China.\nHowever, Chinese markets generally continue to\nexperience inefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies resulting from governmental\ninfluence, a lack of publicly available\ninformation and/or political and social\ninstability. Chinese companies are also\nsubject to the risk that Chinese authorities\ncan intervene in their operations and\nstructure. Internal social unrest or\nconfrontations with neighboring countries,\nincluding military conflicts in response to\nsuch events, may also disrupt economic\ndevelopment in China and result in a greater\nrisk of currency fluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate fluctuations and\nhigher rates of inflation. China has\nexperienced security concerns, such as\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Additionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-sponsored\ncyberattacks against foreign companies and\nforeign governments. Actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity and strained\ninternational relations, including purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. Incidents involving China's or\nthe region's security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and the Fund's investments.\nExport growth continues to be a major driver\nof China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in\nspending on Chinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification, institution of\nadditional tariffs or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions or a trade war between China and the\nU.S. or in response to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any\nof the economies of China's key trading\npartners may have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy. The Underlying Index may\ninclude companies that are subject to economic\nor trade restrictions (but not investment\nrestrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national security, human\nrights or other concerns of such government.\nSo long as these restrictions do not include\nrestrictions on investments, the Fund is\ngenerally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the Underlying Index.\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Fund invests\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they do not meet\nU.S. accounting standards and auditor\noversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund does not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. Risk of Investing\nin Developed Countries . The Fund\u2019s investment\nin developed country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and have\ngenerally experienced slower economic growth\nthan some less developed countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nIn addition, developed countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to the economic\nconditions of certain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price\nor availability of certain commodities. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Securities Lending\nRisk. The Fund may engage in securities\nlending. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. The Fund could also lose money in the\nevent of a decline in the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or a decline in\nthe value of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create S-44 or redeem Fund\nshares on days when the Fund is holding fair-\nvalued securities or other assets may receive\nfewer or more shares, or lower or higher\nredemption proceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities or other assets\nnot been fair valued or been valued using a\ndifferent methodology. The ability to value\ninvestments may be impacted by technological\nissues or errors by pricing services or other\nthird-party service providers.

The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-46\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2019. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-47\n\niSHARES \u00ae NEUROSCIENCE AND HEALTHCARE ETF\nTicker: IBRN Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca\nInvestment Objective The iShares Neuroscience\nand Healthcare ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to\ntrack the investment results of an index\ncomposed of U.S. and non-U.S. companies that\ncould benefit from the growth and innovation\nin neuroscience. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.47%     None       0.00%       0.47%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $48        $151     $263      $591  \n                                      \nS-48\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 47% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe NYSE \u00ae FactSet \u00ae Global Neuro Biopharma\nand MedTech Index (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ),\nwhich measures the performance of equity\nsecurities of companies that are involved in\nthe research, development or manufacturing of\nneurology biopharmaceuticals or neurological\ndevices, as determined by ICE Data Indices,\nLLC or its affiliates (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d\nor \u201c IDI \u201d ). To be eligible for the\nUnderlying Index, an equity security must (i)\nbe listed in one of 44 developed and emerging\nmarket countries or regions, (ii) have a\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of at\nleast $100 million and (iii) have a three-\nmonth average daily trading value ( \u201c ADTV \u201d )\nof at least $1 million. Existing constituents\nmay remain in the Underlying Index with a\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of at\nleast $75 million and a three-month ADTV of at\nleast $750,000 at each index reconstitution\nand rebalance. The Underlying Index is\ncomposed of securities that are classified\nwithin one of two sub-industries defined by\nthe FactSet Revere Business Industry\nClassification System ( \u201c RBICS \u201d ): Neurology\nBiopharmaceuticals and Neurology Devices. For\na company to be included in either sub-\nindustry, the sub-industry must represent at\nleast 50% of the company\u2019s annual revenues or,\nfor pre-revenue companies, the company\u2019s\nprimary business as indicated by its product\npipeline, each as determined by the Index\nProvider. The methodology does not require\nthat at least one company from each of the\nsub-industries be included in the Underlying\nIndex. Constituents may also operate business\nlines that generate revenue in other\nindustries. The Index Provider seeks to\nexclude companies whose business description,\ntrade names or supply chain relationships\nindicate an involvement with psychedelics or\ncannabis, as determined by the Index Provider\nbased on an analysis using FactSet keyword\ndata. The Underlying Index is reviewed and\nreconstituted in March and September and\nrebalanced quarterly. Constituent weights of\nthe Underlying Index are determined according\nto float-adjusted market capitalization, and\nindividual constituents are capped at 4% of\nthe Underlying Index at each index\nreconstitution and rebalance. As of July 31,\n2024, a significant portion of the Underlying\nIndex is represented by securities of\ncompanies in the healthcare, neurology\nbiopharmaceuticals and neurology devices\nindustries or sectors. As of July 31, 2024,\nthe Underlying Index consisted of securities\nfrom the following countries or regions:\nCanada, Denmark, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South\nKorea, Sweden, and the U.S. The Underlying\nIndex includes large-, mid- and small-\ncapitalization companies, and its components\nare likely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is owned,\nmaintained and administered by the Index\nProvider, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. S-49 Summary of Principal Risks\nAs with any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nHealthcare Companies Risk . The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, the\nprotection and expiration of patents, limited\nproduct lines, supply chain issues, labor\nshortages and product liability claims, among\nother factors. Neuroscience Companies Risk.\nNeuroscience companies are often subject to\nthe potential or actual performance of a\nlimited number of products or technologies and\nmay be greatly affected if any of their\nproducts or technologies proves to be, among\nother things, unsafe, ineffective or\nunprofitable. Neuroscience companies may not\nbe able to capitalize on such products or\ntechnologies. Neuroscience companies may face\npolitical, legal or regulatory challenges or\nconstraints from competitors, industry groups\nor local and national governments. They are\nalso subject to product liability claims,\npatent expirations and intense competition,\nwhich may affect the value of their equity\nsecurities. Neuroscience companies may be\nthinly capitalized, and their equity\nsecurities may be more volatile than companies\nwith greater capitalizations. Neuroscience\ncompanies are also susceptible to the market\nand business risks of related industries, such\nas the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and\nhealth care equipment industries. Thematic\nInvesting Risk. The Fund relies on the Index\nProvider to identify securities that reflect\nthe relevant themes and sub-themes for\ninclusion in the Underlying Index. There is no\nguarantee that the Underlying Index or the\nFund will reflect the intended theme and sub-\ntheme exposures. The Fund\u2019s performance may\nsuffer if such securities are not correctly\nidentified, if a theme or sub-theme develops\nin an unexpected manner, or if securities in\nthe Underlying Index do not benefit from the\ndevelopment of a theme or sub-theme. The\nFund\u2019s performance may also be impacted if\nsecurities that are not related to the theme\nor sub-theme are included in the Underlying\nIndex. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Assets Under Management\n(AUM) Risk . From time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below in Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk ), a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, or another\nfund may invest in the Fund and hold its\ninvestment for a specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such entity would\nnot redeem its investment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at such levels,\nwhich could negatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk. An\n\u201c Authorized Participant \u201d is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof creation units ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only\nan Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nS-50 to the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments\nare concentrated in the securities or other\nassets of one or more issuers, countries or\nother geographic units, markets, industries,\nproject types, or asset classes. Currency Risk\n. Because the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof the non-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or\nif there are delays or limits on the\nrepatriation of foreign currency. Currency\nexchange rates can be very volatile and can\nchange quickly and unpredictably. As a result,\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and without\nwarning. In addition, the Fund may incur costs\nin connection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large Shareholder and\nLarge-Scale Redemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders of the Fund, including an\nAuthorized Participant, a third-party\ninvestor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an affiliate of\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, a market maker, or another\nentity, may from time to time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares, or may hold\ntheir investment in the Fund for a limited\nperiod of time. There can be no assurance that\nany large shareholder or large group of\nshareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares could require the Fund to dispose\nof assets to meet the redemption requests,\nwhich can accelerate the realization of\ntaxable income and/or capital gains and cause\nthe Fund to make taxable distributions to its\nshareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under certain\ncircumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may\nbe treated as receiving a disproportionately\nlarge taxable distribution during or with\nrespect to such year. In some circumstances,\nthe Fund may hold a relatively large\nproportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Non-Diversification Risk . The\nFund is classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d\nThis means that, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments S-51 are made in a limited number\nof countries, events in those countries will\nhave a more significant impact on the Fund.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Reliance on Trading\nPartners Risk . The Fund invests in countries\nor regions whose economies are heavily\ndependent upon trading with key partners. Any\nreduction in this trading may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund's investments. Through its\nholdings of securities of certain issuers, the\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk, European Economic Risk and North\nAmerican Economic Risk . Risk of Investing in\nDeveloped Countries . The Fund\u2019s investment in\ndeveloped country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and have\ngenerally experienced slower economic growth\nthan some less developed countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nIn addition, developed countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to the economic\nconditions of certain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price\nor availability of certain commodities. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Securities Lending\nRisk. The Fund may engage in securities\nlending. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. The Fund could also lose money in the\nevent of a decline in the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or a decline in\nthe value of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund. Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk . Compared to\nmid- and large-capitalization companies,\nsmall-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of small-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge- or mid-capitalization stocks. Small\nFund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s size is small, the\nFund may experience low trading volume and\nwide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund\nmay face the risk of being delisted if it does\nnot meet certain requirements set by the\nlisting exchange. Any resulting liquidation of\nthe Fund could lead to elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative tax\nconsequences for its shareholders. Tracking\nError Risk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c\ntracking error, \u201d which is the divergence of\nthe Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Until the Fund reaches\ngreater scale, it may experience higher\ntracking error than is typical for similar\nindex ETFs. A Fund that tracks an index with\nexposure to non-U.S. issuers may experience\nhigher tracking error than ETFs that do not\ntrack such indexes. Valuation Risk . The price\nthat the Fund could receive upon the sale (or\nother disposition) of a security or other\nasset may differ from the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe security or other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or that are valued\nusing a fair value methodology. The price\nreceived by the Fund also may differ from the\nvalue used by the Underlying Index. In\naddition, the value of the securities or other\nassets in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when investors are\nnot able to purchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that create or redeem\nFund shares on days when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or lower or\nhigher redemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\nassets not been fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology. The ability to\nvalue investments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders.

The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-53\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2022. Purchase and\nSale of Fund Shares The Fund is an ETF.\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an\nindividual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in\nwhich case, your distributions generally will\nbe taxed when withdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase shares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems or other services related to\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-54\n\niSHARES \u00ae SELF-DRIVING EV AND TECH ETF Ticker:\nIDRV Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment\nObjective The iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the\ninvestment results of an index composed of\ndeveloped and emerging market companies that\nmay benefit from growth and innovation in and\naround electric vehicles, battery technologies\nand autonomous driving technologies. Fees and\nExpenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the tables and examples\nbelow.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.47%     None       0.00%       0.47%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $48        $151     $263      $591  \n                                      \nS-55\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 38% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe NYSE \u00ae FactSet \u00ae Global Autonomous Driving\nand Electric Vehicle Index (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ), which measures the performance of\nequity securities issued by companies that\nproduce autonomous driving vehicles, electric\nvehicles, batteries for electric vehicles, or\ntechnologies related to such products. The\ndetermination of inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex is made by ICE Data Indices, LLC, or its\naffiliates (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c IDI \u201d\n). The Underlying Index is composed of equity\nsecurities of companies listed in one of 43\ndeveloped or emerging market countries that\nderive a certain specified percentage of their\nrevenue from selected autonomous or electric\nvehicle-related industries, as defined by IDI.\nCompanies are selected using a combination of\nrevenue exposure and supply-chain relationship\ndata, as defined by the FactSet Revere\nBusiness Industry Classification System ( \u201c\nRBICS \u201d ). Companies in these autonomous or\nelectric vehicle related industries include\n(i) autonomous and electric vehicle\nmanufacturers, (ii) autonomous software and\nelectronics companies, (iii) autonomous and\nelectric driving technology companies, (iv)\nelectric vehicle battery producers, (v)\nelectric vehicle battery materials producers,\nand (vi) electric vehicle charging companies.\nBased on the Index Provider\u2019s methodology and\nas determined by the Index Provider, companies\nincluded in the Underlying Index include: (1)\ncompanies that generate 50% or more of their\nrevenue from the manufacturing of autonomous\nor electric vehicles; (2) companies that\ngenerate 50% or more of their revenue from\nelectric vehicle battery manufacturing or\ncompanies that generate 50% or more of their\nrevenue from heavy-duty and high-end battery\nmanufacturing or traditional vehicle batteries\nand have products in electric vehicle\nbatteries; (3) companies that generate 50% or\nmore of their revenue in aggregate from\nlithium mining or manufacturing and supply to\ncar manufacturers or companies that have\nrevenue generated from electric vehicle\nbattery manufacturing; (4) companies that\ngenerate 50% or more of their revenue from\nelectric vehicle charging stations or battery\ncharging equipment manufacturing and have a\nbusiness description which includes \u201c electric\nvehicle \u201d ; (5) companies that generate 50% or\nmore of their revenue from autonomous software\nor electronics ( \u201c autonomous software and\nelectronics companies \u201d ); and (6) companies\nthat in aggregate generate 50% or more of\ntheir revenue from 8 selected automotive value\nchain industries and are a supplier to at\nleast one autonomous or electric vehicle\nmanufacturing company ( \u201c autonomous and\nelectric driving technology companies \u201d ). The\ncomponent securities of the Underlying Index\nare weighted by float adjusted market\ncapitalization with individual securities\ncapped at 4%. The weight of autonomous\nsoftware and electronics companies and\nautonomous and electric driving technology\ncompanies are in aggregate capped at 25%. The\nUnderlying Index will be reviewed and\nreconstituted annually in December each year.\nConstituent weights of the Underlying Index\nare rebalanced semi-annually. The Underlying\nIndex includes large-, mid- and small-\ncapitalization companies and may change over\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the automotive,\nconsumer discretionary, industrials and\ntechnology industries or sectors. As of July\n31, 2024, the Underlying Index was comprised\nof 49 components. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. The Underlying Index includes technology\ncompanies that are involved in or exposed to,\nself-driving or electric vehicle-related\nindustries. These companies may not be\nexclusively or substantially exposed to the\ninformation technology industry and may be\nclassified in the consumer discretionary,\nindustrials or materials industries or\nsectors. BFA uses an indexing approach to try\nto achieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but S-56 which BFA believes will help\nthe Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and\ncash equivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is owned,\nmaintained and administered by the Index\nProvider, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nElectric Vehicles Sector Risk. Companies\ninvolved in, or exposed to, electric vehicles-\nrelated businesses may have limited product\nlines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. Electric vehicle technology is a\nrelatively new technology and is subject to\nrisks associated with a developing industry.\nThese risks include intense competition,\ndelays or other complications in connection\nwith production, rapid product obsolescence,\nincreased government regulation and market\nvolatility. Many companies involved in, or\nexposed to, electric vehicles-related\nbusinesses depend significantly on retaining\nand growing the consumer base of their\nproducts and services. Such companies may not\nbe exclusively or substantially exposed to the\nelectric vehicles sector, but may be\nsubstantially exposed to the market and\nbusiness risks of other industries or sectors,\nand the Fund may be adversely affected by\nnegative developments impacting those\ncompanies, industries or sectors. Electric\nvehicle companies currently benefit from\ncertain government subsidiaries, policies and\neconomic incentives, which may be reduced or\neliminated in the future. In addition, these\ncompanies may be adversely affected by loss or\nimpairment of intellectual property rights.\nThere can be no assurance that companies\ninvolved in electric vehicle technology will\nbe able to successfully protect their\nintellectual property to prevent the\nmisappropriation of their technology, or that\ncompetitors will not develop technology that\nis substantially similar or superior to such\ncompanies\u2019 technology. Electric vehicle\ncompanies typically engage in significant\namounts of spending on research and\ndevelopment, and there is no guarantee that\nthe products or services produced by these\ncompanies will be successful. These companies\nare also susceptible to litigation based on\nproduct liability claims and can be\nsignificantly affected by insurance costs. In\naddition, electric vehicle companies may not\nmaintain as much insurance coverage as other\ntypes of companies and any insurance coverage\nmay not be sufficient to cover all losses or\nclaims. Autonomous Driving Sector Risk.\nCompanies involved in, or exposed to,\nautonomous driving-related businesses may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources or personnel. Autonomous driving\ntechnology is a relatively new technology and\nis subject to risks associated with a\ndeveloping industry. These risks include\nintense competition, delays or other\ncomplications in connection with production,\nrapid product obsolescence, increased\ngovernment regulation and market volatility.\nAs a new technology, any product defects,\ndelays in the implementation of full\nautonomous driving or legal restrictions could\nhave an adverse effect on the businesses of\nautonomous driving companies. Such companies\nmay not be exclusively or substantially\nexposed to the autonomous driving sector, but\nmay be substantially exposed to the market and\nbusiness risks of other industries or sectors,\nand the Fund may be adversely affected by\nnegative developments impacting those\ncompanies, industries or sectors. In addition,\nthese companies may be adversely affected by\nloss or impairment of intellectual property\nrights. There can be no assurance that\ncompanies involved in autonomous driving\ntechnology will be able to successfully\nprotect their intellectual property to prevent\nthe misappropriation of their technology, or\nthat competitors will not develop technology\nthat is substantially similar or superior to\nsuch companies\u2019 technology. Autonomous driving\ncompanies typically engage in significant\namounts of spending on research and\ndevelopment, and there is no guarantee that\nthe products or services produced by these\ncompanies will be successful. These companies\nare also susceptible to litigation based on\nproduct liability claims and can be\nsignificantly affected by insurance costs. In\naddition, autonomous driving companies may not\nmaintain as much insurance coverage as other\ntypes of companies and any insurance coverage\nmay not be sufficient to cover all losses or\nclaims. Thematic Investing Risk. The Fund\nrelies on the Index Provider to identify\nsecurities that reflect the relevant themes\nand sub-themes for inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex. There is no guarantee that the\nUnderlying Index or the Fund will reflect the\nintended theme and sub-theme exposures. The\nFund\u2019s performance may suffer if such\nsecurities are not correctly identified, if a\ntheme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected\nmanner, or if securities in the Underlying\nIndex do not benefit from the development of a\ntheme or sub-theme. The Fund\u2019s performance may\nalso be impacted if securities that are not\nrelated to the theme or sub-theme are included\nin the Underlying Index. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other S-57 asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Automotive Sub-\nIndustry Risk . The automotive sub-industry\ncan be highly cyclical and companies in the\nautomotive sub-industry may suffer periodic\nlosses. Among other things, the automotive\nsub-industry is susceptible to labor disputes,\neconomic downturns and increase in component\nand material prices. As a result, such risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investments. Concentration Risk.\nThe Fund may be susceptible to an increased\nrisk of loss, including losses due to adverse\nevents that affect the Fund\u2019s investments more\nthan the market as a whole, to the extent that\nthe Fund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. Consumer Goods and Services Companies\nRisk. Consumer goods and services companies (\n\u201c consumer companies \u201d ) face risks related to\nchanges in consumer preferences and disposable\nincome, commodity prices, government\nregulation, supply chain disruptions, damage\nto brand or reputation, economic slowdown and\nlabor shortages, among other things. Currency\nRisk . Because the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in\nU.S. dollars, the NAV could decline if the\ncurrency of the non-U.S. market in which the\nFund invests depreciates against the U.S.\ndollar or if there are delays or limits on the\nrepatriation of foreign currency. Currency\nexchange rates can be very volatile and can\nchange quickly and unpredictably. As a result,\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and without\nwarning. In addition, the Fund may incur costs\nin connection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Industrial\nCompanies Risk. Industrial companies face a\nnumber of risks, including supply chain and\ndistribution disruptions, business\ninterruptions, product obsolescence, third-\nparty vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be S-58 more\nmature and subject to more limited growth\npotential compared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Non-Diversification Risk . The\nFund is classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d\nThis means that, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and European Economic Risk . Operational\nRisk . The Fund is exposed to operational\nrisks arising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u2019s service providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through controls and\nprocedures. However, these measures do not\naddress every possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant operational\nrisks. Risk of Investing in China .\nInvestments in Chinese securities, including\ncertain Hong Kong-listed and U.S.-listed\nsecurities, subject the Fund to risks specific\nto China. China may be subject to considerable\ndegrees of economic, political and social\ninstability. China is an emerging market and\ndemonstrates significantly higher volatility\nfrom time to time in comparison to developed\nmarkets. Over the last few decades, the\nChinese government has undertaken reform of\neconomic and market practices and has expanded\nthe sphere of private ownership of property in\nChina. However, Chinese markets generally\ncontinue to experience inefficiency,\nvolatility and pricing anomalies S-59\nresulting from governmental influence, a lack\nof publicly available information and/or\npolitical and social instability. Chinese\ncompanies are also subject to the risk that\nChinese authorities can intervene in their\noperations and structure. Internal social\nunrest or confrontations with neighboring\ncountries, including military conflicts in\nresponse to such events, may also disrupt\neconomic development in China and result in a\ngreater risk of currency fluctuations,\ncurrency non-convertibility, interest rate\nfluctuations and higher rates of inflation.\nChina has experienced security concerns, such\nas terrorism and strained international\nrelations. Additionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-sponsored\ncyberattacks against foreign companies and\nforeign governments. Actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity and strained\ninternational relations, including purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. Incidents involving China's or\nthe region's security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and the Fund's investments.\nExport growth continues to be a major driver\nof China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in\nspending on Chinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification, institution of\nadditional tariffs or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions or a trade war between China and the\nU.S. or in response to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any\nof the economies of China's key trading\npartners may have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy. The Underlying Index may\ninclude companies that are subject to economic\nor trade restrictions (but not investment\nrestrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national security, human\nrights or other concerns of such government.\nSo long as these restrictions do not include\nrestrictions on investments, the Fund is\ngenerally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the Underlying Index.\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Fund invests\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they do not meet\nU.S. accounting standards and auditor\noversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund does not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. Risk of Investing\nin Developed Countries . The Fund\u2019s investment\nin developed country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and have\ngenerally experienced slower economic growth\nthan some less developed countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nIn addition, developed countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to the economic\nconditions of certain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price\nor availability of certain commodities. Risk\nof Investing in Russia. Investing in Russian\nsecurities involves significant risks,\nincluding legal, regulatory, currency and\neconomic risks that are specific to Russia. In\naddition, investing in Russian securities\ninvolves risks associated with the settlement\nof portfolio transactions and loss of the\nFund\u2019s ownership rights in its portfolio\nsecurities as a result of the system of share\nregistration and custody in Russia.\nGovernments, including the U.S., the U.K., the\nE.U., and many other countries have imposed\neconomic sanctions on certain Russian\nindividuals and Russian corporate and banking\nentities, and jurisdictions may also institute\nbroader sanctions on Russia. Russia has issued\na number of countersanctions, some of which\nrestrict the distribution of profits by\nlimited liability companies (e.g., dividends),\nand prohibit Russian persons from entering\ninto transactions with designated persons from\n\u201c unfriendly states \u201d as well as the export of\nraw materials or other products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons. Russia launched a\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies, or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia\u2019s\neconomy and Russian companies in which the\nFund invests. Actual and threatened responses\nto Russian military action may also impact the\nmarkets for certain Russian commodities, such\nas oil and natural gas, as well as other\nsectors of the Russian economy, and are likely\nto have collateral impacts on such sectors\nglobally. Russian companies may be unable to\npay dividends and, if they pay dividends, the\nFund may be unable to receive them. As a\nresult of sanctions, the Fund is currently\nrestricted from trading in Russian securities,\nincluding those in its portfolio, and the\nUnderlying Index has removed Russian\nsecurities. It is unknown when, or if,\nsanctions may be lifted or the Fund\u2019s ability\nto trade in Russian securities will resume.\nRisk of Investing in the U.S . Investing in\nU.S. issuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Securities Lending\nRisk. The Fund may engage in securities\nlending. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. The Fund could also lose money in the\nevent of a decline in the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or a decline in\nthe value of any S-60 investments made with\ncash collateral. These events could also\ntrigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. A Fund that tracks an index\nwith exposure to non-U.S. issuers may\nexperience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could receive upon\nthe sale (or other disposition) of a security\nor other asset may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-62\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2019. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-63\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. TECH BREAKTHROUGH MULTISECTOR\nETF Ticker: TECB Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca\nInvestment Objective The iShares U.S. Tech\nBreakthrough Multisector ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d )\nseeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of U.S. companies that could\nbenefit from various breakthrough\ntechnologies, including robotics and\nartificial intelligence, cloud and data tech,\ncybersecurity, genomics and immunology, and\nfinancial technology. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses.

Example. This Example is intended to\nhelp you compare the cost of owning shares of\nthe Fund with the cost of investing in other\nfunds. The Example assumes that you invest\n$10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated and then sell all of your shares at\nthe end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return\neach year and that the Fund\u2019s operating\nexpenses remain the same. Although your actual\ncosts may be higher or lower, based on these\nassumptions, your costs would be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $31         $97     $169      $381  \n                                      \nS-64\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 15% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe NYSE \u00ae FactSet \u00ae U.S. Tech Breakthrough\nIndex (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which\nmeasures the performance of U.S. listed\ncompanies engaged in cutting edge research and\ndevelopment of products and services in the\nareas of robotics and artificial intelligence,\ncyber security, cloud and data tech, financial\ntechnology, and genomics and immunology (as\ndetermined by ICE Data Indices, LLC or its\naffiliates) (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c IDI \u201d\n). Companies selected must belong to one of\nthe five aforementioned thematic segments and\nmust meet the eligibility requirements of that\nsegment to which the company is classified as\ndefined by the FactSet Revere Business\nIndustry Classification Systems ( \u201c RBICS \u201d ).\nThe eligibility requirements for the Robotics\nand Artificial Intelligence theme are\nsecurities with a minimum float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization of $500 million or\ngreater, and a three-month average daily\ntrading value ( \u201c ADTV \u201d ) of $2 million or\ngreater on the Reference Date. \u201c Reference\nDate \u201d means the date on which data is used to\nreconstitute the Underlying Index, which is as\nof the close of business on the first Friday\nin December, and the date on which data is\nused to rebalance the Underling Index, which\nis as of the close of business on the first\nFriday in June and December. Companies must\nalso be classified as (1) deriving 50% or more\nrevenues from one of 22 RBICS Focus Level 6\nindustries related to Robotics and Artificial\nIntelligence, or (2) have a 20% or more market\nshare or generate $1 billion or more in\nabsolute annual revenues from one of the 22\naforementioned RBICS Level 6 industry\nclassifications. The eligibility requirements\nfor the Cyber Security theme are securities\nwith a minimum float-adjusted market\ncapitalization of $300 million or greater, and\na three-month ADTV of $2 million or greater on\nthe Reference Date. Companies must also be\nclassified as deriving 50% or more revenues\nfrom one of 12 RBICS Focus Level 6 industries\nrelated to Cyber Security, with additional\nscreens applied to companies classified to \u201c\nMulti-Type Home and Office Software. \u201d The\neligibility requirements for the Cloud and\nData Tech theme are securities with a minimum\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of $300\nmillion or greater, and a three-month ADTV of\n$2 million or greater on the Reference Date.\nCompanies must also be classified as deriving\n50% or more revenues from one of 20 RBICS\nFocus Level 6 industries related to Cloud and\nData Tech, with additional screens applied to\ncompanies classified to 4 RBICS Focus Level 6\nindustries: \u201c Industrial and Warehouse Equity\nREITs \u201d , \u201c Multi-Type Equity REITs \u201d , \u201c\nGeneral and Mixed-Type Software \u201d or \u201c General\nInformation Technology (IT) Consulting. \u201d The\neligibility requirements for the Financial\nTechnology theme are securities with a minimum\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of $300\nmillion or greater, and a three-month ADTV of\n$2 million or greater on the Reference Date.\nCompanies must also be classified as deriving\n50% or more revenues from one of 17 RBICS\nFocus Level 6 industries related to Financial\nTechnology. The eligibility requirements for\nthe Genomics and Immunology theme are\nsecurities with a minimum float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization of $300 million or\ngreater, and a three-month ADTV of $2 million\nor greater on the Reference Date. Companies\nmust also be classified as deriving 50% or\nmore revenues from one of 60 RBICS Focus Level\n6 industries related to Genomics and\nImmunology. A Genomics and Immuno\nBiopharmaceutical composite relationship\nkeyword score is then calculated for each\nselected company based on the number of\nrelationships mentioning keywords related to\nGenomics and Immuno Biopharmaceutical products\nand technologies. Companies are ranked in\ndescending order and the top 50 ranked\ncompanies are selected for the Genomics and\nImmunology theme. All eligible securities that\nhave been assigned to one of the five\naforementioned themes must also be primarily\nlisted on one of the four U.S. exchanges:\nNYSE, NYSE American, Nasdaq or CBOE. All\neligible issuers must also be incorporated in\nthe U.S. Finally, all remaining securities\nmust also have a minimum float-adjusted market\ncapitalization of $500 million or greater, and\na three-month ADTV of $2 million or greater on\nthe Reference Date. The Underlying Index is\nweighted according to the component stocks\u2019\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization by\ndividing their individual float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization by the total float-\nadjusted market capitalization of all\nconstituents, with individual security weights\ncapped at 4% and individual thematic segment\nweights maintained at a minimum of 10%. The\nUnderlying Index is reviewed and reconstituted\nannually in December. Constituent weights of\nthe Underlying Index are rebalanced\nsemiannually. The Underlying Index includes\nlarge-, mid- and small-capitalization\ncompanies and may change over time. In\naddition, certain companies included in the\nUnderlying Index may also operate in business\nlines other than the theme to which they are\nassigned that also generate revenue in other\nindustries. As of July 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the technology\nindustry or sector. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market S-65 funds\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as\nin securities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is owned,\nmaintained and administered by the Index\nProvider, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Technology Companies\nRisk . Technology companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technological advances may\nhave limited product lines, markets, financial\nresources, supply chains and personnel. These\ncompanies typically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Thematic Investing\nRisk. The Fund relies on the Index Provider to\nidentify securities that reflect the relevant\nthemes and sub-themes for inclusion in the\nUnderlying Index. There is no guarantee that\nthe Underlying Index or the Fund will reflect\nthe intended theme and sub-theme exposures.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance may suffer if such\nsecurities are not correctly identified, if a\ntheme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected\nmanner, or if securities in the Underlying\nIndex do not benefit from the development of a\ntheme or sub-theme. The Fund\u2019s performance may\nalso be impacted if securities that are not\nrelated to the theme or sub-theme are included\nin the Underlying Index. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer as well as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Cloud-based\nComputing and Data Storage Risk. Companies\ninvolved in, or exposed to, cloud-based\ncomputing and data storage-related businesses\nmay have limited product lines, markets,\nfinancial resources or personnel that face\nintense S-66 competition and potentially rapid\nproduct obsolescence. These companies may not\nbe exclusively or substantially exposed to the\ncloud-based computing and data storage-related\nbusinesses, but may be exposed, directly or\nindirectly, to the market and business risks\nof other companies, industries or sectors. In\naddition, these companies may depend on\nintellectual property rights to protect their\ncomputing and storage services, which may be\ndifficult to prevent the misappropriation of,\nand are susceptible to competitors that may\ndevelop substantially similar or superior\ntechnology. Cloud-based computing and data\nstorage companies also depend on the services\nof third parties, which, if interrupted, may\nimpact their products and services. These\ncompanies are also potential targets for\ncyberattacks, which may have a materially\nadverse impact on the performance of these\ncompanies. Cloud-based computing may face\nincreasing regulatory scrutiny and legal\nliability, which may limit the development of\nthis technology and impede the growth of\ncompanies that develop or use this technology.\nSimilarly, the collection of data from\nconsumers and other sources, and storage of\nthat data, may face increased scrutiny as\nregulators consider how data may be collected,\nstored, safeguarded and used. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of Investing in Cloud\nComputing Companies. Cloud computing companies\ninclude companies that provide remote\ncomputation, software, data access and storage\nservices. The risks related to investing in\nsuch companies include disruption in service\ncaused by hardware or software failure,\ninterruptions or delays in service by third-\nparty data center hosting facilities and\nmaintenance providers, security breaches\ninvolving certain private, sensitive,\nproprietary and confidential information\nmanaged and transmitted by cloud computing\ncompanies, and privacy concerns and laws,\nevolving Internet regulation and other foreign\nor domestic regulations that may limit or\notherwise affect the operations of such\ncompanies. Also, the business models employed\nby the companies in the cloud computing\nindustry may not prove to be successful.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may engage\nin securities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions.

The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-68\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2020. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to\nas an \u201c ETF \u201d ). Individual shares of the Fund\nmay only be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer. Because ETF\nshares trade at market prices rather than at\nNAV, shares may trade at a price greater than\nNAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount).\nAn investor may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of\nthe Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller\nis willing to accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ).\nTax Information The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an\nindividual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in\nwhich case, your distributions generally will\nbe taxed when withdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase shares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems or other services related to\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund.

Shares of each Fund are\nlisted on a national securities exchange and\ntrade in the secondary market at market prices\nthat change throughout the day. The market\nprice for a share of a Fund may be different\nfrom the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV.\n\n1\n\nEach Fund invests in a particular segment of\nthe markets for securities and other\ninstruments (as applicable) and is designed to\nbe used as part of broader asset allocation\nstrategies. Accordingly, an investment in a\nFund should not constitute a complete\ninvestment program. An investment in a Fund is\nnot a bank deposit, and it is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, any other government agency, BFA\nor any of BFA\u2019s affiliates. Index Funds A\nshare of a Fund represents an ownership\ninterest in an underlying portfolio of\nsecurities and other instruments (as\napplicable) that is intended to track the\nFund\u2019s Underlying Index. An index is a\nfinancial calculation, based on a grouping of\nfinancial instruments, and is not an\ninvestment product, while each Fund is an\nactual investment portfolio. The performance\nof a Fund and that of its Underlying Index may\nvary for a number of reasons, including\ntransaction costs, asset or currency\nvaluations, corporate actions, timing\nvariances and differences between the\ncomposition of a Fund\u2019s portfolio and that of\nthe Underlying Index resulting from the Fund\u2019s\nuse of representative sampling or from legal\nrestrictions (such as diversification\nrequirements) that apply to the Fund but not\nto its Underlying Index. From time to time,\nthe provider of the Underlying Index ( \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ) may make changes to the index\nmethodology or other adjustments to a Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index. Unless otherwise determined\nby BFA, any such change will be reflected in\nthe calculation of the Underlying Index\u2019s\nperformance on a going-forward basis after the\neffective date of such change. Therefore, the\nperformance of the Underlying Index that is\nshown for periods prior to the effective date\nof any such change generally will not be\nrecalculated or restated to reflect the\nchange. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Funds. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of the applicable underlying index.\nBecause the Funds use representative sampling,\nthey can be expected to have a larger tracking\nerror than if they used a replication indexing\nstrategy. \u201c Replication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests in\nsubstantially all of the securities in its\nunderlying index in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying index.\nBorrowing Each Fund listed below may borrow as\na temporary measure for extraordinary or\nemergency purposes, including to meet\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. Each Fund\ndoes not intend to borrow money in order to\nleverage its portfolio. iShares Breakthrough\nEnvironmental Solutions ETF\niShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF\niShares Exponential Technologies ETF iShares\nFuture Cloud 5G and Tech ETF\niShares Genomics Immunology and Healthcare ETF\niShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF\nAdditional Index Information \u2013 iShares\nBreakthrough Environmental Solutions ETF To\nconstruct the Underlying Index, the Index\nProvider begins with securities from the\nMorningstar Global Markets ex India Index (the\n\u201c Parent Index \u201d ) and applies a number of\nexclusions. The Index Provider excludes\nconstituents with an average three-month\ntrailing daily trading volume of less than $2\nmillion or a free float market capitalization\nof less than $300 million. The Index Provider\nalso excludes the securities of companies that\nit identifies as being involved in the\nbusiness of tobacco, companies involved with\ncontroversial weapons, producers and retailers\nof civilian firearms, and companies involved\nin thermal coal mining, thermal coal-based\npower generation or the extraction of oil\nsands. Certain exclusions ( e.g. ,\ncontroversial and nuclear weapons or the\nproduction of tobacco products) are\ncategorical, and other exclusions are based on\npercentage of revenue or ownership thresholds\n(as discussed below). Categorical exclusions\ninclude any issuer that has any involvement\nin: \u25a0 the sale of assault or non-assault\nweapons; \u25a0 the manufacture of small arms\ncomponents; \u25a0 the production of tobacco\nproducts; and \u25a0 controversial and nuclear\nweapons ( e.g. , antipersonnel mines,\nbiological and chemical weapons, depleted\nuranium, nuclear weapons, or white\nphosphorus). Additionally, the Index Provider\ncategorically excludes companies that it\ndetermines are involved in controversies\nrelated to the ten United Nations Global\nCompact ( \u201c UNGC \u201d ) principles, which are\nclassified into four categories: human rights,\nlabor, environment and anti-corruption. The\nIndex Provider relies on the assessment of a\nthird party data provider, Sustainalytics, to\ndetermine whether an issuer has violated the\nprinciples of the UNGC. To make this\ndetermination, Sustainalytics analyzes\npublicly reported allegations of adverse\nimpacts caused by businesses and provides\nassessments based on the UNGC principles,\ncategorizing those businesses as either \u201c Non-\ncompliant, \u201d \u201c Watchlist, \u201d or \u201c Compliant. \u201d\nCompanies that Sustainalytics determines are\nNon-Compliant typically are causing or\ncontributing to severe and/or systemic\nviolations of international norms and are not\nacting in accordance with the UNGC principles\nand their associated standards, conventions,\nand treaties. All companies that\nSustainalytics determines to be Non-Compliant\nare excluded from the Underlying Index.\nFurther, the Index Provider categorically\nexcludes companies that Sustainalytics has\nassigned a controversy score of 5 (indicating\nthe company experienced an event with a severe\nimpact on the environment and society), or\ncompanies which have not been assigned a\ncontroversy score. Sustainalytics assesses\ncompanies\u2019 involvement in \u201c incidents \u201d with\nnegative environmental, social, and governance\nimplications and assigns a \u201c controversy score\n\u201d , which reflects a company\u2019s level of\ninvolvement in issues and how it manages these\nissues. An incident is a company activity with\nunintended and/or undesired negative\nenvironmental and/or social impacts on\nstakeholders. 2 Incidents are primarily\nassessed based on the negative environmental\nand/or social impact of the company activity\nas well as the reputational risk that this\nactivity poses to the company and scored on a\nscale of 1 to 10. Incident scores serve as a\nguide to help Sustainalytics analysts\ndetermine the event rating. \u201c Events \u201d are\nseries of isolated or related incidents that\npertain to the same ESG issues. An event is\nassessed on a scale of 5 levels, with level 5\nbeing severe, and the assessment takes into\naccount the score of each incident comprising\nthe event to determine the event level. A \u201c\ncontroversy \u201d is an event or aggregation of\nevents relating to an ESG topic. The highest\nevent rating under a controversy indicator\nautomatically becomes the controversy score.\nAny company which receives either a\ncontroversy score of 5, or is not assessed at\nall, is excluded from the Underlying Index.\nThe Index Provider also excludes issuers from\nthe Underlying Index if they exceed any of the\nfollowing revenue and ownership thresholds: \u25a0\nover 5% of an issuer\u2019s revenue is derived from\nthermal coal extraction or generation; \u25a0 over\n5% of an issuer\u2019s revenue is derived from oil\nsands extraction; \u25a0 over 5% of an issuer\u2019s\nbusiness is involved in the retail or\ndistribution of assault or non-assault\nweapons; \u25a0 over 5% of an issuer\u2019s business is\ninvolved in the retail of tobacco products or\ntobacco related products and services; or \u25a0 an\nissuer owns over 20% of a business involved in\nantipersonnel mines, biological and chemical\nweapons, cluster weapons, depleted uranium,\nnuclear weapons, or white phosphorous. The\nIndex Provider will apply a series of revenue\nscreens on the resulting eligible\nconstituents. 3\n\nAdditional Information About the Funds' Risks\nEach Fund is subject to various risks, any of\nwhich may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV,\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Each Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. You could lose all or part of\nyour investment in a Fund, which could\nunderperform other investments. The table\nbelow identifies the principal and other (non-\nprincipal) risks that apply to each Fund. A\nFund that invests in an Underlying Fund also\nmay be indirectly exposed to these risks\nthrough such investment. A description of each\nrisk is provided after the table.\n                                              \n                    iSh\u2026         iSh\u2026         \n       iSh\u2026  iSha\u2026

nascent\ntechnologies forming the foundation of\nwireless networks that are being developed\nglobally. These technologies seek to enable\nincreases in network capacities, speeds, and\nmanagement\n\n7\n\ncapabilities and seek to enable the use of\nmillions of devices simultaneously. In the\nfuture, 5G networks aim to provide digital\ninfrastructure links between consumer devices,\nsensors, and other users. Companies across a\nwide variety of industries, primarily in the\ntechnology sector, are exploring the possible\napplications of 5G and next generation\ntechnologies. The Fund\u2019s holdings may include\nequity securities of operating companies that\nfocus on or have exposure to a wide variety of\nindustries, and the economic success of\ncertain of these companies may not be\nsignificantly tied to such technologies.\nSmaller 5G and next generation connectivity\ncompanies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel.\nThese companies may face intense competition\nand potentially rapid product obsolescence.\nThese companies may also store sensitive\nconsumer information and could be the target\nof cybersecurity attacks and other types of\ntheft, which could have a negative impact on\nthese companies. These companies may be\nsubject to additional regulatory oversight and\nmay be adversely impacted by government\nregulations. These companies may depend on\nintellectual property rights and may be\nadversely affected by the impairment of those\nrights. These companies could also be\nnegatively impacted by disruptions in service\ncaused by hardware or software failure, or by\ninterruptions or delays in service by third-\nparty data center hosting facilities and\nmaintenance providers. 5G and next generation\nconnectivity companies, especially smaller\ncompanies, may be more volatile than companies\nthat do not rely heavily on technology. The\ncustomers and suppliers of these companies may\nbe concentrated in a particular country,\nregion or industry and adverse events\noccurring in those countries, regions or\nindustries could have a negative impact on\nthese companies. Asian Economic Risk. Certain\nAsian economies have experienced rapid growth\nand industrialization in recent years, but\nthere is no assurance that this growth rate\nwill be maintained. Other Asian economies,\nhowever, have experienced high inflation, high\nunemployment, currency devaluations and\nrestrictions, and over-extension of credit.\nGeopolitical hostility, political instability,\nand economic or environmental events in any\none Asian country may have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire Asian region, as\nwell as on major trading partners outside\nAsia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets\nmay have a significant adverse effect on some\nor all of the economies of the countries in\nwhich a Fund invests. In particular, China is\na key trading partner of many Asian countries\nand any changes in trading relationships\nbetween China and other Asian countries may\naffect the region as a whole. Many Asian\ncountries are subject to political risk,\nincluding political instability, corruption\nand regional conflict with neighboring\ncountries. North Korea and South Korea each\nhave substantial military capabilities, and\nhistorical tensions between the two countries\npresent the risk of war. Escalated tensions\ninvolving the two countries and any outbreak\nof hostilities between the two countries, or\neven the threat of an outbreak of hostilities,\ncould have a severe adverse effect on the\nentire Asian region. Certain Asian countries\nhave developed increasingly strained\nrelationships with the U.S. or with China, and\nif these relations were to worsen, they could\nadversely affect Asian issuers that rely on\nthe U.S. or China for trade. In addition, many\nAsian countries are subject to social and\nlabor risks associated with demands for\nimproved political, economic and social\nconditions. These risks, among others, may\nadversely affect the value of a Fund's\ninvestments. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in a Fund\u2019s portfolio or, if\napplicable, its Underlying Index may\nunderperform in comparison to indexes that\ntrack, or assets that represent, other\ncountries or geographic units, industries,\nmarkets, market segments, or asset classes.\nVarious types of securities, other assets and\nindexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and underperformance in\ncomparison to financial markets generally.\nThis divergence may be due to a number of\nfactors including, among other things,\ninflation, interest rates, productivity,\nglobal demand for local products or resources,\nand regulation and governmental controls. This\nmay cause a Fund to underperform other\ninvestment vehicles that invest in different\nasset classes. Assets Under Management (AUM)\nRisk. From time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant, a third-party investor, a Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of a Fund\u2019s adviser, or\nanother fund may invest in a Fund and hold its\ninvestment for a specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such entity would\nnot redeem its investment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at such levels,\nwhich could negatively impact the Fund.\nAustralasian Economic Risk. The economies of\nAustralasia, which include Australia and New\nZealand, depend on exports from the energy,\nagricultural and mining sectors and, as a\nresult, are susceptible to fluctuations in the\ncommodity markets. These economies also\nincreasingly depend on their growing service\nindustries. The Australasian economies depend\non the economies of their key trading\npartners, which include China, Japan, South\nKorea, the U.S. and certain European\ncountries. Reduced spending by any of these\ntrading partners on Australasian products and\nservices, or negative changes in any of these\neconomies, may have an adverse impact on some\nor all of the Australasian economies. Economic\nevents in key trading countries can have a\nsignificant effect on the Australasian\neconomies. Other risks to Australasian\ncountries include natural disasters that may\noccur in the region (e.g., droughts,\nearthquakes, fires, tsunamis) and national or\nregional security concerns (e.g., terrorism,\nwar, strained international relations). Any\nsuch event may adversely affect the\nAustralasian economies, financial markets or\nissuers of securities, causing an adverse\nimpact on the value of a Fund\u2019s investments.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk.\nOnly an Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith a Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for a Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk may be\nheightened for a Fund that invests in\nsecurities issued by non-U.S. issuers or\ninstruments with lower trading volume. Such\nassets often entail greater settlement and\noperational complexity and higher capital\ncosts for Authorized Participants, which may\nlimit the number of Authorized Participants\nthat engage with the Fund. Automotive Sub-\nIndustry Risk. The automotive sub-industry can\nbe highly cyclical and companies in this sub-\nindustry may suffer periodic operating losses.\nCompanies in this sub-industry face intense\ncompetition, both domestically and\ninternationally, which may have an adverse 8\neffect on their profitability. The sub-\nindustry can be significantly affected by\nlabor relations, fluctuating component and\nmaterial prices, product recalls, domestic and\ninternational economic downturns and consumer\ndemands. Government regulation and increased\ncompetition may also negatively affect\nautomotive manufacturers. Some automotive\nmanufacturers are small or financially\nvulnerable and can be non-diversified in both\nproduct line and consumer base, and may be\nmore susceptible to adverse developments. The\nautomotive sub-industry is currently\nexperiencing a global semiconductor supply\nshortage, which has affected suppliers that\nincorporate semiconductors into the parts they\nsupply to customers in the automotive sub-\nindustry. As a result, companies in the\nautomotive sub-industry may experience\ndecreased sales due to lost or delayed\nproduction volume, which may in turn adversely\naffect the performance of securities of\nissuers in the automotive sub-industry.\nAutonomous Driving Sector Risk. Companies\ninvolved in, or exposed to, autonomous\ndriving-related businesses may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. Autonomous driving technology is a\nrelatively new technology and is subject to\nrisks associated with a developing industry.\nThese risks include intense competition,\ndelays or other complications in connection\nwith production, rapid product obsolescence,\nincreased government regulation and market\nvolatility. As a new technology, any product\ndefects, delays in the implementation of full\nautonomous driving or legal restrictions could\nhave an adverse effect on the businesses of\nautonomous driving companies. In addition,\ncertain autonomous driving companies are\ndependent upon the services of certain key\npersonnel and are susceptible to instability\nand volatility caused by the actions of or\nchanges to key personnel. Autonomous vehicle\ntechnology could face increasing regulatory\nscrutiny in the future, which may limit the\ndevelopment of this technology and impede the\ngrowth of companies that develop and/or\nutilize this technology. In addition, existing\nregulations that may apply to autonomous\nvehicle technology continue to rapidly change,\nwhich could adversely affect the businesses of\nautonomous driving companies. The prices of\nsecurities of companies involved in a new\nindustry may be more volatile than those in\nmore mature industries. Many companies\ninvolved in, or exposed to, autonomous\ndriving-related businesses may not be\nexclusively or substantially exposed to the\nautonomous driving sector, but may be\nsubstantially exposed to the market and\nbusiness risks of other industries or sectors,\nand the Fund may be adversely affected by\nnegative developments impacting those\ncompanies, industries or sectors. In addition,\nthese companies may be adversely affected by\nloss or impairment of intellectual property\nrights. There can be no assurance that\ncompanies involved in autonomous driving\ntechnology will be able to successfully\nprotect their intellectual property to prevent\nthe misappropriation of their technology, or\nthat competitors will not develop technology\nthat is substantially similar or superior to\nsuch companies\u2019 technology. Autonomous driving\ncompanies typically engage in significant\namounts of spending on research and\ndevelopment, and there is no guarantee that\nthe products or services produced by these\ncompanies will be successful. These companies\nare also susceptible to litigation based on\nproduct liability claims and can be\nsignificantly affected by insurance costs. In\naddition, autonomous driving companies may not\nmaintain as much insurance coverage as other\ntypes of companies and any insurance coverage\nmay not be sufficient to cover all losses or\nclaims. A loss that is uninsured or that\nexceeds policy limits may require a company to\npay substantial amounts, which could adversely\naffect the financial condition of the company.\nAutonomous driving vehicle technology\ncompanies could be adversely affected by\ncybersecurity breaches, traffic accidents\nrelated to autonomous vehicles, and other\nissues that could lead to litigation and/or\nadditional regulation. Specifically,\nautonomous driving vehicles may contain\ncomplex information technology systems\ndesigned with built-in data connectivity to\naccept and install periodic remote updates,\nwhich could be subject to risks associated\nwith the unauthorized access of and control\nover the vehicles by third parties. Any cyber-\nattack or data breach of the information\ntechnology systems could negatively affect the\nbrand, reputation and financial condition of\nthe company. Biopharmaceuticals Industry Risk.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry includes\ncompanies from each of the biotechnology,\npharmaceutical and life sciences industries.\nSuch companies are engaged in the research and\ndevelopment of a variety of products and\nservices including but not limited to products\nand services for use in internal medicine,\nvaccines, oncology, immunology, rare diseases\nand consumer healthcare. Biopharmaceutical\ncompanies may also engage in product research\nand development related to genomics, which\ngenerally refers to the use of genomic\ninformation in the provision of medical care.\nSet forth below are specific risk\nconsiderations with respect to each of the\nbiotechnology, life sciences and\npharmaceutical industries, which includes\nthose companies that could benefit from long-\nterm growth and innovation in genomics,\nimmunology and bioengineering. Such risks\ncollectively represent the risks applicable to\nthe biopharmaceutical industry. Companies in\nthe biopharmaceutical industry may be highly\nvolatile for the reasons discussed below.\nBiotechnology Industry Risk . Companies in the\nbiotechnology industry spend heavily on\nresearch and development, and their products\nor services may not prove commercially\nsuccessful or may become obsolete quickly. The\nbiotechnology industry is subject to a\nsignificant amount of governmental regulation,\nand changes in governmental policies and the\nneed for regulatory approvals may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on this industry.\nCompanies in the biotechnology industry are\nsubject to risks of new technologies and\ncompetitive pressures and are heavily\ndependent on patents and intellectual property\nrights. The loss or impairment of these rights\nmay adversely affect the profitability of\nthese companies. Pharmaceuticals Industry Risk\n. Companies in the pharmaceuticals industry\nare subject to competitive forces that may\nmake it difficult to raise prices and, in\nfact, may result in price discounting. The\nprofitability of some companies in the\npharmaceuticals industry may be dependent on a\nrelatively limited number of products. In\naddition, their products can become obsolete\ndue to industry innovation, changes in\ntechnologies or other market developments.\nMany new products in the pharmaceuticals\nindustry are subject to government approvals,\nregulation and reimbursement rates. The\nprocess of obtaining government approvals may\nbe long and costly. Many companies in the\npharmaceuticals industry are heavily dependent\non patents and intellectual property rights.\nThe loss or impairment of these rights may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. Companies in the pharmaceutical\nindustry may be subject to extensive\nlitigation based 9 on product liability and\nsimilar claims. Pharmaceutical companies may\nalso be dependent on one or more wholesalers\nfor product distribution. If a significant\npharmaceutical wholesaler should encounter\nfinancial or other difficulties, a\npharmaceutical company might be unable to\ncollect all or any of the amounts that the\nwholesaler owes such company. In addition,\nconsolidation and integration of pharmacy\nchains and wholesalers may increase\ncompetitive and pricing pressures on\npharmaceutical companies. Life Sciences\nIndustry Risk . The life sciences industry is\ncomposed primarily of companies enabling drug\ndiscovery, development and production by\nproviding analytical tools, instruments,\nconsumables and supplies, clinical trial\nservices and contract research services.\nCompanies in the life sciences industry\nprimarily service the pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology industries. The life sciences\nindustry is heavily influenced by technology,\ngovernment funding, government regulation,\nefforts by governments, healthcare providers\u2019\nand health plans\u2019 efforts to reduce costs,\nchanging consumer demographics and\nintellectual property rights, among other\nfactors. Regulations may restrict a company\u2019s\nability to pursue or use potentially\nprofitable research. The products and services\nof life sciences companies may experience\nrapid obsolescence due to a number of factors,\nincluding technological advances, supply chain\nissues or the expiration of their patents. The\nlife sciences industry is highly competitive,\nand companies in the life sciences industry\noften invest in new and uncertain innovations.\nThe success of such companies may depend upon\na relatively small number of products or\nservices with long development cycles and\nlarge capital requirements that have a high\nchance of failure. In addition, changes in\npatent protection, government approvals,\nregulations or funding, patent infringement or\nmedical litigation may adversely affect the\nvalue of such companies. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and in the return on its portfolio. A Fund\nthat borrows will incur interest expenses and\nother fees, which may reduce the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. Borrowing may also cause a Fund to\nliquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy its\nobligations. Breakthrough Innovations and New\nTechnologies Risk. Breakthrough innovations\nand new technologies are products or services\nthat fundamentally change the dynamics of an\nindustry or market. The Fund's holdings may\ninclude equity securities of operating\ncompanies that focus on or have exposure to a\nwide variety of industries, and the economic\nsuccess of certain of these companies may not\nbe significantly tied to breakthrough\ninnovations and new technologies. Companies\ninvolved in breakthrough innovations and new\ntechnologies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel that\nface intense competition and potentially rapid\nproduct obsolescence. These companies may not\nbe exclusively or substantially exposed to\nbreakthrough innovations and new technologies,\nbut may be exposed, directly or indirectly, to\nthe market and business risks of other\ncompanies, industries or sectors. In addition,\nthese companies may depend on intellectual\nproperty or patent rights to protect their\ninnovations or new technologies, which may be\ndifficult to prevent the misappropriation of,\nand are susceptible to competitors that may\ndevelop substantially similar or superior\nproducts or services. Close-Out Risk for\nQualified Financial Contracts. Regulations\nadopted by global prudential regulators\nrequire counterparties that are part of U.S.\nor foreign global systemically important\nbanking organizations to include contractual\nrestrictions on close-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified financial\ncontracts. Qualified financial contracts\ninclude agreements relating to swaps, currency\nforwards and other derivatives as well as\nrepurchase agreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions prevent a Fund\nfrom closing out a qualified financial\ncontract during a specified time period if the\ncounterparty is subject to resolution\nproceedings and also prohibit a Fund from\nexercising default rights due to a\nreceivership or similar proceeding of an\naffiliate of the counterparty. These\nrequirements may increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. Cloud-based Computing\nand Data Storage Risk. Companies involved in,\nor exposed to, cloud-based computing and data\nstorage-related businesses may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. These companies face intense\ncompetition and potentially rapid product\nobsolescence, and many depend on retaining and\ngrowing the consumer base of their respective\nproducts and services. These companies may not\nbe exclusively or substantially exposed to\ncloud-based computing and data storage-related\nbusinesses (as determined by the Index\nProvider), but may be exposed, directly or\nindirectly, to the market and business risks\nof other companies, industries or sectors, and\nthe Fund may be adversely affected by negative\ndevelopments impacting those other companies,\nindustries or sectors. These companies may\ndepend on intellectual property rights and may\nbe adversely affected by loss or impairment of\nthose rights. There can be no assurance that\ncompanies involved in cloud-based computing\nand data storage will be able to successfully\nprotect their intellectual property to prevent\nthe misappropriation of their technology, or\nthat competitors will not develop technology\nthat is substantially similar or superior.\nCloud-based computing and data storage\ncompanies also depend on a number of third\nparties to provide services to data centers,\nwhich, if interrupted, may impact products and\nservices. These companies are also potential\ntargets for cyberattacks, which may have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the performance\nof these companies. These companies may also\nbe affected by prolonged power outages or\nshortages, increased costs of energy, or\ngeneral lack of availability of electrical\nsources. Cloud-based computing and data\nstorage companies, especially smaller\ncompanies, may be more volatile than companies\nnot in the technology sector. Legal and\nregulatory changes, particularly related to\ninformation privacy and data protection, may\nimpact the products or services of cloud-based\ncomputing and data storage companies. Cloud-\nbased computing may face increasing regulatory\nscrutiny and legal liability, which may limit\nthe development of this technology and impede\nthe growth of companies that develop or use\nthis technology. Similarly, the collection of\ndata from consumers and other sources, and\nstorage of that data, may face increased\nscrutiny as regulators consider how data may\nbe collected, stored, safeguarded and used. In\nthe event of a data breach or a similar\nincident, cloud-based computing and data\nstorage companies may face legal liability. 10\nCommunication Services Sector Risk. The\ncommunication services sector consists of both\ncompanies in the telecommunication services\nindustry as well as those in the media and\nentertainment industry. Examples of companies\nin the telecommunication services industry\ngroup include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-\nline, cellular and wireless telecommunications\nnetworks. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industry group encompass a\nvariety of services and products including\ntelevision broadcasting, gaming products,\nsocial media, networking platforms, online\nclassifieds, online review websites, and\nInternet search engines. Companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be affected\nby industry competition, substantial capital\nrequirements, government regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications products and\nservices due to technological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and international demand,\nshifting demographics and often unpredictable\nchanges in consumer tastes can drastically\naffect a communication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Concentration Risk. A Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. A Fund with investment concentration\nmay be more adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets, may\nexperience greater price volatility and may be\nmore susceptible to adverse economic, market,\npolitical or regulatory impacts on those\nassets compared to a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments. Consumer Goods\nand Services Companies Risk. Many consumer\ngoods and services companies ( \u201c consumer\ncompanies \u201d ) rely heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending and may\nbe impacted by social trends, marketing\ncampaigns, demographic shifts and other\nfactors affecting consumer preferences and\ndemand. In addition, damage to a brand or a\nreputation crisis can have a substantial\nadverse impact on consumer companies. Certain\nconsumer companies, such as those providing\ndiscretionary goods or services, may depend\nmore on business cycles, overall economic\nconditions and consumer confidence. Many\nconsumer goods and services are subject to\ngovernment regulation and the related\ncompliance costs, and consumer companies also\nface the risk of product liability claims.\nConsumer companies also may be adversely\naffected by volatility in commodity prices,\nsupply chain disruptions and labor shortages.\nCurrency Risk. Because each Fund\u2019s NAV is\ndetermined on the basis of the U.S. dollar,\ninvestors may lose money if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which a Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on repatriation of\nforeign currency, even if the foreign currency\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s holdings in that market\nincreases. Currency exchange rates can be very\nvolatile and can change quickly and\nunpredictably. As a result, a Fund\u2019s NAV may\nchange quickly and without warning. In\naddition, a Fund may incur costs in connection\nwith conversions between U.S. dollars and\nforeign currencies. Custody Risk. Custody risk\nrefers to the risks in the process of clearing\nand settling trades, as well as the holding of\nsecurities and other assets by local banks,\nagents and depositories. These risks are\nheightened in jurisdictions with less\ndeveloped markets or less robust settlement\nand custody infrastructure and processes, and\nthey may result in losses or delays in\npayments, delivery or recovery of money or 11\nother assets. Low trading volumes and volatile\nprices in less developed markets may make\ntrades harder to complete and settle.\nGovernments or trade groups may compel local\nagents to hold securities and other assets in\ndesignated depositories that may not be\nsubject to independent evaluation. Local\nagents are held only to the standards of care\nof their local markets. In general, the less\ndeveloped a country\u2019s securities markets are,\nthe higher the degree of custody risk.\nCybersecurity Risk. A Fund and entities that\ninteract with the Fund are susceptible to\noperational, information security and related\ncybersecurity risks, both directly and through\ntheir service providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, distributor, other service providers\n( e.g ., index and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer agents and\nadministrators), counterparties, market\nmakers, Authorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market operators,\nand governmental authorities. Cybersecurity\nrisks are also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in which a Fund\ninvests, which could result in material\nadverse consequences for such issuers and may\ncause the Fund\u2019s investment in such issuers to\nlose value. Cyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or unintentional events.\nThey include, but are not limited to, gaining\nunauthorized access to systems,\nmisappropriating assets or sensitive\ninformation, corrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational disruption.\nGeopolitical tensions may increase the scale\nand sophistication of deliberate attacks,\nparticularly those from nation-states or from\nentities with nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions\nand impact business operations and may result\nin any of the following: financial losses,\ninterference with a Fund\u2019s ability to\ncalculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to trading,\nsubmission of erroneous trades or erroneous\ncreation or redemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service providers to transact\nbusiness, violations of applicable privacy and\nother laws, regulatory fines, penalties,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other legal and\ncompliance expenses. In addition, cyber\nincidents may render records of Fund assets\nand transactions, shareholder ownership of\nFund shares, and other data integral to a\nFund\u2019s functioning inaccessible, inaccurate or\nincomplete. A Fund may incur substantial costs\nin order to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. Each Fund has established business\ncontinuity plans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent, cyber\nincidents. However, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that prevention and\nremediation efforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go undetected.\nFurthermore, a Fund cannot control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and other third\nparties whose activities affect the Fund. A\nFund and its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk. Investing in dividend-paying stocks\ninvolves the risk that such stocks may fall\nout of favor with investors and underperform\nother types of stocks or the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of dividend-paying stocks will not\ndeclare dividends in the future or will reduce\nor eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends), which may adversely affect a Fund\nwith such holdings. In addition, the value of\ndividend-paying stocks can decline when\ninterest rates rise, as fixed-income\ninvestments become more attractive to\ninvestors. Electric Vehicles Sector Risk.\nCompanies involved in, or exposed to, electric\nvehicles-related businesses may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. Electric vehicle technology is a\nrelatively new technology and is subject to\nrisks associated with a developing industry.\nThese risks include intense competition,\ndelays or other complications in connection\nwith production, rapid product obsolescence,\nincreased government regulation and market\nvolatility. In addition, certain electric\nvehicle companies are dependent upon the\nservices of certain key personnel and are\nsusceptible to instability and volatility\ncaused by the actions of or changes to key\npersonnel. The prices of securities of\ncompanies involved in a new industry may be\nmore volatile than those in more mature\nindustries. Many companies involved in, or\nexposed to, electric vehicles-related\nbusinesses depend significantly on retaining\nand growing the consumer base of their\nrespective products and services. Such\ncompanies may not be exclusively or\nsubstantially exposed to the electric vehicles\nsector, but may be substantially exposed to\nthe market and business risks of other\nindustries or sectors, and the Fund may be\nadversely affected by negative developments\nimpacting those companies, industries or\nsectors. Electric vehicle companies currently\nbenefit from certain government subsidiaries,\npolicies and economic incentives, which may be\nreduced or eliminated in the future. In\naddition, these companies may be adversely\naffected by loss or impairment of intellectual\nproperty rights. There can be no assurance\nthat companies involved in electric vehicle\ntechnology will be able to successfully\nprotect their intellectual property to prevent\nthe misappropriation of their technology, or\nthat competitors will not develop technology\nthat is substantially similar or superior to\nsuch companies\u2019 technology. Electric vehicle\ncompanies typically engage in significant\namounts of spending on research and\ndevelopment, and there is no guarantee that\nthe products or services produced by these\ncompanies will be successful. These companies\nare also susceptible to litigation based on\nproduct liability claims and can be\nsignificantly affected by insurance costs. In\naddition, electric vehicle companies may not\nmaintain as much insurance coverage as other\ntypes of companies and any insurance coverage\nmay not be sufficient to cover all losses or\nclaims. A loss that is uninsured or that\nexceeds policy limits may require a company to\npay substantial amounts, which could adversely\naffect the financial condition of the company.\nElectric driving vehicle technology companies\ncould be adversely affected by cybersecurity\nbreaches, traffic accidents related to\nautonomous vehicles, and other issues that\ncould lead to litigation and/or additional\nregulation. Specifically, electric vehicles\nmay contain complex information technology\nsystems designed with built-in data\nconnectivity to accept and install periodic\nremote updates, which could be subject to\nrisks associated with the unauthorized access\nof and control over the vehicles by third\nparties. Any cyber-attack or data breach of\nthe information technology systems could\nnegatively affect the brand, reputation and\nfinancial condition of the company. 12\nCompanies involved in the production of\nbatteries for electric vehicles are subject to\nthe effects of price fluctuations of\ntraditional and alternative sources of energy,\ndevelopments in battery and alternative energy\ntechnology and the possibility that government\nsubsidies for, or policies encouraging the use\nof, alternative energy sources will change or\nbe eliminated. Lithium-ion battery cells,\nwhich are used in electric vehicles, have been\nobserved to catch fire or vent smoke and\nflame, which have raised concerns and may lead\nto litigation, product recalls or redesign\nefforts. Energy Companies Risk. The energy\nsector tends to be closely tied to the\neconomic cycle and can be significantly\naffected by supply-demand dynamics and\nvolatility in commodity prices. Energy\ncompanies also may be adversely affected by\nexchange rate fluctuations, war or other\nconflicts, sanctions, import/export controls,\ndepletion of resources, technological advances\nand labor relations. This sector generally is\nsubject to substantial government regulation,\nand companies may incur significant costs in\ncomplying with environmental and other laws.\nPolicies that promote energy conservation,\nclean energy or the transition to low carbon\nalternatives also may affect the performance\nof energy companies. Energy companies may\ndepend on a relatively small number of\ncustomers, including governmental entities and\nutilities. The exploration and production of\nenergy sources and the development of energy\ninfrastructure often require significant\ncapital expenditures, and companies may face\nhigh interest costs and difficulty in raising\ncapital. Energy companies also may face\nchallenges from operating in countries with a\nhistory of adverse policies or events, such as\nexpropriation, confiscation of assets,\ncorruption, political instability and social\nunrest. The operations of energy companies may\nbe disrupted by events that target or damage\nenergy infrastructure, including cyber or\nother attacks, accidents and natural\ndisasters. Energy companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. The energy sector may\nexperience significant market volatility. For\nexample, Russia\u2019s large-scale invasion of\nUkraine in 2022 led to disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nimposed various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. It is impossible to predict the\neffect of current or future sanctions and\nrestrictions, the extent and duration of the\nconflict, and associated disruptions in the\nenergy sector. The effect of these events or\nany related developments could be significant\nand may have a severe adverse effect on a\nFund\u2019s performance. Energy Storage Solutions\nSector Risk. The market value of securities in\nthe energy storage solutions sector may\ndecline for the following reasons, among\nothers: changes in and volatility of\ntraditional and alternative energy prices,\nenergy supply and demand, government\nregulation and intervention, trade treaties,\nexchange rates, interest rates, tax treatment,\nenergy conservation efforts, availability of\ncertain inputs and materials required for\nproduction, depletion of resources,\ntechnological developments, labor relations,\ncosts related to exploration, mining, and\nproduction, and general economic conditions.\nRisks associated with hazardous materials,\nliability from accidents resulting in injury\nor loss of life or property, pollution or\nother environmental problems, equipment\nmalfunctions or mishandling of materials and\nterrorism, cyber incidents, political strife\nor natural disasters may also significantly\naffect this sector. Companies in the energy\nstorage solutions sector, including, but not\nlimited to, battery, fuel cell, and hydrogen\ncompanies, may depend largely on the\navailability of hydrogen gas, certain third-\nparty key suppliers for components in their\nproducts, and a small number of customers for\na significant portion of their business.\nBecause lithium, hydrogen, copper, aluminum,\nsteel and other raw materials are often\ncritical components of the products\nmanufactured by these companies, fluctuations\nin prices, and in commodities prices, as\napplicable, for such raw materials may impact\ntheir profitability. Companies in the energy\nstorage solutions sector may also operate in,\nor engage in transactions involving, countries\nthat have less developed regulatory regimes or\na history of expropriation, confiscation of\nassets, foreign investment restrictions,\nnationalization or other adverse policies or\nthat are at greater risk of political and\nsocial unrest, coups or labor disruptions. The\nenergy storage solutions sector may also be\nsignificantly affected by changes in\ngovernmental regulations and policies, such as\nsubsidies and tax incentives, including the\npossibility that government subsidies and/or\ntax incentives for alternative energy will be\neliminated. Equity Securities Risk. Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value due\nto general market or economic conditions,\nperceptions about the markets in which issuers\nparticipate or a number of factors relating to\na specific issuer. Investments in equity\nsecurities may be more volatile than\ninvestments in other asset classes. Equity\nsecurities (both common and preferred stock)\nare subordinated to debt securities in a\ncompany\u2019s capital structure, and so equity\nholders are generally subject to more risks,\nparticularly in the event of an issuer\u2019s\nbankruptcy. Common stock has the lowest\npriority and the greatest risks, including\nwith respect to dividends and any liquidation\npayments. ESG Risk. To the extent that a\nFund\u2019s Underlying Index uses criteria related\nto the ESG characteristics of issuers, this\nmay limit the types and number of investment\nopportunities available to the Fund and, as a\nresult, the Fund may underperform other funds\nwhose underlying index does not use ESG\ncriteria. An Underlying Index\u2019s use of ESG\ncriteria may result in a Fund investing in, or\nallocating greater weight to, securities or\nmarket sectors that underperform the market as\na whole or underperform other funds that use\nESG criteria. In addition, the use of\nrepresentative sampling may result in the\ndivergence of a Fund's overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. An Index Provider evaluates\nsecurities for inclusion and/or weighting in\nsuch an Underlying Index based on ESG criteria\nand data provided by the Index Provider or\nthird parties. The Index Provider\u2019s evaluation\nof securities\u2019 ESG characteristics depends on\nthese criteria and data, which may vary by\nindex provider, and no assurance can be given\nthat they will be complete, accurate or\ncurrent. In addition, an Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data (including\nratings) and, if applicable, ESG objectives or\nconstraints that are relevant to an Underlying\nIndex only at index reviews or rebalances.\nSecurities included in an Underlying Index may\ncease to meet the relevant ESG criteria 13 but\nmay nevertheless remain in the Underlying\nIndex and in the Fund using the Underlying\nIndex until the next review or rebalance by\nthe Index Provider. As a result, certain\nsecurities in the Underlying Index, or the\nUnderlying Index as a whole, may not meet the\nrelevant ESG objectives or constraints at all\ntimes. If the ESG assessment of a security in\nan Underlying Index or a Fund changes, neither\nthe Fund nor BFA accepts any liability in\nrelation to such change. BFA does not monitor\nsecurities in an Underlying Index with respect\nto ESG objectives or constraints applied by\nthe Index Provider and is not responsible for\nchanges to the ESG assessment of a security in\nan Underlying Index between rebalances. In\naddition, BFA does not assess the validity of\nan Index Provider\u2019s evaluation of the ESG\ncharacteristics of securities or the criteria\nand data used in such evaluation. The impacts\nof risks related to ESG investing are likely\nto change over time, and new ESG risks may be\nidentified as further data and information\nregarding ESG factors and impacts become\navailable. In addition, methodologies for ESG\ninvesting continue to develop, and the ESG\nmethodology applied by an Index Provider may\nchange over time. European Economic Risk. The\nEconomic and Monetary Union (the \u201c eurozone \u201d\n) of the European Union (the \u201c EU \u201d ) requires\ncompliance by member states that are members\nof the eurozone with restrictions on inflation\nrates, deficits, interest rates and debt\nlevels, as well as fiscal and monetary\ncontrols, each of which may significantly\naffect every country in Europe, including\nthose countries that are not members of the\neurozone. Additionally, European countries\noutside of the eurozone may present economic\nrisks that are independent of the indirect\neffects that eurozone policies have on them.\nIn particular, the United Kingdom's (the \u201c\nU.K. \u201d ) economy may be affected by global\neconomic, industrial and financial shifts.\nChanges in imports or exports, changes in\ngovernmental or EU regulations on trade,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro (the\ncommon currency of eurozone countries), the\ndefault or threat of default by an EU member\nstate on its sovereign debt and/or an economic\nrecession in an EU member state may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on the economies of\nother EU member states and their trading\npartners. The European financial markets have\nhistorically experienced volatility and\nadverse trends due to concerns about economic\ndownturns or government debt levels in several\nEuropean countries, including, but not limited\nto, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.\nThese events have affected and may in the\nfuture adversely affect the exchange rate of\nthe euro and may significantly affect European\ncountries. Responses to financial problems by\nEuropean governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the desired results,\nmay result in social unrest, may limit future\ngrowth and economic recovery or may have other\nunintended consequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and other\nentities of their debt could have additional\nadverse effects on economies, financial\nmarkets and asset valuations around the world.\nIn addition, one or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K.\nleft the EU ( \u201c Brexit \u201d ) on January 31,\n2020. Brexit could adversely affect European\nor worldwide political, regulatory, economic\nor market conditions and could contribute to\ninstability in global political institutions,\nregulatory agencies and financial markets. The\nnational politics of countries in Europe have\nbeen unpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding, for example, secessionist\nmovements. The governments of European\ncountries may be subject to change and such\ncountries may experience social and political\nunrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or\nsocial developments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region could also impact financial\nmarkets. The impact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of a Fund's investments. Russian\nInvasion of Ukraine . Russia launched a large-\nscale invasion of Ukraine on February 24,\n2022. The extent and duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and resulting\nfuture market disruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the value of the\nruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible\nto predict, but could be significant.\nDisruptions caused by Russian military action\nor other actions (including cyberattacks and\nespionage) or resulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity, including\npurchasing and financing restrictions,\nboycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser\npreferences, sanctions, import and export\nrestrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian companies or\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nmay impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which a Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Exponential Technologies Risk .\nTechnologies perceived to displace older\ntechnologies or create new markets may not in\nfact do so. Companies that initially develop a\nnovel technology may not be able to capitalize\non the technology. Companies that develop\nexponential technologies may face political or\nlegal attacks from competitors, industry\ngroups or local and national governments.\nThese companies may also be exposed to risks\napplicable to sectors other than the\nexponential technology theme for which they\nare chosen, and the securities issued by these\ncompanies may underperform the securities of\nother companies that are primarily focused on\na particular theme. The Fund may invest in a\ncompany that does not currently derive any\nrevenue from exponential technologies, and\nthere is no assurance that a company will\nderive any revenue from exponential\ntechnologies in the future. An exponential\ntechnology may constitute a small portion of a\ncompany\u2019s overall business. As a result, the\nsuccess of an exponential technology may not\naffect the value of the equity securities\nissued by the company. Financial Companies\nRisk. Financial services companies are subject\nto extensive governmental regulation and\nintervention, which may change frequently and\nmay adversely affect their profitability, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and liquid\nassets they must maintain and their size,\namong other things. Financial services\ncompanies also may be significantly affected\nby, among other things, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, credit rating downgrades,\nadverse public perception and exposure\nconcentration. 14 Increased risk-taking by\nfinancial companies may result in greater\noverall risk in the global financial sector.\nCertain events may cause an unusually high\ndegree of volatility in financial markets and\npose the risk of large losses for financial\nservices companies. Financial companies\nfrequently operate with substantial financial\nleverage and are exposed directly to the\ncredit risk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, which also may be leveraged to\nan unknown degree. Financial companies may\nhave significant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties; as a result, a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother financial companies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk may result in\nsignificant negative impacts to companies with\ndirect exposure to the defaulting counterparty\nas well as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financial sector generally.\nFinTech Risk. Companies developing financial\ntechnologies or using technology-enabled\ninnovation in the financial services industry\n( \u201c FinTech Companies \u201d ) could result in new\nbusiness models, applications, processes or\nproducts with an associated effect on the\nprovision of financial services. FinTech\nCompanies may seek to disrupt or displace\nestablished financial institutions and may\nface competition from larger and more\nestablished companies. FinTech Companies may\nnot be able to capitalize on their disruptive\ntechnologies when facing political and/or\nlegal attacks from competitors, industry\ngroups or local and national governments.\nThese companies may depend on intellectual\nproperty rights and may be adversely affected\nby loss or impairment of those rights. Many\nFintech Companies are not currently\nprofitable, and there can be no assurance that\nthese companies will be profitable in the\nfuture. Additionally, FinTech Companies may be\nadversely impacted by potential rapid product\nobsolescence, cybersecurity attacks and\ndisruptions in the technology they depend on.\nLegal and regulatory changes, particularly\nrelated to information privacy and data\nprotection, may impact the products or\nservices of FinTech Companies. Laws and\nregulations typically vary by state and by\ncountry, which may create challenges for\nFinTech Companies to achieve scale. Increasing\nregulatory scrutiny and legal liability may\nlimit the development and impede the growth of\nthese companies. Similarly, the collection and\nstorage of data from consumers and other\nsources may face increased scrutiny as\nregulators consider how data may be collected,\nstored, safeguarded and used. Further, in the\nevent of a data breach or a similar incident,\nFinTech Companies may face legal liability.\nGeographic and Security Risks. Issuers in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio may be located in, or\notherwise connected to, parts of the world\naffected by natural disasters, such as severe\nheat, earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic\neruptions, wildfires, droughts, floods,\nhurricanes and tsunamis. In addition, issuers\nmay be impacted by security concerns with\nrespect to a country or region, such as war\nand other types of conflict, terrorism,\nstrained international relations and\nterritorial disputes. Any of these events may\nadversely affect the issuers, markets and\neconomies to which a Fund is exposed, which\nmay adversely affect the value of the Fund.\nHealthcare Companies Risk. The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by the following factors, among\nothers: extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, a\nlimited number of products, labor shortages,\nsupply chain issues and industry innovation.\nMany new products in the healthcare sector\nentail significant research and development\nand require regulatory approval, all of which\nmay be long and costly, and such efforts\nultimately may be unsuccessful. Many\nhealthcare companies depend heavily on\nobtaining and defending patents, which can be\ncostly, and may be adversely affected by the\nexpiration of patents. Healthcare companies\nalso are subject to extensive litigation based\non product liability and similar claims.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nAn investment may be illiquid due to, among\nother things, fewer participants or less\ncapacity to make a market in the investment,\nthe lack of an active market for the\ninvestment, capital controls, delays or limits\non repatriation of local currency, and the\ninsolvency of local governments. To the extent\nthat a Fund invests in securities or other\nassets with substantial market and/or credit\nrisk, the Fund will tend to have increased\nexposure to the risks associated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid investments may be\nharder to value, especially in changing\nmarkets. Liquid investments may become\nilliquid after purchase by a Fund,\nparticularly during periods of market turmoil.\nThere can be no assurance that a security or\nother asset that is deemed to be liquid when\npurchased will continue to be liquid for as\nlong as it is held by a Fund, and any security\nor other asset held by a Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk management program. Holdings of\nilliquid investments may reduce a Fund\u2019s\nreturns because the Fund may be unable to\ntransact at advantageous times or prices. If a\nFund is forced to sell underlying investments\nat reduced prices or under unfavorable\nconditions to meet redemption requests or for\nother cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss.\nThis may be magnified in a rising interest\nrate environment or other circumstances where\nredemptions of Fund shares may be greater than\nnormal. If other market participants attempt\nto liquidate holdings at the same time as a\nFund, this will lead to an increased supply of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying investments in the\nmarket and contribute to greater illiquid\ninvestments risk and downward pricing\npressure. In addition, if a Fund is limited in\nits ability to sell illiquid investments\nduring periods when shareholders are redeeming\ntheir shares, the Fund will need to sell\nliquid securities to meet redemption requests,\nand illiquid securities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings. During periods\nof market volatility, liquidity in the market\nfor a Fund\u2019s shares may be impacted by the\nliquidity in the market for the underlying\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund,\nwhich could lead to the Fund\u2019s shares trading\nat a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.\nIndex-Related Risk. A Fund that tracks an\nUnderlying Index seeks to achieve a return\nthat corresponds generally to the price and\nyield performance, before fees and expenses,\nof its Underlying Index as published by the\nIndex Provider. There is no assurance that the\nIndex Provider or its agents will construct or\ncalculate the Underlying Index accurately.\nWhile the Index Provider describes what the\nUnderlying 15 Index is designed to achieve,\nneither the Index Provider nor its agents\nprovide any warranty or accept any liability\nregarding the quality, accuracy or\ncompleteness of the Underlying Index or its\nrelated data, and they do not guarantee that\nthe Underlying Index will be in line with the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology. BFA also does\nnot provide any warranty or guarantee against\nthe Index Provider\u2019s or any agent\u2019s errors.\nThe Index Provider may rely on various sources\nof information to assess the criteria of\ncomponents of the Underlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on assumptions\nand estimates. Neither a Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology or sources of information will\nprovide an accurate assessment of included\ncomponents or will result in the Fund meeting\nits investment objective. Errors in index\ndata, index computations or the construction\nof an Underlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, particularly for indexes that are less\ncommonly used as benchmarks. In addition,\nthere may be heightened risks associated with\nthe adequacy and reliability of information\nabout emerging markets constituents, as such\nmarkets may have less information available or\nless regulatory oversight. Errors related to\nan Underlying Index may negatively or\npositively impact a Fund and its shareholders.\nFor example, if the Underlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund will have\nexposure to such constituents and will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying Index\u2019s other\nconstituents. Shareholders should understand\nthat any gains from an Index Provider\u2019s errors\nwill be kept by the Fund and its shareholders\nand any losses or costs from such errors will\nbe borne by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnusual market conditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural disasters,\npolitical unrest or war) may impact an Index\nProvider or a third-party data provider and\ncould cause the Index Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to an Underlying Index.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. If a\nscheduled rebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that would otherwise be removed\nat the rebalance (due to, for example, changes\nin market capitalization or issuer credit\nratings) may remain, causing the performance\nand constituents of the Underlying Index to\nvary from those expected under normal\nconditions. In addition, to the extent\ncircumstances evolve between periodic index\nreviews and reconstitutions, an Underlying\nIndex may include constituents that do not\nalign with its objective or selection\ncriteria, and the Fund tracking the Underlying\nIndex may be similarly affected. In addition\nto scheduled rebalances, an Index Provider or\nits agents may carry out ad hoc index\nrebalances due to reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market conditions,\ncorporate events, or corrections of errors.\nThe relevant Fund will in turn rebalance its\nportfolio to attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the portfolio and the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund and its\nshareholders will directly bear any\ntransaction costs and market exposure from\nsuch portfolio rebalancing. Therefore, index-\nrelated errors and ad hoc rebalances may\nincrease a Fund\u2019s costs and tracking error.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, third-party vendor\nrisks, cyber attacks, trade disputes, product\nrecalls, liability and environmental damage\nclaims, scarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe products of industrial companies may face\nobsolescence due to technological developments\nand new product introduction. Furthermore,\nchanges in trade restrictions and tariffs as\nwell as broader geopolitical developments\ncould adversely affect industrial companies.\nThese companies also may be significantly\naffected by domestic and international\neconomic conditions, legislative and\nregulatory changes, and labor relations.\nIndustrial companies may depend on public or\nprivate sector financing, which may become\ndifficult to obtain due to government spending\nconstraints or reduced availability of\ncapital. Such companies may be unable to\nprotect their intellectual property rights or\nmay be liable for infringing the intellectual\nproperty rights of others. Issuer Risk. The\nperformance of a Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of a\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or loan Fund\nshares (to secure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party. There can be no\nassurance that any large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment or that the size of a Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares may adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the extent a Fund\npermits redemptions in cash, these redemptions\nmay force the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material effect on the\nmarket price of Fund shares, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains, and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such tax year. A\nFund also may be required to sell its more\nliquid investments to meet a large redemption,\nin which case the Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile, and more\ndifficult to price. 16 To the extent these\nlarge shareholders transact in Fund shares on\nthe secondary market, such transactions may\naccount for a large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may, therefore,\nhave a material upward or downward effect on\nthe market price of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s performance to the extent\nthat the Fund is delayed in investing new cash\nand is required to maintain a larger cash\nposition than it ordinarily would, diluting\nits investment returns. Management Risk. An\nindex Fund invests in securities or other\nassets included in, or representative of, its\nUnderlying Index, regardless of their\ninvestment merits. Such a Fund may be affected\nby a general decline in market segments\nrelated to its Underlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to invest the\nFund\u2019s assets in defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. Market disruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an adverse effect on a\nFund\u2019s ability to adjust its exposure to the\nrequired levels in order to track its\nUnderlying Index. Because BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy, a\nFund will not fully replicate its Underlying\nIndex and may hold securities or other assets\nnot included in the Underlying Index. As a\nresult, a Fund is subject to the risk that\nBFA\u2019s investment strategy, whose\nimplementation is subject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the intended\nresults. There is no guarantee that a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a high degree of\ncorrelation to those of its Underlying Index\nor that a Fund will achieve its investment\nobjective. Market Risk. A Fund could lose\nmoney over short periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over longer periods\nduring more prolonged market downturns. The\nvalue of a financial instrument or other asset\nmay decline due to changes in general market\nconditions, economic trends or events that are\nnot specifically related to the particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors that affect\none or more issuers, counterparties,\nexchanges, countries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or asset classes.\nLocal, regional or global events such as war,\nacts of terrorism, pandemics or other public\nhealth issues, recessions, the prospect or\noccurrence of a sovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments and could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s NAV. Changes\nin market and economic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all types of\ninstruments and assets. Market Trading Risk. A\nFund faces numerous market trading risks, any\nof which may lead to its shares trading in the\nsecondary market at a premium or discount to\nNAV or to the intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy Fund shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto NAV or sell Fund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a discount to the NAV, you\nmay pay significantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the underlying value\nof the Fund shares. Absence of an Active\nPrimary Market. Although Fund shares are\nlisted for trading on one or more stock\nexchanges, there can be no assurance that an\nactive primary trading market for Fund shares\nwill develop or be maintained by market makers\nor Authorized Participants. Secondary Listing\nRisks. A Fund\u2019s shares may be listed or traded\non U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other\nthan the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing is maintained. Fund shares\nalso may be available to non-U.S. investors\nthrough funds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary receipts. There\ncan be no assurance that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to trade on any such stock exchange\nor in any market or that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to meet the requirements for exchange\nlisting or market trading. A Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe less actively traded in certain markets\nthan in others, and investors are subject to\nthe execution and settlement risks and market\nstandards of the market where they or their\nbroker direct their trades for execution.\nCertain information that is available to\ninvestors who trade Fund shares on a U.S.\nstock exchange during regular U.S. market\nhours may not be available to investors who\ntrade in other markets, which may result in\nsecondary market prices in such markets being\nless efficient. Secondary Market Trading Risk.\nShares of a Fund may trade in the secondary\nmarket at times when the Fund does not accept\norders to create or redeem shares. At such\ntimes, shares may trade in the secondary\nmarket with more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might be experienced at\ntimes when the Fund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities held by a Fund\nmay be traded in markets that close at a\ndifferent time than an exchange on which Fund\nshares are traded. Liquidity in those\nsecurities may be reduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during the time\nwhen the exchange is open but after the\napplicable market closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be wider bid/ask\nspreads on the exchange and a greater premium\nor discount to NAV. In stressed market\nconditions, the market for a Fund\u2019s shares may\nbecome less liquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the markets for the\nFund\u2019s portfolio holdings, and an investor may\nbe unable to sell their Fund shares. Secondary\nmarket trading in Fund shares may be halted by\na stock exchange because of market conditions\nor for other reasons. In times of\nextraordinary market volatility, Fund shares\nmay be subject to trading halts pursuant to \u201c\ncircuit breaker \u201d rules of a stock exchange or\nmarket. If there is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an exchange or\nmarket, an investor may be unable to purchase\nor sell Fund shares. In addition, if trading\nin certain securities or financial instruments\nis restricted, this may disrupt a Fund\u2019s\ncreation/redemption process, affect the price\nat which Fund shares trade in the secondary\nmarket, and result in a Fund being unable to\ntrade certain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such circumstances, a Fund may\nbe unable to rebalance its portfolio or\naccurately price its portfolio holdings and\nmay incur substantial trading losses. Shares\nof a Fund, similar to shares of other issuers\nlisted on a stock exchange, may be sold short\nand are therefore subject to the risk of\nincreased volatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short. In addition,\ntrading activity in derivative products based\non a Fund may lead to increased trading volume\nand volatility in the secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares May Trade at\nPrices Other Than NAV . Shares of a Fund trade\non stock exchanges at prices at, above or\nbelow the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. A Fund\u2019s NAV\nis calculated at the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in the market\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s 17 portfolio holdings. The\ntrading price of a Fund\u2019s shares fluctuates\nthroughout trading hours based on both market\nsupply of and demand for Fund shares and the\nunderlying value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the trading\nprices of a Fund\u2019s shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant redemption requests,\nor other unusual market conditions However,\nbecause Fund shares can be created and\nredeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or premiums to a\nFund\u2019s NAV are not likely to be sustained over\nthe long term (unlike shares of many closed-\nend funds, which frequently trade at\nappreciable discounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While the\ncreation/redemption feature is designed to\nmake it more likely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock exchanges at\nprices close to the Fund\u2019s next calculated\nNAV, exchange prices are not expected to\ncorrelate exactly with the Fund\u2019s NAV due to\ntiming reasons, supply and demand imbalances\nand other factors. In addition, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers, Authorized\nParticipants, or other market participants,\nand during periods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading prices for\nshares of a Fund that differ significantly\nfrom its NAV. Authorized Participants may be\nless willing to create or redeem a Fund\u2019s\nshares if there is a lack of an active market\nfor such shares or the Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments, which may contribute to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or Selling Fund\nShares. Buying or selling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of costs that\napply to all securities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you will likely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is\nthe difference between what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares (the \u201c bid \u201d\nprice) and the price at which they are willing\nto sell Fund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price). The\nspread varies over time for Fund shares based\non trading volume and market liquidity. It is\ngenerally narrower if a Fund has more trading\nvolume and market liquidity and wider if a\nFund has less trading volume and market\nliquidity. Increased market volatility also\nmay cause wider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other charges that are\nincurred as a result of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in buying or\nselling Fund shares, frequent trading may\ndetract significantly from investment results,\nand an investment in Fund shares may not be\nadvisable for investors who anticipate\nregularly making small investments through a\nbrokerage account. Materials Companies Risk.\nThe materials sector tends to be closely tied\nto the economic cycle and can be significantly\naffected by supply-demand dynamics. Materials\ncompanies may be adversely affected by\ncommodity price volatility, exchange rate\nfluctuations, social and political unrest,\nwar, import and export controls, supply chain\ndisruption, increased competition, depletion\nof resources, technical advances, labor\nrelations, litigation and government\nregulations, among other factors. Materials\ncompanies are at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may incur significant costs in\ncomplying with environmental laws. Media Sub-\nIndustry Risk. Companies in the media sub-\nindustry may encounter distressed cash flows\ndue to the need to commit substantial capital\nto meet increasing competition, particularly\nin formulating new products and services using\nnew technology. Media companies are subject to\nrisks that include cyclicality of revenues and\nearnings, a potential decrease in the\ndiscretionary income of targeted individuals,\nchanging consumer tastes and interests,\ncompetition in the industry and the potential\nfor increased state and federal regulation.\nAdvertising spending is an important source of\nrevenue for media companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and as a result, media companies\ntend to generate less revenue. Mid-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Investments in\nmid-capitalization companies may be riskier,\nless liquid, more volatile and more\nsusceptible to economic, market and industry\nchanges than investments in large-\ncapitalization companies. Mid-capitalization\ncompanies may have more limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources and management\nexperience. As a result, they generally are\nmore vulnerable than large-capitalization\ncompanies to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Mid-capitalization companies may\nhave a shorter business track record, with\nrelatively less information available to\ninvestors. The securities of mid-sized\ncompanies may trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than the securities of larger\ncompanies. Middle Eastern Economic Risk. Many\nMiddle Eastern countries have little or no\ndemocratic tradition, and the political and\nlegal systems in such countries may adversely\nimpact the companies in which the Fund invests\nand, as a result, the value of the Fund.\nMiddle Eastern governments have exercised and\ncontinue to exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector. Many\neconomies in the Middle East are highly\nreliant on income from the sale of oil and\nnatural gas or trade with countries involved\nin the sale of oil and natural gas, and their\neconomies are therefore vulnerable to changes\nin the market for oil and natural gas and\nforeign currency values. As global demand for\noil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle\nEastern economies may be significantly\nimpacted. A sustained decrease in commodity\nprices could have a significant negative\nimpact on all aspects of the economy in the\nregion. Middle Eastern economies may be\nsubject to acts of terrorism, political\nstrife, religious, ethnic or socioeconomic\nunrest and sudden outbreaks of hostilities\nwith neighboring countries. Certain Middle\nEastern countries have strained relations with\nother Middle Eastern countries due to\nterritorial disputes, historical animosities,\ninternational alliances, religious tensions or\ndefense concerns, which may adversely affect\nthe economies of these countries. Certain\nMiddle Eastern countries experience\nsignificant unemployment, as well as\nwidespread underemployment. Many Middle\nEastern countries periodically have\nexperienced political, economic and social\nunrest as protestors have called for\nwidespread reform. Some of these protests have\nresulted in a governmental regime change,\ninternal conflict or civil war. If further\nregime changes were to occur, internal\nconflict were to intensify, or a civil war\nwere to continue in any of these countries,\nsuch instability could adversely affect the\neconomies of Middle Eastern countries in which\nthe Fund invests and could decrease the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investments. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by a Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed 18 foreign market on a Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Neuroscience Companies Risk.\nNeuroscience companies are often subject to\nthe potential or actual performance of a\nlimited number of products or technologies\nand, accordingly, may be greatly affected if\nany of their products or technologies proves\nto be, among other things, unsafe, ineffective\nor unprofitable, or if such product or\ntechnology is not approved by regulators or\nother governing bodies. The research and\ndevelopment and other costs associated with\ndeveloping or procuring new drugs, products or\ntechnologies and the related intellectual\nproperty rights can be significant. The\nresults of such research and expenditures are\nunpredictable and may not lead to commercially\nsuccessful products. The development and\nprotection of intellectual property rights are\ncritical for neuroscience companies, whose\nproduct pipeline and profitability may be\naffected significantly by the expiration of\npatents or the loss of, or the inability to\nenforce, intellectual property rights.\nNeuroscience companies are also subject to the\nrisk of product liability claims, which may\naffect the value of their equity securities.\nSuch companies may have thin capitalization\nand limited markets, financial resources or\npersonnel, and they are also susceptible to\nthe market and business risks of related\nindustries, such as biotechnology,\npharmaceuticals and health care equipment.\nNeuroscience companies may face political,\nlegal or regulatory challenges or constraints\nfrom competitors, industry groups or local and\nnational governments. Governmental regulation\nmay delay or inhibit the release of new\nproducts. The process for obtaining regulatory\napproval from governmental authorities, such\nas the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, can\nbe long and costly, and there can be no\nassurance that the necessary approvals will be\nobtained or maintained. Neuroscience companies\nmay also be subject to expenses and losses\nfrom expensive insurance costs due to the\nrisks of product liability claims and\nextensive litigation based on intellectual\nproperty. Health care providers, principally\nhospitals, that transact with neuroscience\ncompanies often rely on third-party payors,\nsuch as Medicare, Medicaid and other\ngovernment-sponsored programs, private health\ninsurance plans and health maintenance\norganizations, to reimburse all or a portion\nof the cost of neuroscience-related products\nor services. As a result, neuroscience\ncompanies may be sensitive to legislative\nchanges and reductions in government spending\nfor such programs, as well as state or local\nhealth care reform measures. The stock prices\nof companies in the neuroscience industry have\nbeen and will likely continue to be extremely\nvolatile, particularly when their products are\nup for regulatory approval or under regulatory\nscrutiny. Non-Diversification Risk. A Fund\nthat is classified as \u201c non-diversified \u201d may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties,\ncompared with funds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified. \u201d A non-diversified Fund thus may\nbe more susceptible to the risks associated\nwith these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. The gains and losses on such\nholdings may have a greater impact on a non-\ndiversified Fund\u2019s performance than they would\non the performance of a diversified Fund, and\na non-diversified Fund\u2019s NAV may be more\nvolatile. Non-U.S. Securities Risk. Securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers (including\ndepositary receipts) are subject to different\nlegal, regulatory, political, economic, and\nmarket risks than securities issued by U.S.\nissuers. To the extent that a Fund makes\ninvestments in a limited number of countries,\nevents in those countries will have a more\nsignificant impact on the Fund. The risks of\ninvesting in non-U.S. securities include the\nfollowing, any of which may have an adverse\nimpact on a Fund: \u25a0 Less liquid markets, which\nmay make valuing securities more difficult; \u25a0\nGreater market volatility; \u25a0 Government\nintervention in issuers' operations or\nstructure; \u25a0 Government expropriation or\nnationalization of assets; \u25a0 Exchange rate\nfluctuations and exchange controls; \u25a0\nLimitations on foreign ownership of\nsecurities; \u25a0 Imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; \u25a0 Restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital; \u25a0 Higher transaction\nand custody costs; \u25a0 Foreign market trading\nhours, different clearing and settlement\nprocedures, and holiday schedules, which may\nlimit a Fund's ability to engage in portfolio\ntransactions; \u25a0 Less regulation of the\nsecurities and other financial markets; \u25a0 Less\navailability of public information about\nissuers; \u25a0 Weaker accounting, audit,\ndisclosure and financial reporting\nrequirements and the risk of being delisted\nfrom U.S. exchanges; \u25a0 Difficulties in\nenforcing contractual obligations; and \u25a0 Legal\nprincipals relating to corporate governance,\ndirectors\u2019 fiduciary duties and liabilities,\nand shareholder rights that are less robust\nthan those that apply in the U.S. Withholding\nTax Reclaims Risk . A Fund that holds non-U.S.\nsecurities may file claims to recover\nwithholding tax on dividend and interest\nincome (if any) received from issuers in\ncertain countries where such withholding tax\nreclaim is possible. Whether or when a Fund\nwill receive a withholding tax refund is\nwithin the control of the tax authorities in\nsuch countries. Where a Fund expects to\nrecover withholding tax based on a continuous\nassessment of the probability of recovery, the\nFund\u2019s NAV generally includes accruals for\nsuch tax refunds. Funds continue 19 to\nevaluate tax developments for potential impact\nto the probability of recovery. If the\nlikelihood of receiving a tax refund\nmaterially decreases, such as due to a change\nin tax regulation or approach, accruals in a\nFund\u2019s NAV for such refunds may be written\ndown partially or in full, which will\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV. Investors in\na Fund at the time when an accrual is written\ndown will bear the impact of any resulting\nreduction in NAV regardless of whether they\nwere investors during the accrual period.\nConversely, if a Fund receives a tax refund\nthat was not previously accrued, investors in\nthe Fund at the time the claim is successful\nwill benefit from any resulting increase in\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV. Investors who sold their\nshares prior to such time will not benefit\nfrom any such NAV increase. North American\nEconomic Risk . A decrease in imports or\nexports, changes in trade regulations or an\neconomic recession in any North American\ncountry can have a significant economic effect\non the entire North American region and on\nsome or all of the North American countries in\nwhich a Fund invests. The U.S. is Canada's and\nMexico's largest trading and investment\npartner. The Canadian and Mexican economies\nare significantly affected by developments in\nthe U.S. economy. Since the implementation of\nthe North American Free Trade Agreement ( \u201c\nNAFTA \u201d ) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and\nMexico, total merchandise trade among the\nthree countries has increased. However,\npolitical developments including the\nimplementation of tariffs by the U.S. and the\nrenegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the\nUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ( \u201c\nUSMCA \u201d ), which replaced NAFTA on July 1,\n2020, could negatively affect North America\u2019s\neconomic outlook and, as a result, the value\nof securities held by a Fund. Policy and\nlegislative changes in one country may have a\nsignificant effect on North American markets\ngenerally, as well as on the value of certain\nsecurities held by a Fund. Operational Risk.\nEach Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. Each Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Real Estate\nCompanies Risk. Real estate companies, which\ninclude real estate investment trusts, real\nestate holding and operating companies, and\nreal estate management or development\ncompanies, expose investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly as well as to the\nrisks from the way that such companies\noperate. Real estate companies and property\nvalues may be adversely affected by\nregulations and other governmental actions,\nincluding tax increases, zoning changes and\nother usage restrictions, environmental\nregulations, regulatory limitations on rent or\neviction, and eminent domain. Real estate is\nhighly sensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and can be subject to intense\ncompetition and periodic overbuilding. Real\nestate companies may own a limited number of\nproperties and concentrate their investments\nin a particular geographic region, industry or\nproperty type. Economic downturns or other\nadverse events ( e.g. , natural disasters)\nthat affect a particular region, industry or\nproperty type may lead to decreases in\nproperty values, leasing declines and defaults\nby borrowers or tenants. In the event of a\ndefault, a real estate company may experience\nsubstantial delays and costs in enforcing its\nrights with respect to the property and\nprotecting its investment. In addition,\nbecause real estate is relatively illiquid, a\ncompany may be constrained in its ability to\ndiversify or liquidate its investments in\nresponse to economic conditions or other\nevents. Real estate companies may depend on\nthe management skills of a few key individuals\nand may have limited financial resources. They\nmay be highly leveraged, which can magnify\nlosses, and interest rate increases can make\nit difficult for them, as well as borrowers\nand tenants, to obtain debt financing and meet\npayment obligations. Declining interest rates\ncould result in increased prepayment on loans\nand require redeployment of capital in less\ndesirable investments. Certain real estate\ncompanies, such as REITs, could fail to\nqualify for favorable tax or regulatory\ntreatment, which could produce adverse\neconomic consequences for the company and its\ninvestors, including a Fund. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk. The economies of some\ncountries or regions depend on trading with\ncertain key trading partners. A reduction in\nspending on the products and services of these\ncountries or regions, the institution of\ntariffs or other trade barriers by a key\ntrading partner or a slowdown in the economy\nof a key trading partner may cause an adverse\nimpact on the economies of such countries or\nregions and may negatively impact the\nperformance of a Fund with exposure to those\ncountries or regions. Risk of Investing in\nChina. Investments in Chinese securities,\nincluding certain Hong Kong-listed and\nU.S.-listed securities, subject a Fund to\nrisks specific to China. The Chinese economy\nis subject to a considerable degree of\neconomic, political and social instability.\nPolitical and Social Risk. The Chinese\ngovernment is authoritarian and has\nperiodically used force to suppress civil\ndissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of\neconomic liberalization may lead to social\nturmoil, violence and labor unrest. In\naddition, China continues to experience\ndisagreements related to integration with Hong\nKong and religious and nationalist disputes in\nTibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater\nrisk in China than in many other countries of\ncurrency fluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate fluctuations and\nhigher rates of inflation as a result of\ninternal social unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries. Unanticipated political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. China's growing\nincome inequality, rapidly aging population\nand significant environmental issues also are\nfactors that may affect the Chinese economy.\nGovernment Control and Regulations. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, government control over certain\nsectors or enterprises and significant\nregulation of investment and industry is still\npervasive, including restrictions on\ninvestment in companies or industries deemed\nto be sensitive to particular national\ninterests, trading of securities of Chinese 20\nissuers, foreign ownership of Chinese\ncorporations and/or the repatriation of assets\nby foreign investors. Limitations or\nrestrictions on foreign ownership of\nsecurities may have adverse effects on the\nliquidity and performance of the Fund and\ncould lead to higher tracking error. Chinese\ngovernment intervention in the market may have\na negative impact on market sentiment, which\nmay in turn affect the performance of the\nChinese economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nChinese markets generally continue to\nexperience inefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies that may be connected to\ngovernmental influence, lack of publicly\navailable information, and political and\nsocial instability. Chinese companies, such as\nthose in the financial services or technology\nsectors, and potentially other sectors are\nalso subject to the risk that Chinese\nauthorities can intervene in their operations\nand structure, which may negatively affect the\nvalue of a Fund's investments. Economic Risk.\nThe Chinese economy may be adversely affected\nby, among other things, a deterioration in\nglobal demand for Chinese exports or a\ncontraction in spending on domestic goods by\nChinese consumers. In addition, China may\nexperience substantial rates of inflation,\nsignificant indebtedness or economic\nrecessions, which would have a negative effect\non its economy and securities market. Delays\nin enterprise restructuring, slow development\nof well-functioning financial markets and\nwidespread corruption have also hindered the\nperformance of the Chinese economy. China\ncontinues to receive substantial pressure from\ntrading partners to liberalize official\ncurrency exchange rates. Reduction in spending\non Chinese products and services, institution\nof additional tariffs or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions between China and the U.S. or in\nresponse to actual or alleged Chinese cyber\nactivity) or a downturn in any of the\neconomies of China\u2019s key trading partners may\nhave an adverse impact on the Chinese economy\nand the Chinese issuers of securities in which\nthe Fund invests. For example, the U.S. has\nadded certain foreign technology companies to\nthe U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of\nIndustry and Security\u2019s \u201c Entity List, \u201d which\nis a list of companies believed to pose a\nnational security risk to the U.S. Actions\nlike these may have unanticipated and\ndisruptive effects on the Chinese economy. Any\nsuch response that targets Chinese financial\nmarkets or securities exchanges could\ninterfere with orderly trading, delay\nsettlement or cause market disruptions.\nExpropriation Risk. The Chinese government\nmaintains a major role in economic\npolicymaking, and investing in China involves\nrisk of loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and on repatriation of\ncapital invested. Security Risk . China has\nstrained international relations with Taiwan,\nJapan, India, Russia and other neighbors due\nto territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, defense concerns and other\nsecurity concerns. China has a complex\nterritorial dispute regarding the sovereignty\nof Taiwan and has pledged to take control of\nTaiwan, including by force if necessary. The\nChinese military has conducted military drills\naround Taiwan in connection with China\u2019s claim\nto Taiwan. Taiwan-based companies and\nindividuals are significant investors in\nChina. These tensions between Taiwan and China\nmay adversely affect the Chinese economy.\nAdditionally, China is alleged to have\nparticipated in state-sponsored cyberattacks\nagainst foreign companies and foreign\ngovernments. Actual and threatened responses\nto such activity and strained international\nrelations, including purchasing restrictions,\nsanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nChinese government or Chinese companies, may\nimpact China\u2019s economy and Chinese issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund invests.\nRelations between China\u2019s Han ethnic majority\nand other ethnic groups in China, including\nTibetans and Uighurs, are also strained and\nhave been marked by protests and violence.\nThese situations may cause uncertainty in the\nChinese market and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy. In addition, conflict on the\nKorean Peninsula could adversely affect the\nChinese economy. Such risks, among others, may\nadversely affect the value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. Chinese Equity Markets. The Fund\ninvests in Chinese securities, including\nH-shares, A-shares, B-shares, Red-Chips and/or\nP-Chips. The issuance of B-shares and H-shares\nby Chinese companies and the ability to obtain\na \u201c back-door listing \u201d through Red-Chips or\nP-Chips is still regarded by the Chinese\nauthorities as an experiment in economic\nreform. \u201c Back-door listing \u201d is a means by\nwhich a mainland Chinese company issues Red-\nChips or P-Chips to obtain quick access to\ninternational listing and international\ncapital. These share mechanisms are subject to\nthe political and economic policies in China.\nHong Kong Political Risk . Hong Kong reverted\nto Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997 as a\nSpecial Administrative Region ( \u201c SAR \u201d ) of\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China ( \u201c PRC \u201d )\nunder the principle of \u201c one country, two\nsystems. \u201d Although China is obligated to\nmaintain the current capitalist economic and\nsocial system of Hong Kong through June 30,\n2047, the continuation of economic and social\nfreedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong is dependent on\nthe government of China. Since 1997, there\nhave been tensions between the Chinese\ngovernment and many people in Hong Kong who\nperceive China as tightening control over Hong\nKong\u2019s semi-autonomous liberal political,\neconomic, legal and social framework. Recent\nprotests and unrest have increased tensions\neven further. Due to the interconnected nature\nof the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this\ninstability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty\nin the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. In\naddition, the Hong Kong dollar trades at a\nfixed exchange rate in relation to (or is \u201c\npegged \u201d to) the U.S. dollar, which has\ncontributed to the growth and stability of the\nHong Kong economy. However, it is uncertain\nhow long the currency peg will continue or\nwhat effect the establishment of an\nalternative exchange rate system would have on\nthe Hong Kong economy. Because the Fund\u2019s NAV\nis denominated in U.S. dollars, the\nestablishment of an alternative exchange rate\nsystem could result in a decline in the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Limited Information and Legal Remedies .\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Funds invest\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they do not meet\nU.S. accounting standards and auditor\noversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Funds do not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. 21 Risk of\nInvesting in Cloud Computing Companies. Cloud\ncomputing companies include companies that\nprovide remote computation, software, data\naccess and storage services. The risks related\nto investing in such companies include\ndisruption in service caused by hardware or\nsoftware failure, interruptions or delays in\nservice by third-party data center hosting\nfacilities and maintenance providers, security\nbreaches involving certain private, sensitive,\nproprietary and confidential information\nmanaged and transmitted by cloud computing\ncompanies, and privacy concerns and laws,\nevolving Internet regulation and other foreign\nor domestic regulations that may limit or\notherwise affect the operations of such\ncompanies. Also, the business models employed\nby the companies in the cloud computing\nindustry may not prove to be successful. Risk\nof Investing in Cybersecurity Companies.\nCybersecurity companies are companies that\nprovide products and services intended to\nprotect the integrity of data and network\noperations for private and public networks,\ncomputers and mobile devices. Like other types\nof technology and industrials companies,\ncybersecurity companies are generally subject\nto the risks of rapidly changing technologies,\nshort product life cycles, fierce competition,\naggressive pricing and reduced profit margins,\nloss of patent, copyright and trademark\nprotections, cyclical market patterns,\nevolving industry standards and frequent new\nproduct introductions. These companies may\nalso be smaller and less experienced\ncompanies, with limited product lines,\nmarkets, qualified personnel or financial\nresources. Such companies may not be\nexclusively or substantially exposed to\ncompanies that provide products or services\nintended to protect the integrity of data and\nnetwork operations, but may be exposed to the\nmarket and business risks of other companies,\nindustries or sectors, and the Fund may be\nadversely affected by negative developments\nimpacting those other companies, industries\nand sectors. Risk of Investing in Developed\nCountries. Investment in developed country\nissuers will subject the Funds to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security,\neconomic and other risks associated with\ndeveloped countries. Developed countries\ngenerally tend to rely on services sectors (\ne.g., the financial services sector) as the\nprimary means of economic growth. A prolonged\nslowdown in one or more services sectors is\nlikely to have a negative impact on economies\nof certain developed countries, although\neconomies of individual developed countries\ncan be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors.\nIn the past, certain developed countries have\nbeen targets of terrorism, and some geographic\nareas in which the Fund invests have\nexperienced strained international relations\ndue to territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, defense concerns and other\nsecurity concerns. These situations may cause\nuncertainty in the financial markets in these\ncountries or geographic areas and may\nadversely affect the performance of the\nissuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy\nregulation of certain markets, including labor\nand product markets, may have an adverse\neffect on certain issuers. Such regulations\nmay negatively affect economic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession. Many developed\ncountries are heavily indebted and face rising\nhealthcare and retirement expenses. In\naddition, price fluctuations of certain\ncommodities and regulations impacting the\nimport of commodities may negatively affect\ndeveloped country economies. Risk of Investing\nin Emerging Markets. Investments in emerging\nmarket issuers are subject to a greater risk\nof loss than investments in issuers located or\noperating in more developed markets. This is\ndue to, among other things, the potential for\ngreater market volatility, lower trading\nvolume, higher levels of inflation, social,\npolitical or economic instability, greater\nrisk of a market shutdown and more\ngovernmental limitations on foreign\ninvestments in emerging market countries than\nare typically found in more developed markets.\nSome countries in which the Fund may invest\nmay experience economic instability, including\ninstability resulting from substantial rates\nof inflation or significant devaluations of\ntheir currency, or economic recessions, which\nwould have a negative effect on the economies\nand securities markets of their economies.\nSome of these countries may also impose\nrestrictions on the exchange or export of\ncurrency or adverse currency exchange rates\nand may be characterized by a lack of\navailable currency hedging instruments.\nDisparities of wealth, the pace and success of\ndemocratization and ethnic, religious and\nracial disaffection, among other factors, may\nexacerbate social unrest, violence and labor\nunrest in some of the countries in which the\nFund may invest. Unanticipated or sudden\npolitical or social developments may result in\nsudden and significant investment losses.\nCompanies in many emerging markets are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries, and as a result, information about\nthe securities in which the Funds invest may\nbe less reliable or complete. Moreover,\nemerging markets often have less reliable\nsecurities valuations and greater risks\nassociated with custody of securities than\ndeveloped markets. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and shareholders may have limited\nlegal remedies. The Fund does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. In addition, emerging markets\noften have greater risk of capital controls\nthrough such measures as taxes or interest\nrate control than developed markets. Certain\nemerging market countries may also lack the\ninfrastructure necessary to attract large\namounts of foreign trade and investment.\nChronic structural public sector deficits in\nsome countries in which the Fund may invest\nmay adversely impact securities held by the\nFund. Local securities markets in emerging\nmarket countries may trade a small number of\nsecurities and may be unable to respond\neffectively to changes in trading volume,\npotentially making prompt liquidation of\nholdings difficult or impossible at times.\nSettlement procedures in emerging market\ncountries are frequently less developed and\nreliable than those in the U.S. (and other\ndeveloped countries). In addition, significant\ndelays may occur in certain markets in\nregistering the transfer of securities.\nSettlement or registration problems may make\nit more difficult for the Fund to value its\nportfolio securities and could have an adverse\neffect on the Fund in seeking to achieve its\ninvestment objective. 22 Investing in emerging\nmarket countries involves a higher risk of\nloss due to expropriation, nationalization,\nconfiscation of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on foreign\ninvestments and on repatriation of capital\ninvested in certain emerging market countries.\nAs a result, investments in certain countries\nin which the Fund may invest may be subject to\nloss due to expropriation or nationalization\nof assets and property or the imposition of\nrestrictions on foreign investments and\nrepatriation of capital. Risk of Investing in\nJapan. Investing in Japanese issuers subjects\na Fund to legal, regulatory, political,\neconomic, currency, geographic and security\nrisks that are specific to Japan. Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth rate has generally remained\nlow relative to other advanced economies, and\nit may continue to remain low. Its economy\ndepends heavily on international trade and\ngovernment policy supporting its export\nmarket. Economic downturns or political\ninstability in its key trading partners, which\ninclude the United States and China, could\nhave an adverse effect on the Japanese\neconomy. Currency fluctuations also could\nadversely impact Japan\u2019s export market and its\neconomy. If the Japanese government were to\nintervene in the currency market, as it has in\nthe past, the yen\u2019s value could fluctuate\nsharply and unpredictably, which could cause\nlosses to investors. Other risks to Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth and competitiveness include\nsignificant public debt and deficits as well\nas labor shortages due to an aging and\ndeclining population. In addition, Japan lacks\nmany natural resources and relies heavily on\nimports of oil and other commodities. Price\nincreases, shortages or volatility in\ncommodities markets could have a negative\neffect on Japan\u2019s economy. Other risks to the\nJapanese economy and financial markets include\nnatural disasters and Japan\u2019s relations with\nneighboring countries, which at times have\nbeen strained. Risk of Investing in Russia.\nInvesting in Russian securities involves\nsignificant risks, in addition to those\ndescribed under \u201c Risk of Investing in\nEmerging Markets \u201d and \u201c Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk, \u201d that are not typically associated with\ninvesting in U.S. securities, including: \u25a0 The\nrisk of delays in settling portfolio\ntransactions and the risk of loss arising out\nof the system of share registration and\ncustody used in Russia; \u25a0 Risks in connection\nwith the maintenance of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities and cash with foreign sub-\ncustodians and securities depositories,\nincluding the risk that appropriate sub-\ncustody arrangements will not be available to\na Fund; \u25a0 The risk that a Fund\u2019s ownership\nrights in portfolio securities could be lost\nthrough fraud or negligence because ownership\nin shares of Russian companies is recorded by\nthe companies themselves and by registrars,\nrather than by a central registration system;\n\u25a0 The risk that a Fund may not be able to\npursue claims on behalf of its shareholders\nbecause of the system of share registration\nand custody, and because Russian banking\ninstitutions and registrars are not guaranteed\nby the Russian government; and \u25a0 The risk that\nvarious responses by other nation-states to\nalleged Russian cyber activity will impact\nRussia\u2019s economy and Russian issuers of\nsecurities in which a Fund invests. Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine . Russia launched a large-\nscale invasion of Ukraine on February 24,\n2022. The extent and duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and resulting\nfuture market disruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the value of the\nruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible\nto predict, but could be significant.\nDisruptions caused by Russian military action\nor other actions (including cyberattacks and\nespionage) or resulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity, including\npurchasing and financing restrictions,\nboycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser\npreferences, sanctions, import and export\nrestrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian companies or\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nmay impact Russia\u2019s economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which a Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Russia Sanctions. Governments,\nincluding the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., and\nmany other countries (collectively, the \u201c\nSanctioning Bodies \u201d ) have imposed economic\nsanctions on certain Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, and Russian corporate\nand banking entities, including banning Russia\nfrom global payments systems that facilitate\ncross-border payments. In an effort to curtail\nRussia\u2019s ability to finance its war effort,\nthe Sanctioning Bodies continue to elevate\nthese measures and may, going forward,\ninstitute broader sanctions on Russia. These\nsanctions, or even the threat of further\nsanctions, may result in the decline of the\nvalue and liquidity of Russian securities, a\nweakening of the ruble or other adverse\nconsequences to the Russian economy. These\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Russian securities and/or funds\ninvested in prohibited assets, impairing the\nability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or\ndeliver those securities and/or assets. The\nsanctions against certain Russian issuers\ninclude broad asset freezes and prohibitions\non transacting or otherwise dealing in select\nissuances of debt or equity of such issuers,\namong others. Compliance with each of these\nsanctions measures has impaired, and may\ncontinue to impair, the ability of a Fund to\nbuy, sell, hold, receive or deliver the\naffected securities or other securities of\nsuch issuers. A Fund may also be legally\nrequired to block (i.e., freeze) assets in a\nblocked account and report the accompanying\nexposure to Sanctioning Bodies. Sanctions have\nresulted in Russia taking counter measures or\nretaliatory actions, which has impaired the\nvalue and liquidity of Russian securities.\nThese retaliatory measures include the\nimmediate freeze of Russian assets held by a\nFund. Due to the freeze of these assets,\nincluding depositary receipts, a Fund may need\nto liquidate non-restricted assets in order to\nsatisfy any Fund redemption orders. The\nliquidation of Fund assets during this time\nmay also result in the Fund receiving\nsubstantially lower prices for its securities.\nRussia may implement additional retaliatory\nmeasures, which may further impair the value\nand liquidity of Russian securities and the\nability of a Fund to receive dividend\npayments. Russia has issued a number of\ncountersanctions, some of which restrict the\ndistribution of profits by limited liability\ncompanies (e.g., dividends), and prohibits\nRussian persons from entering into\ntransactions with designated persons from \u201c\nunfriendly 23 states \u201d as well as the export\nof raw materials or other products from Russia\nto certain sanctioned persons. Russian\ncompanies may be unable to pay dividends and,\nif they pay dividends, a Fund may be unable to\nreceive them. These sanctions, the decision by\nRussia to suspend trading on the Moscow\nExchange (MOEX) and prohibit non-resident\ninvestors from executing security sales, and\nother events have led index providers to\nremove Russian securities from indexes. Each\nFund is currently restricted from trading in\nRussian securities, including those in its\nportfolio (if any), and the Underlying Indexes\nhave removed Russian securities (if any). This\ndisparity will also lead to increased tracking\nerror. The inability of a Fund to trade in\nRussian securities may adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s ability to meet its investment\nobjective. It is unknown when, or if,\nsanctions may be lifted or a Fund\u2019s ability to\ntrade in Russian securities will resume. Risk\nof Investing in Saudi Arabia. Investing in\nSaudi Arabian issuers involves legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to Saudi\nArabia. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on\nincome from the sale of petroleum and trade\nwith other countries involved in the sale of\npetroleum, and its economy is therefore\nvulnerable to changes in foreign currency\nvalues and the petroleum market. A sustained\ndecrease in petroleum prices could have a\nnegative impact on all aspects of the economy.\nIn addition, Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy relies\nheavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes\nin the availability of this labor supply could\nhave an adverse effect on the economy.\nInvestments in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers involve risks not typically associated\nwith investments in securities of issuers in\nmore developed countries, which may negatively\naffect the value of a Fund\u2019s investments. Such\nheightened risks may include, among others,\nthe expropriation and/or nationalization of\nassets, restrictions on and government\nintervention in international trade,\nconfiscatory taxation, political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision-making,\narmed conflict, crime and instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. The government of Saudi\nArabia exercises substantial influence over\nmany aspects of the private sector, and its\nactions could significantly impact the value\nof Saudi Arabian securities. Although some\neconomic reforms ( e.g., privatization) are\nunderway, restrictions on foreign ownership\npersist, and the government has an ownership\nstake in many key industries. Saudi Arabia has\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Economic sanctions (or the threat of\nthem) on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi\nArabian corporate entities may have an adverse\nimpact on the Saudi Arabian economy and\nsecurities. The ability of foreign investors\nto invest in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership of such securities. In\naddition, the Saudi Arabian government places\ninvestment limitations on the ownership of\nSaudi Arabian issuers by foreign investors.\nSuch limits may prevent a Fund from investing\nin accordance with its strategy and result in\ntracking error for a Fund that tracks an\nindex. Saudi Arabia Broker Risk.There are a\nnumber of ways to conduct transactions in\nequity securities in the Saudi Arabian market.\nA Fund generally expects to transact in a\nmanner so that it is not limited by Saudi\nArabian regulations to a single broker.\nHowever, there may be a limited number of\nbrokers who can provide services to a Fund,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the\nprices, quantity or timing of Fund\ntransactions. A limited number of brokers may\nimpact a Fund\u2019s ability to achieve best\nexecution on transactions. In addition, a Fund\nmay be more susceptible to credit loss or\ntrading disruptions in the event of a default\nor business disruption among the available\nbrokers. If a Fund\u2019s use of a broker is\ndisrupted, there could be an adverse impact on\nthe Fund\u2019s operations and, if applicable, its\nability to track the Underlying Index, and the\nFund\u2019s shares could trade at a premium or\ndiscount to NAV. A Fund may also incur losses\ndue to the acts or omissions of its brokers in\nthe execution or settlement of transactions or\nin the transfer of funds or securities. Risk\nof Investing in South Korea. Investments in\nSouth Korean issuers involve risks that are\nspecific to South Korea, including legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security and\neconomic risks. Substantial political tensions\nexist between North Korea and South Korea.\nEscalated tensions involving the two nations\nand the outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo nations, or even the threat of an outbreak\nof hostilities, could have a severe adverse\neffect on the South Korean economy. In\naddition, South Korea's economic growth\npotential has recently been on a decline\nbecause of a rapidly aging population and\nstructural problems, among other factors. The\nSouth Korean economy is heavily reliant on\ntrading exports and disruptions or decreases\nin trade activity could lead to further\ndeclines. Risk of Investing in the U.K.\nInvesting in U.K. issuers subjects a Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, economic,\ncurrency, geographic and security risks that\nare specific to the U.K. Economic downturns or\npolitical instability in its key trading\npartners, which include the United States and\nother European countries, could have an\nadverse effect on the U.K. economy. Following\nBrexit, certain trading matters between the\nU.K. and the EU remain unresolved, including\nwith respect to financial services. Continuing\nuncertainty regarding the U.K.'s relationship\nwith the EU could have an adverse impact on\nthe economy and currency of the United\nKingdom. Other risks to the U.K.'s economic\ngrowth and competitiveness include high public\ndebt and relatively low productivity. 24 Risk\nof Investing in the U.S. Investing in U.S.\nissuers involves legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic risks that\nare specific to the U.S. A decrease in imports\nor exports, changes in trade regulations,\ninflation, an economic recession, financial\nsystem stress, or political turmoil, among\nother risks, may have an adverse effect on the\nU.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges. The U.S. is also subject to the\nrisk of natural disasters, such as droughts,\nearthquakes, fires and floods. U.S. security\nrisks include acts of terrorism, internal\nunrest and a deterioration in relations\nbetween the U.S. and certain countries. Any of\nthese may adversely affect the U.S. economy,\nfinancial markets or issuers. Governmental\nagencies project that the U.S. will maintain\nelevated public debt levels for the\nforeseeable future. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily indicate or cause\neconomic problems, the costs of servicing such\ndebt may constrain future economic growth.\nCircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal on\nU.S. government debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. U.S. Economic Risk.\nThe U.S. is a significant trading partner of,\nor foreign investor in, a number of countries.\nAs a result, the economic conditions of such\ncountries may be particularly affected by\nchanges in the U.S. economy, such as a\ndecrease in U.S. imports or exports, changes\nin trade regulations, changes in the U.S.\ndollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown\nin the U.S. Any such event may have an adverse\neffect on the economies of U.S. trading\npartners and the securities issuers in such\ncountries, which in turn could negatively\nimpact a Fund\u2019s investments. Circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent the timely\npayment of interest or principal on U.S.\ngovernment debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. Securities Lending\nRisk. A Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that a\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. A\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for a Fund. Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Investments in\nsmall-capitalization companies may be riskier,\nless liquid, more volatile and more\nsusceptible to economic, market and industry\nchanges than investments in large- or mid-\ncapitalization companies. Small-capitalization\ncompanies may have more limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, personnel and\nmanagement experience. As a result, they\ngenerally are more vulnerable than larger\ncompanies to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Small-capitalization companies\nmay have a short business track record, with\nrelatively less information available to\ninvestors. The securities of smaller companies\nmay trade less frequently and in lower volumes\nthan the securities of larger companies. Some\nsecurities of smaller issuers may be illiquid\nor restricted as to resale, and their values\nmay have significant volatility. A Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such\nsecurities at any time, or at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet the Fund\u2019s\nobligations. Small Fund Risk. When a Fund\u2019s\nsize is small, the Fund may experience low\ntrading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In\naddition, a Fund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if it does not meet certain\nrequirements set by the listing exchange. If a\nFund were required to delist from the listing\nexchange, the Fund\u2019s value may rapidly decline\nand its performance may be negatively\nimpacted. Any resulting liquidation of the\nFund could lead to elevated transaction costs\nfor the Fund and negative tax consequences for\nits shareholders. Sustainability Risk.\nSustainability risk is an inclusive term to\ndesignate investment risk (probability or\nuncertainty of occurrence of material losses\nrelative to the expected return of an\ninvestment) that relates to environmental,\nsocial or governance issues. Sustainability\nrisk around environmental issues includes, but\nis not limited to, climate risk, both physical\nand transition risk. Physical risk arises from\nthe physical effects of climate change, acute\nor chronic. For example, frequent and severe\nclimate-related events can impact products and\nservices and supply chains. Transition risk \u2013\nwhether policy, technology, market or\nreputation risk \u2013 arises from the adjustment\nto a low-carbon economy in order to mitigate\nclimate change. Risks related to social issues\ncan include, but are not limited to, labor\nrights and community relations. Governance-\nrelated risks can include but are not limited\nto risks around board independence, ownership\nand control, and audit and tax management.\nThese risks can impact an issuer\u2019s operational\neffectiveness and resilience as well as its\npublic perception and reputation, affecting\nits profitability and, in turn, its capital\ngrowth and ultimately impacting the value of\nholdings in a Fund. These are only examples of\nsustainability risk factors, and\nsustainability risk factors do not solely\ndetermine the risk profile of the investment.\nThe relevance, severity, materiality and time\nhorizon of sustainability risk factors and\nother risks can differ significantly across\nFunds. Sustainability risk can manifest itself\nthrough different existing risk types\nincluding, but not limited to, market,\nliquidity, concentration, credit and asset-\nliability mismatch risk. For example, a Fund\nmay invest in the securities of an issuer that\ncould face potentially reduced revenues or\nincreased expenditures from physical climate\nrisk ( e.g ., decreased production capacity\ndue to supply chain perturbations, lower sales\ndue to demand shocks or higher operating or\ncapital costs) or transition risk ( e.g .,\ndecreased demand for carbon-intensive products\nand services 25 or increased production costs\ndue to changing input prices). As a result,\nsustainability risk factors may have a\nmaterial impact on an investment, may increase\nvolatility, may affect liquidity and may have\nan adverse impact on the value of shares of a\nFund. The impact of those risks may be higher\nfor Funds with particular sectoral or\ngeographic concentrations. For example, Funds\nwith geographic concentration in locations\nsusceptible to adverse weather conditions\nwhere the value of the investments in the\nFunds may be more susceptible to adverse\nphysical climate events, or Funds with\nspecific sectoral concentrations, such as\ninvesting in industries or issuers with high\ncarbon intensity or high switching costs\nassociated with the transition to low carbon\nalternatives, may be more impacted by climate\ntransition risks. All or a combination of\nthese factors may have an unpredictable impact\non a Fund\u2019s investments. Under normal market\nconditions, such events could have a material\nimpact on the value of shares of a Fund.\nAssessments of sustainability risk are\nspecific to the asset class and to a fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Different asset classes\nrequire different data and tools to apply\nheightened scrutiny, assess materiality, and\nmake meaningful differentiation among issuers\nand assets. To the extent consistent with a\nFund\u2019s investment objective, risks are\nconsidered and risk managed concurrently, by\nprioritizing in part based on materiality and\non the Fund\u2019s objective. The impacts of\nsustainability risk are likely to develop over\ntime, and new sustainability risks may be\nidentified as further data and information\nregarding sustainability factors and impacts\nbecome available. Technology Companies Risk.\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources and personnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence as well as\nunexpected risks and costs related to new\nproduct introduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies may\nbe adversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs. Thematic Investing\nRisk. A Fund relies on the Index Provider to\nidentify securities that reflect the relevant\nthemes and sub-themes for inclusion in the\nUnderlying Index. There is no guarantee that\nthe Underlying Index or the Fund will reflect\nthe intended theme and sub-theme exposures.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance may suffer if such\nsecurities are not correctly identified, if a\ntheme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected\nmanner, or if securities in the Underlying\nIndex do not benefit from the development of a\ntheme or sub-theme. A Fund\u2019s performance may\nalso be impacted if securities that are not\nrelated to the theme or sub-theme are included\nin the Underlying Index.\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk. If certain\naggregate and/or fund-level ownership\nthresholds are reached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates or a Fund,\nor as a result of third-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or regulator, the ability\nof BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients\n(including a Fund) to purchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or undertake\nbusiness transactions may be restricted by\nregulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity\nof a Fund to invest in certain securities or\nother assets may be affected by the relevant\nthreshold limits, and such limitations may\nhave adverse effects on the liquidity and\nperformance of a Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings. To\nthe extent a Fund tracks an index, such limits\nmay increase the risk of the Fund being\nunderinvested in an asset relative to its\nUnderlying Index and increase the risk of\ntracking error. For example, ownership limits\nmay apply to securities whose issuers operate\nin certain regulated industries or in certain\ninternational markets. Such limits also may\napply where the investing entity (such as a\nFund) is subject to corporate or regulatory\nownership restrictions or invests in certain\nfutures or other derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel amounts invested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including a Fund) may not\nexceed the relevant limits without the grant\nof a license or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent. In other cases, exceeding such\nthresholds may cause BFA and its affiliates, a\nFund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions.\nTracking Error Risk. A Fund that tracks an\nindex is subject to the risk of \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of a Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by a Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; a Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by a Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for a Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index, such\nas during a rebalancing or reconstitution; and\nimpacts to a Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. A Fund that\ntracks an index composed of a large number of\nsecurities or other assets may experience\ngreater tracking error than a Fund that tracks\na more narrow index. Tracking error risk may\nbe heightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nUtility Companies Risk. Utility infrastructure\noften requires significant capital\nexpenditures, and utility companies may face\nhigh interest costs and difficulty in raising\ncapital. Technological innovations may render\nexisting equipment or products obsolete, and\ncompanies may experience difficulty in\nobtaining regulatory approval of new\ntechnologies. Utility operations may be\ndisrupted by events that target or 26 damage\nutility infrastructure, including natural\ndisasters and cyber or other attacks.\nUtilities companies may be adversely affected\nby volatility in the price of certain energy\nresources. Utility companies face risks from\ngovernment regulation and oversight as well as\nfrom deregulation (if applicable). Regulators\nmay monitor and control companies\u2019 revenues\nand costs. There is no assurance that\nregulators will grant rate increases or that\nrate levels will be adequate to permit the\npayment of stock dividends or bond coupon\npayments. In addition, there may be regulatory\nrestrictions on the ability of utility\ncompanies to enter new lines of business and\ngeographic areas. Utility companies incur\ncosts in complying with environmental and\nother regulations and may face significant\nchallenges in obtaining regulatory approval\nfor certain projects, such as nuclear power\nplants. Utility companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. Energy conservation, climate\nchange and other sustainability policies also\nmay impact utility companies. Deregulation may\nsubject companies to greater competition, may\nadversely affect their profitability and may\nlead them to engage in riskier ventures.\nValuation Risk. The price that a Fund could\nreceive upon the sale (or other disposition)\nof a security or other asset may differ from\nthe Fund\u2019s valuation of the security or other\nasset, particularly for securities or other\nassets that trade in low volume or volatile\nmarkets or that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by a Fund also\nmay differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index (if applicable). Because\nnon-U.S. exchanges or markets may be open on\ndays or during time periods when a Fund does\nnot price its shares, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. In addition, for\npurposes of calculating a Fund's NAV, the\nvalue of assets denominated in non-U.S.\ncurrencies (if any) is translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. For a\nFund that tracks an Underlying Index, this may\nresult in a difference between the prices used\nto calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices\nused by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,\ncould result in a difference between the\nFund's performance and the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Authorized Participants that\ncreate or redeem Fund shares on days when a\nFund is holding fair-valued securities or\nother assets may receive fewer or more shares,\nor lower or higher redemption proceeds, than\nthey would have received had the securities or\nother assets not been fair valued or been\nvalued using a different methodology. The\nability to value investments may be impacted\nby technological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. Portfolio Holdings Information A\ndescription of the policies and procedures\nwith respect to the disclosure of the Funds\u2019\nportfolio securities and other assets (as\napplicable) is available in the applicable\nStatement of Additional Information ( \u201c SAI \u201d\n). Each Fund discloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com. Fact sheets\nproviding information about each Fund\u2019s top\nholdings are posted on www.iShares.com when\navailable and may be requested by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737). Management of\nthe Funds Investment Adviser As investment\nadviser, BFA has overall responsibility for\nthe general management and administration of\nthe Funds. BFA provides an investment program\nfor the Funds and manages the investment of\nthe Funds\u2019 assets. In seeking to achieve the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment objectives, BFA\nuses teams of portfolio managers, investment\nstrategists and other investment specialists\nand may draw upon the trading, research and\nexpertise of its affiliates. This team\napproach brings together many disciplines and\nleverages BFA\u2019s extensive resources. BFA is an\nindirect wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ) and is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, BFA and its affiliates\nprovided investment advisory services for\nassets of approximately $11.5 trillion. From\ntime to time, an employee of BlackRock may\nexpress views regarding a particular security\nor other instrument, asset class, company,\nindustry, or market sector. Such views are the\nviews of only that individual as of the time\nexpressed. They do not necessarily represent\nthe views of BlackRock or any other person\nwithin the BlackRock organization. Such views\nmay change at any time based upon market or\nother conditions, and BlackRock has no\nresponsibility to update such views. You\nshould not rely on any such views as\ninvestment advice or as an indication of\ntrading intent on behalf of a Fund. Fees and\nExpenses Pursuant to the Investment Advisory\nAgreement between BFA and the Trust (entered\ninto on behalf of the Funds), BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\neach Fund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses and any\nextraordinary expenses (as determined by a\nmajority of the Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the Trust). Operating\nexpenses paid by BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude Acquired Fund Fees\nand Expenses, if any. A discussion regarding\nthe basis for the approval by the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d ) of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with BFA is\navailable in the Funds' Form N-CSR filed with\nthe SEC for the period ended July 31 and in\nthe applicable financial statements posted at\nwww.iShares.com. 27\n\nFor its investment advisory services to each\nFund, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024,\nBFA was paid a management fee from each Fund,\nas a percentage of the Fund\u2019s average daily\nnet assets, net of any applicable waivers, at\nthe annual rate set forth in the table below.\nIf BFA has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fees for a Fund, the\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nits expiration date only upon written\nagreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition,\nBFA may from time to time voluntarily waive\nand/or reimburse fees or expenses to reduce a\nFund\u2019s total annual fund operating expenses\n(excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if\nany). Any such voluntary waiver or\nreimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime.\n                                              \n  Fund                        Management Fee  \n  iShares Breakthrough                        \n  Environmental Solutions     0.47%           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Cybersecurity and   0.47%           \n  Tech ETF                                    \n  iShares Energy Storage &    0.47%           \n  Materials ETF                               \n  iShares Exponential         0.46%1          \n  Technologies ETF                            \n  iShares Future Cloud 5G     0.47%           \n  and Tech ETF                                \n  iShares Genomics                            \n  Immunology and Healthcare   0.47%           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Neuroscience and    0.47%           \n  Healthcare ETF                              \n  iShares Self-Driving EV     0.47%           \n  and Tech ETF                                \n  iShares U.S. Tech                           \n  Breakthrough Multisector    0.30%2          \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \n1 The management fee schedule for the Fund,\nincluding its breakpoint pricing arrangements,\nis described in the Fund\u2019s Statement of\nAdditional Information. 2 Effective June 28,\n2024, BFA is paid a management fee from the\nFund, as a percentage of the Fund\u2019s average\ndaily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.30%.\nPrior to June 28, 2024, BFA was paid a\nmanagement fee from the Fund, as a percentage\nof the Fund\u2019s average daily net assets, at the\nannual rate of 0.40% and voluntarily waived a\nportion of its management fee such that the\nFund\u2019s total annual fund operating expenses\nafter the fee waiver did not exceed 0.30%.\nPortfolio Managers The Portfolio Managers for\neach Fund are responsible for various\nfunctions related to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to, investing cash\ninflows, coordinating with members of their\nrespective portfolio management teams to focus\non certain asset classes, implementing\ninvestment strategy, researching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and overseeing members of\ntheir respective teams who have more limited\nresponsibilities.

BFA and its Affiliates are\ninvolved worldwide with a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset management\nactivities and in the ordinary course of\nbusiness may engage in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests of other\nclients may conflict with those of a Fund. BFA\nand its Affiliates act, or may act, as an\ninvestor, research provider, investment\nmanager, commodity pool operator, commodity\ntrading advisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent\nand/or principal. BFA and its Affiliates may\nhave other direct and indirect interests in\nsecurities, currencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other assets in which a Fund\nmay directly or indirectly invest. BFA and its\nAffiliates may engage in proprietary trading\nand advise accounts and other funds that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in and compete for\ntransactions in the same or similar types of\nsecurities, currencies and other assets as are\nheld by a Fund. This may include transactions\nin securities issued by other open-end and\nclosed-end investment companies, including\ninvestment companies that are affiliated with\nthe Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). The trading\nactivities of BFA and its Affiliates are\ncarried out without reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by a Fund. These\nactivities may result in BFA or an Affiliate\nhaving positions in assets that are senior or\njunior to, or that have interests different\nfrom or adverse to, the assets held by a Fund.\nA Fund may invest in securities issued by, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nwith which an Affiliate has significant debt\nor equity investments or other interests. A\nFund may also invest in issuances (such as\ndebt offerings or structured notes) for which\nan Affiliate is compensated for providing\nadvisory, cash management or other services. A\nFund also may invest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nfor which an Affiliate provides or may provide\nresearch coverage or other analysis. An\nAffiliate may have business relationships\nwith, and receive compensation from,\ndistributors, consultants or others who\nrecommend a Fund or who engage in transactions\nwith or for a Fund. Neither BlackRock nor any\nAffiliate is under any obligation to share any\ninvestment opportunity, idea or strategy with\na Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete\nwith a Fund for appropriate investment\nopportunities. The results of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of other\naccounts managed by an Affiliate. It is\npossible that a Fund could sustain losses\nduring periods in which one or more Affiliates\nand other accounts achieve profits on their\ntrading for proprietary or other accounts. The\nopposite result is also possible. In addition,\na Fund may enter into transactions in which\nBFA or an Affiliate or their directors,\nofficers, employees or clients have an adverse\ninterest. A Fund may be adversely impacted by\nthe effects of transactions undertaken by BFA\nor an Affiliate or their directors, officers,\nemployees or clients. From time to time,\nBlackRock or its advisory clients (including\nother funds and accounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, purchase and\nhold shares of a Fund. The price,\navailability, liquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by BlackRock\nor its advisory clients. A Fund\u2019s activities\nmay be limited because of regulatory\nrestrictions applicable to BFA or an Affiliate\nor their policies designed to comply with such\nrestrictions. Under a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board, the Funds have\nretained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as\ntheir securities lending agent to the extent\nthat they participate in the securities\nlending program. For these services, the\nsecurities lending agent will receive a fee\nfrom the participating Fund based on the\nreturns earned on the Fund\u2019s lending\nactivities, including investment of the cash\nreceived as collateral for the loaned\nsecurities. In addition, one or more\nAffiliates may be among the entities to which\na Fund may lend its portfolio securities under\nthe securities lending program. Under an ETF\nServices Agreement, certain Funds have\nretained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an Affiliate of\nBFA, to perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d )\non the design and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may have, or from\ntime to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its Affiliates. BlackRock and its\nAffiliates may benefit from a Fund using a\nBlackRock index by creating increasing\nacceptance in the marketplace for such\nindexes. BlackRock and its Affiliates are not\nobligated to license an index to a Fund, and\nno Fund is under an obligation to use a\nBlackRock index. The terms of a Fund\u2019s index\nlicensing agreement with BlackRock or its\nAffiliates may not be as favorable as the\nterms offered to other licensees. The\nactivities of BFA and its Affiliates and their\nrespective directors, officers or employees\nmay give rise to other conflicts of interest\nthat could disadvantage a Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to address these potential\nconflicts of interest. Please see the SAI for\nfurther information. 29 Shareholder\nInformation Additional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy and sell\nshares of the Funds, is available free of\ncharge by calling toll-free 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting www.iShares.com.\nBuying and Selling Shares Transactions in\nshares of the Funds occur in the primary\nmarket and the secondary market. Primary\nmarket transactions, known as \u201c creations \u201d\nand \u201c redemptions, \u201d occur only between the\nFunds and Authorized Participants ( i.e .,\nfinancial institutions that are authorized to\nparticipate in such transactions), as\ndescribed in the Creations and Redemptions\nsection below. Fund shares are listed on U.S.\nnational securities exchanges, where they can\nbe bought and sold throughout the trading day\nat market prices, like shares of other\npublicly traded companies. A Fund\u2019s shares may\nalso be available in other secondary markets,\nsuch as on non-U.S. exchanges and through\nfunds or structured investment vehicles\nsimilar to depositary receipts. The Funds do\nnot impose any minimum investment for Fund\nshares purchased on an exchange or otherwise\nin the secondary market. Buying or selling\nFund shares on an exchange or other secondary\nmarket generally involves two types of costs\nthat are common in securities transactions.\nFirst, when buying or selling Fund shares\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. The commission\nis frequently a fixed amount; it may be a\nsignificant proportional cost if you are\nseeking to buy or sell small amounts of\nshares. Second, you may incur the cost of the\n\u201c spread, \u201d which is any difference between\nthe bid price and the ask price for the\nshares. The spread varies over time based on a\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market liquidity.\nGenerally, the spread is smaller if a Fund has\nhigh trading volume and market liquidity, and\nlarger if a Fund has lower trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. The latter is often the case\nfor newly launched or smaller funds. A Fund\u2019s\nspread may also be impacted by the liquidity\n(or lack thereof) of the underlying securities\nor other assets held by the Fund, particularly\nfor newly launched or smaller funds, or by\ninstances of significant volatility of the\nunderlying assets. The U.S. national\nsecurities exchanges that list Fund shares are\nopen for trading Monday through Friday and are\nclosed on weekends and the following holidays\n(or the days on which they are observed): New\nYear\u2019s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents\u2019 Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,\nJuneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.\nInvestments in Investment Companies Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts\ninvestments by investment companies, including\nforeign and unregistered investment companies,\nin the securities of other investment\ncompanies. For example, a registered\ninvestment company (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Funds, may not knowingly sell or\notherwise dispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any investment company\n(the \u201c Acquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company or\ncompanies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if,\nimmediately after such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or\n(ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and other investment\ncompanies and companies controlled by them.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, registered\ninvestment companies are permitted to invest\nin a Fund beyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions set forth in Rule 12d1-4 under the\n1940 Act. To make such an investment in an\nAcquired Fund, a registered investment company\nmust, among other things, enter into an\nagreement with the Trust. If an Acquired Fund\ninvests significantly in other registered\ninvestment companies in reliance on Rule\n12d1-4, an Acquiring Fund will not be\npermitted to rely on Rule 12d1-4 and invest in\nthe Fund beyond the Section 12(d)(1) limits.\nAny investment company interested in\npurchasing shares of a Fund beyond the limits\nset forth in Section 12(d)(1) should contact\nBFA. Foreign investment companies are\npermitted to invest in a Fund only up to the\nlimits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject\nto any applicable SEC no-action relief. Book\nEntry Shares of the Funds are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The Depository Trust\nCompany ( \u201c DTC \u201d ), which serves as the\nsecurities depository for shares of the Funds,\nor its nominee is the record owner of, and\nholds legal title to, all outstanding shares\nof the Funds. Investors owning Fund shares are\nbeneficial owners as shown on the records of\nDTC or its participants. DTC participants\ninclude securities brokers and dealers, banks,\ntrust companies, clearing corporations and\nother institutions that directly or indirectly\nmaintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As\na beneficial owner of Fund shares, you are not\nentitled to receive physical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares registered in\nyour name, and you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares. Therefore, to\nexercise any right as an owner of Fund shares,\nyou must rely upon the procedures of DTC and\nits participants. These procedures are the\nsame as those that apply to any other\nsecurities held in book-entry or \u201c street name\n\u201d form. Share Prices The trading prices of a\nFund\u2019s shares in the secondary market\ngenerally differ from the Fund\u2019s daily NAV and\nare affected by various factors, such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF shares and the\nsecurities or other assets held by a Fund as\nwell as other market and economic conditions.\n30 Determination of Net Asset Value The NAV of\na Fund normally is determined once daily\nMonday through Friday, on each day that the\nNew York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) is open\nfor trading. The NAV generally is determined\nas of the close of the NYSE\u2019s regular trading\nhours, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, based\non prices at the time of closing. Any Fund\nassets or liabilities that are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing\nmarket rates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data service providers.\nThe NAV of a Fund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s net assets ( i.e .,\nthe value of its total assets, including the\nvalue of any underlying fund shares in which\nthe Fund invests, less total liabilities) by\nthe total number of outstanding shares of the\nFund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.\nThe value of a Fund\u2019s assets and liabilities\nis determined pursuant to BFA\u2019s valuation\npolicies and procedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the valuation\ndesignee for each Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5\nunder the Investment Company Act. Equity\nsecurities and other equity instruments for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at market value, which is generally\ndetermined using the last reported official\nclosing price or, if a reported closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on the\nexchange or market on which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at the time of\nvaluation. Shares of underlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds) that are not\ntraded on an exchange are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying ETFs and closed-\nend funds that trade on exchanges are valued\nat their most recent market closing price.\nFixed-income securities are valued using last\navailable bid prices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or prices\n(including evaluated prices) supplied by the\nFunds\u2019 approved independent third-party\npricing services, each in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s valuation policies and procedures.\nPricing services may use matrix pricing or\nvaluation models that utilize certain inputs\nand assumptions to derive values. Pricing\nservices generally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly transactions of an\ninstitutional round lot size, but a Fund may\nhold or transact in such securities in smaller\nodd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower\nprices than institutional round lots. An\namortized cost method of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations with 60 days\nor less remaining to maturity unless BFA\ndetermines in good faith that such method does\nnot represent fair value. Generally, trading\nin certain instruments ( e.g ., non-U.S.\nsecurities, money market instruments, etc.) is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of the NYSE\u2019s regular\ntrading hours. The values of such instruments\nused in computing a Fund\u2019s NAV are determined\nas of such times. For certain foreign assets,\na third-party vendor supplies evaluated,\nsystematic fair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-factor model\nafter the relevant foreign markets have\nclosed. This systematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to correlate the\nprices of foreign assets in one or more\nnon-U.S. markets following the close of the\nlocal markets to the prices that might have\nprevailed as of a Fund\u2019s pricing time.\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options may\nbe valued using a mathematical model that may\nincorporate a number of market data factors.\nWhen market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in accordance with its policies\nand procedures. Fair value represents a good\nfaith approximation of the value of an asset\nor liability. It is the amount that the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive from the\ncurrent sale of an asset or the cost to\nextinguish a liability in an arm\u2019s-length\ntransaction. BFA may conclude that a market\nquotation is not readily available or is\nunreliable if: \u25a0 An asset or liability does\nnot have a price source due to its lack of\ntrading or other reasons; \u25a0 A market quotation\ndiffers significantly from recent price\nquotations or otherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value; \u25a0 An asset or liability is\nthinly traded; \u25a0 There is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent market\nquotation; or \u25a0 The trading market on which an\ninstrument is listed is suspended or closed\nand no appropriate alternative trading market\nis available. A \u201c significant event \u201d is\ndeemed to occur if BFA determines, in its\nreasonable business judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u2019s assets or\nliabilities, that the event is likely to cause\na material change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nof the Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities. Valuing a\nFund\u2019s investments using fair value pricing\nmay result in prices that differ from current\nmarket valuations and that may not be the\nprices at which those investments could have\nbeen sold during the period for which the\nparticular fair values were used. For an index\nFund, the use of both fair value prices and\ncurrent market valuations in a particular NAV\ncalculation could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying index. This could, in turn, result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of its underlying index.\n31 Dividends and Distributions General\nPolicies. A Fund generally declares and pays\ndividends from net investment income, if any,\nat least once a year. Distributions of net\nrealized securities gains, if any, generally\nare declared and paid once a year, but the\nTrust may make distributions on a more\nfrequent basis for a Fund. The Trust reserves\nthe right to declare special distributions if,\nin its reasonable discretion, such action is\nnecessary or advisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d )\nor to avoid the imposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or realized\ngains. Dividends and other distributions on\nFund shares are distributed on a pro rata\nbasis to beneficial owners of the shares.\nDividend payments and other distributions are\nmade through DTC participants and indirect\nparticipants to beneficial owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from the Funds.\nDividend Reinvestment Service. No dividend\nreinvestment service is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make the DTC book-entry\nDividend Reinvestment Program available to\nbeneficial owners of Fund shares for the\nreinvestment of distributions. Beneficial\nowners should contact their broker to\ndetermine the availability and costs of the\nservice and the details of participation.\nBrokers may require beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and timetables.\nIf the program is used, dividend distributions\nof both income and realized gains will be\nautomatically reinvested in additional whole\nFund shares purchased in the secondary market.\nNote on Tax Information. The following\nsections summarize some of the consequences\nunder current U.S. federal tax law of an\ninvestment in a Fund. This information is not\na substitute for personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and local taxation on\nFund distributions and sales of Fund shares.\nDistributions that are attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal government\nobligations may be exempt from certain state\nand local tax. Consult your personal tax\nadvisor about the potential tax consequences\nof an investment in Fund shares under all\napplicable tax laws. Taxes As with any\ninvestment, you should consider how your\ninvestment in shares of a Fund will be taxed,\nincluding possible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or when you sell Fund\nshares. The tax information in this Prospectus\nis provided as general information, based on\ncurrent law. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund. There is no\nguarantee that shares of a Fund will receive\ncertain regulatory or accounting treatment.\nTaxes on Fund Distributions Shareholders in a\nFund will receive information after the end of\neach calendar year setting forth the amount of\ndividends and long-term capital gains\ndistributed to them by the Fund during the\nprior year, if any. Likewise, the amount of\ntax-exempt income, if any, that a Fund\ndistributes will be reported. Such income must\nbe reported on the shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax return. In general, distributions\nare subject to U.S. federal income tax for the\nyear when they are paid. Certain distributions\npaid in January, however, may be treated as\npaid on December 31 of the prior year. Capital\nGains. Distributions from a Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than qualified\ndividend income or from net tax-exempt income,\nif any), including distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and distributions out\nof a Fund\u2019s net short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as ordinary income.\nDistributions by a Fund of net long-term\ncapital gains, if any, in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses (capital gain dividends)\nare taxable to you as long-term capital gains,\nregardless of how long you have held the\nFund\u2019s shares. Long-term capital gains and\nqualified dividend income are generally\neligible for taxation at preferential rates\nfor non-corporate shareholders. However,\ndifferent preferential rates may apply\ndepending on the type of capital gains, such\nas Fund distributions of certain amounts\nreceived from real estate investment trusts (\n\u201c REITs \u201d ), if any. Return of Capital. If a\nFund\u2019s distributions exceed current and\naccumulated earnings and profits, all or a\nportion of the distributions made in the\ntaxable year may be recharacterized as a\nreturn of capital to shareholders. A return of\ncapital distribution generally will not be\ntaxable but will reduce the shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis and result in a higher capital gain or\nlower capital loss when those shares on which\nthe distribution was received are sold. Once a\nshareholder\u2019s cost basis is reduced to zero,\nfurther distributions will be treated as\ncapital gains, if the shareholder holds shares\nof the Fund as capital assets. Distributions\nin excess of a Fund\u2019s minimum distribution\nrequirements, but not in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be taxable to\nshareholders and will not constitute\nnontaxable returns of capital. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by a Fund that\nqualify as qualified dividend income, if any,\nare taxable to you at long-term capital gain\nrates. Dividends will be qualified dividend\nincome to you if they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income received by a Fund.\nGenerally, qualified dividend income includes\ndividend income from stock issued by taxable\nU.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S.\ncorporations, provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements and has\nnot hedged its position in the stock in\ncertain ways. For this purpose, a qualified\nnon-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S.\ncorporation that is eligible for benefits\nunder a comprehensive income tax treaty with\nthe U.S., which includes an exchange of\ninformation program, or if the stock with\nrespect to which the dividend was paid is\nreadily tradable on an established U.S.\nsecurities market. The term excludes a\ncorporation that is a passive foreign\ninvestment company. Dividends received by a\nFund from a RIC, if any, generally are\nqualified dividend income only to the extent\nthat such dividend distributions are made out\nof qualified dividend income received by such\nRIC. Additionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from a REIT, if\nany, 32 and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a Fund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified business income\n\u201d deduction for non-corporate U.S.\nshareholders to the extent that the Fund\u2019s\nincome is derived from ordinary REIT\ndividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.\nFor a dividend to be treated as qualified\ndividend income, the dividend must be received\nwith respect to a share of stock held without\nbeing hedged by the relevant Fund, and with\nrespect to a share of the Fund held without\nbeing hedged by you, for 61 days during the\n121-day period beginning at the date that is\n60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such date. Fund\ndistributions, to the extent attributable to\ndividends from U.S. corporations, will be\neligible for the dividends received deduction\nfor Fund shareholders that are corporations,\nsubject to certain hedging and holding\nrequirements. Substitute dividends received by\na Fund with respect to dividends paid on\nsecurities lent out, if any, will not be\nqualified dividend income. Medicare Tax. A\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is\nimposed on \u201c net investment income, \u201d\nincluding, but not limited to, interest,\ndividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if\nmarried and filing jointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Alternative Minimum Tax. The AMT is a\nseparate U.S. federal tax system that operates\nin parallel to the regular federal income tax\nsystem but eliminates many deductions and\nexclusions. The AMT has different tax rates\nand treats as taxable certain types of income\nthat are nontaxable for regular income tax\npurposes, such as the interest on certain \u201c\nprivate activity \u201d municipal bonds. If a\ntaxpayer\u2019s overall AMT liability is higher\nthan regular income tax liability, then the\ntaxpayer owes the regular income tax liability\nplus the difference between the AMT liability\nand the regular income tax liability. Market\nDiscount Bonds Any market discount recognized\non a bond, including a tax-exempt interest\nbond, is taxable as ordinary income. A market\ndiscount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or adjusted issue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount. To the extent that a\nFund does not include the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gains on the Fund\u2019s\ndisposition of such an obligation will be\ntreated as ordinary income rather than capital\ngains to the extent of the accrued market\ndiscount. Derivatives and Other Complex\nInstruments A Fund may invest in derivatives\nand other complex instruments, and such\ninvestments may be subject to special and\ncomplicated rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund\nare treated as ordinary income or capital\ngains, accelerate the recognition of income to\na Fund or defer a Fund\u2019s ability to recognize\nlosses. In addition, these rules may affect\nthe amount, timing or character of income\ndistributed to you by a Fund. You should\nconsult your personal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules. Non-U.S.\nIncome Taxes Dividends, interest and capital\ngains (if any) earned by a Fund with respect\nto securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may\ngive rise to withholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If,\nat the close of a year, more than 50% of a\nFund\u2019s total assets consist of non-U.S. stocks\nor securities (generally, for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ), generally the Fund may \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to you certain non-U.S. income\ntaxes, including withholding taxes, paid by\nthe Fund. This means that you would be\nconsidered to have received as an additional\ndividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes,\nbut you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your U.S.\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not pass through\nnon-U.S. taxes, the Fund will be entitled to\nclaim a deduction for certain foreign taxes\nthat it incurs. Under certain circumstances,\nif a Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes\npaid with respect to a prior year, the value\nof Fund shares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions passed\nthrough to shareholders with respect to the\nFund\u2019s foreign taxes for the current year\ncould be reduced. If, at the close of the\nyear, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets\nconsist of stocks or securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers, including depositary\nreceipts (no matter where traded) of non-U.S.\ncompanies, or, at the close of each quarter,\nmore than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets consist\nof shares of an Underlying Fund, the Fund may\n\u201c pass-through \u201d to you certain non-U.S.\nincome taxes (including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund or, if its assets meet these\nrequirements, the Underlying Fund. For\npurposes of foreign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of a Fund, foreign capital gains\ntaxes may not produce associated foreign\nsource income, limiting the availability of\nsuch credits for U.S. persons. Non-U.S.\nShareholders If you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S.\nentity (other than a pass-through entity to\nthe extent owned by U.S. persons), a Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term capital\ngains), if any, generally will be 33 subject\nto a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless\na lower treaty rate applies. However,\nwithholding tax generally will not apply to\nany gain or income realized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder with respect to any distribution\nof long-term capital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of Fund shares. Separately,\na 30% withholding tax may be imposed on Fund\ndistributions (if any) paid to certain foreign\nentities, unless such entities comply, or are\ndeemed compliant, with extensive reporting and\nwithholding requirements designed to inform\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury of\nU.S.-owned foreign investment accounts. Backup\nWithholding If you are a resident or a citizen\nof the U.S. and you have not provided a\ntaxpayer identification number or social\nsecurity number and made other required\ncertifications, by law, backup withholding at\na 24% rate will apply to Fund distributions\nand proceeds (if any). Securities Lending If\nyour shares of a Fund are loaned out pursuant\nto a securities lending arrangement, you may\nlose the ability to treat Fund dividends that\nare paid while the shares are held by the\nborrower as qualified dividend income, and you\nmay lose the ability to use non-U.S. tax\ncredits passed through by the Fund. Fund of\nFunds If a Fund invests in an Underlying Fund,\nshort-term capital gains earned by the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will be ordinary\nincome when distributed to the Fund and will\nnot be offset by the Fund\u2019s capital losses. To\nthe extent such Fund is expected to invest in\nan Underlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s realized losses\non sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may\nbe indefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c\nwash sales. \u201d Capital loss carryforwards of\nthe Underlying Fund, if any, will not offset\nnet capital gains of the Fund. Taxes on the\nSale of Exchange-Listed Fund Shares Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund shares is generally treated as a long-\nterm capital gain or loss if the shares have\nbeen held for more than one year. Any capital\ngain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund\nshares that have been held for one year or\nless is generally treated as a short-term\ncapital gain or loss. However, any capital\nloss on a sale of Fund shares held for six\nmonths or less is treated as a long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to such\nshares. Any such capital gains, including from\nsales of Fund shares or from capital gain\ndividends, are included in \u201c net investment\nincome \u201d for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal\nMedicare contribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions Prior to being\ntraded in the secondary market, Fund shares\nare \u201c created \u201d at NAV by Authorized\nParticipants ( i.e. , market makers, large\ninvestors and other financial institutions) in\nblock-size Creation Units or multiples\nthereof. Fund shares are created or redeemed\nonly in Creation Units, and only Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem Creation\nUnits with the Funds. Each Authorized\nParticipant is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC and\nhas entered into a written agreement with the\nFunds\u2019 Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. The\nagreement allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. Authorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units for their own\naccounts or for customers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of the Funds. Creation\ntransactions are subject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the relevant Fund. Generally,\nthere are three transaction methods for\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares: in-kind\nsecurities ( \u201c in-kind \u201d ), partial cash and\nall cash. In-Kind . In a creation transaction,\nan Authorized Participant deposits into a Fund\na \u201c creation basket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets designated by the\nFund, as well as a cash amount. The Authorized\nParticipant receives a specified number of\nCreation Units in return. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits Creation Units with a Fund and\nreceives from the Fund a \u201c redemption basket,\n\u201d which is a portfolio of securities or other\nassets designated by the Fund, as well as a\ncash amount. Partial Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund a creation basket and a\ncash amount, including cash that replaces a\nsecurity or other asset in the creation\nbasket, in exchange for Creation Units. In a\nredemption transaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation Units with a\nFund and receives from the Fund a redemption\nbasket and a cash amount, including cash that\nreplaces a security or other asset in the\nredemption basket. All Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund an amount of cash\nspecified by the Fund in exchange for Creation\nUnits. In a redemption transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits Creation Units\nwith a Fund and receives from the Fund a\nspecified amount of cash. The creation and\nredemption baskets for a Fund may differ in\ncomposition, and certain iShares ETFs accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d More information about\ncustom baskets is provided in the Funds\u2019 SAI.\nEach Fund generally engages in creation and\nredemption transactions according to the\nmethod indicated in the table below. In\ncertain circumstances, however, a Fund may use\nanother transaction method ( e.g. , an in-kind\nFund may transact partially or fully in cash).\n34\n                                              \n  Fund        In-Kind  Partial      All Cash  \n                       Cash                   \n  iShares                                     \n  Breakthro\u2026                                  \n  Environme\u2026           \u2713                      \n  Solutions                                   \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Cybersecu\u2026           \u2713                      \n  and Tech                                    \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Energy                                      \n  Storage &            \u2713                      \n  Materials                                   \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Exponenti\u2026           \u2713                      \n  Technolog\u2026                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Future                                      \n  Cloud 5G             \u2713                      \n  and Tech                                    \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Genomics                                    \n  Immunology           \u2713                      \n  and                                         \n  Healthcare                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Neuroscie\u2026                                  \n  and                  \u2713                      \n  Healthcare                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Self-Driv\u2026           \u2713                      \n  EV and                                      \n  Tech ETF                                    \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S. Tech                                   \n  Breakthro\u2026  \u2713                               \n  Multisect\u2026                                  \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nThe prices at which creations and redemptions\noccur are based on the next calculation of a\nFund\u2019s NAV after a creation or redemption\norder is tendered in an acceptable form under\nthe Authorized Participant agreement. In the\nevent of a system failure or other\ninterruption, including disruptions at market\nmakers or Authorized Participants, creation\nand redemption orders may not be executed\naccording to a Fund\u2019s instructions or may not\nbe executed at all. Additional information\nabout the creation and redemption of Creation\nUnits (including the cut-off times for the\nreceipt of creation and redemption orders) is\nincluded in the Funds\u2019 SAI. The Funds do not\nimpose restrictions on the frequency of\npurchases and redemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with a Fund. The Board determined not\nto adopt policies and procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares because each Fund\ngenerally sells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions that are in-kind\nand/or for cash, with a deadline for placing\ncash-related transactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities. However, the Funds have\ntaken certain measures ( e.g. , imposing\ntransaction fees on purchases and redemptions\nof Creation Units and reserving the right to\nreject purchases of Creation Units under\ncertain circumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of frequent cash\npurchases and redemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased tracking\nerror, disruption of portfolio management,\ndilution to the Funds, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the vast majority\nof trading in Fund shares occurs on the\nsecondary market, which does not involve the\nFunds directly, and such trading is unlikely\nto cause many of the harmful effects of\nfrequent cash purchases or redemptions of Fund\nshares. To the extent a Fund engages in in-\nkind transactions, the Fund intends to comply\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws in\naccepting securities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with redemption\nsecurities by, among other means, assuring\nthat any securities accepted for deposit and\nany securities used to satisfy redemption\nrequests will be sold in transactions that\nwould be exempt from registration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201c 1933\nAct \u201d ). Further, an Authorized Participant\nthat is not a \u201c qualified institutional buyer,\n\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 144A under\nthe 1933 Act, will not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. Because Fund shares may be\ncreated and issued on an ongoing basis, at any\npoint during the life of a Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is used in the\n1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nthat could render them statutory underwriters\nsubject to the prospectus delivery and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nmust take into account all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each particular case.\nBroker-dealers should also note that dealers\nwho are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution (as contrasted\nto ordinary secondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part of an \u201c\nunsold allotment \u201d within the meaning of\nSection 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be\nunable to take advantage of the prospectus\ndelivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3)\nof the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses\nto exchange members, the prospectus delivery\nmechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\na national securities exchange. Householding\nHouseholding is an option available to certain\nFund investors. Householding is a method of\ndelivery, based on the preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a single copy of\ncertain shareholder documents can be delivered\nto investors who share the same address, even\nif their accounts are registered under\ndifferent names. Please contact your broker-\ndealer if you are interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a single copy of\nprospectuses and other shareholder documents,\nor if you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change your\nhouseholding status. Distribution The\nDistributor or its agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the Funds on an agency basis. The\nDistributor does not maintain a secondary\nmarket in shares of the Funds. The Distributor\nhas no role in determining the policies of the\nFunds or the securities or other assets (as\napplicable) that are purchased or sold by the\nFunds. The Distributor\u2019s principal address is\n50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001.\n\n35\n\nBFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-\ndealers, registered investment advisers, banks\nor other intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, data provision services, or\ntheir making shares of the Funds available to\ntheir customers generally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such payments, which may\nbe significant to the intermediary, are not\nmade by the Funds. Rather, such payments are\nmade by BFA or its affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or indirectly\nin part from fees paid by the Funds. Payments\nof this type are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions about which\ninvestment options it recommends or makes\navailable, or the level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the payments or\nother financial incentives the intermediary is\neligible to receive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives that are offered\nor made to an intermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary and its\ncustomers and may cause the intermediary to\nrecommend the Funds over another investment.\nMore information regarding these payments is\ncontained in the applicable SAI. Please\ncontact your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional for more information regarding\nany such payments that their firm may receive\nfrom BFA or its affiliates. Financial\nHighlights The financial highlights table for\neach Fund is intended to help you understand\nthe Fund\u2019s financial performance for the past\nfive fiscal years or, if shorter, the period\nsince the Fund\u2019s inception.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $18         $58     $101      $230  \n                                      \nS-1\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund\u2019s portfolio turnover\nrate was 24% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Extended ESG\nReduced Carbon Target Index (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ), which has been developed by MSCI\nInc. (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ).\nThe Underlying Index is designed to measure\nthe performance of large- and mid-\ncapitalization U.S. equity securities that, in\nthe aggregate, reflect the performance of a\nminimum volatility strategy and, relative to\nthe MSCI USA Index ( \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), have\nhigher favorable environmental, social, and\ngovernance ( \u201c ESG \u201d ) characteristics (as\ndefined by the Index Provider) and lower\ncarbon exposure. The Index Provider begins\nwith the Parent Index and excludes securities\nof companies involved in the business of\ntobacco, companies involved with controversial\nweapons, producers and retailers of civilian\nfirearms, and companies involved in certain\nclimate change-related activity such as the\nproduction of thermal coal and extraction of\noil sands, based on revenue or percentage of\nrevenue thresholds for certain categories (\ne.g ., $20 million or 5%) and categorical\nexclusions for others ( e.g ., controversial\nweapons). The Index Provider also excludes\ncompanies involved in very severe business\ncontroversies, defined as an instance or\nongoing situation in which company operations\nand/or products allegedly have a negative ESG\nimpact, including alleged violations of laws,\nregulations, or accepted international norms (\ne.g ., human rights violations or toxic\nemissions and waste). In each case, severe\nbusiness controversies are determined by the\nIndex Provider based on an MSCI ESG\nControversy Score. The Index Provider also\nexcludes companies that are not assessed by\nthe Index Provider regarding severe business\ncontroversies or their management of ESG risks\nand opportunities ( \u201c ESG Score, \u201d in each\ncase determined by the Index Provider). For\nESG scoring, the Index Provider identifies,\nfor each industry, key ESG issues that may\ngenerate unanticipated costs for a given\ncompany or industry (as determined by the\nIndex Provider). The Index Provider has\nidentified 35 key ESG issues across the\nfollowing 10 themes: climate change, natural\ncapital, pollution and waste, environmental\nopportunities, human capital, product\nliability, stakeholder opposition, social\nopportunities, corporate governance and\ncorporate behavior. The Index Provider then\ncalculates the size of each company\u2019s exposure\nto each key issue based on the company\u2019s\nbusiness segment and geographic risk and\nanalyzes the extent to which the company has\ndeveloped robust strategies and programs to\nmanage ESG risks and opportunities. Using a\nsector-specific weighting model, companies are\nrated and ranked in comparison to their\nindustry peers. A higher rating indicates that\na company exhibits more favorable ESG\ncharacteristics and greater resilience to\nlong-term, material ESG risks specific to that\nindustry. The Index Provider then follows a\nquantitative process that is designed to\ndetermine the carbon exposure of a security in\nterms of the issuer\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions\nand its potential carbon emissions from fossil\nfuel reserves. The Index Provider further\nrefines the Underlying Index through an\noptimization process that aims to achieve (1)\nthe lowest volatility in light of certain\nreplicability and investability constraints as\ndefined by the Index Provider; (2) at least a\n20% improvement in its weighted-average,\nindustry-adjusted ESG Score relative to the\nParent Index at each rebalancing; and (3) a\nreduction in carbon exposure as represented by\nat least a 30% reduction, relative to the\nParent Index at each rebalancing, in (a)\ncarbon emissions relative to the overall size\nof a company and (b) potential carbon\nemissions from fossil fuel reserves used for\npotential energy production per dollar of\nmarket capitalization. The weight of any\nsingle security is capped at the lower of 1.5%\nand 20 times the weight of the security in the\nParent Index. The Underlying Index is\nrebalanced semi-annually. As of July 31, 2024,\na significant portion of the Underlying Index\nis represented by securities of companies in\nthe healthcare and technology industries or\nsectors. The components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over time. BFA uses\nan indexing approach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund does not try to\n\u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 90% of its\nassets in the component securities of the\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 10% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. S-2 The\nFund may lend securities representing up to\none-third of the value of the Fund's total\nassets (including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by MSCI, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex.

The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. ESG Risk. To the\nextent that the Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. The Underlying Index\u2019s use\nof ESG criteria may result in the Fund\ninvesting in, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Low Volatility Risk . A low\nvolatility strategy may underperform the\nbroader market during periods of strong,\nrising or speculative stock prices. In\naddition, there is a risk that the Fund may\nexperience more than minimum volatility.\nSecurities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may be\nsubject to price volatility, and their prices\nmay not be less volatile (and could be more\nvolatile) than the market as a whole, which\ncould adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Assets Under Management\n(AUM) Risk . From time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below in Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk ), a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, or another\nfund may invest in the Fund and hold its\ninvestment for a specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such entity would\nnot redeem its investment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at such levels,\nwhich could negatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk. An\n\u201c Authorized Participant \u201d is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof S-3 creation units ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ).\nOnly an Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Healthcare\nCompanies Risk . The profitability of\nhealthcare companies may be adversely affected\nby extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, the\nprotection and expiration of patents, limited\nproduct lines, supply chain issues, labor\nshortages and product liability claims, among\nother factors. Issuer Risk . The performance\nof the Fund depends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other assets to which\nthe Fund has exposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small Fund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted\nif it does not meet certain requirements set\nby the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could lead to elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its shareholders.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or S-4 impairment of those rights.\nTechnology companies may face increased\ngovernment scrutiny and may be subject to\nadverse government or legal action. Tracking\nError Risk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c\ntracking error, \u201d which is the divergence of\nthe Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Until the Fund reaches\ngreater scale, it may experience higher\ntracking error than is typical for similar\nindex ETFs.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-6\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2021. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to\nas an \u201c ETF \u201d ). Individual shares of the Fund\nmay only be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer. Because ETF\nshares trade at market prices rather than at\nNAV, shares may trade at a price greater than\nNAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount).\nAn investor may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of\nthe Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller\nis willing to accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ).\nTax Information The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an\nindividual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in\nwhich case, your distributions generally will\nbe taxed when withdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase shares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems or other services related to\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $15         $48      $85      $192  \n                                      \nS-8\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 25% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USD) Index\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which has been\ndeveloped by MSCI Inc. (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d\nor \u201c MSCI \u201d ) to measure the performance of\nlarge- and mid-capitalization equity\nsecurities listed on stock exchanges in the\nU.S. that, in the aggregate, have lower\nvolatility relative to the large- and mid-cap\nU.S. equity market. In constructing the\nUnderlying Index, MSCI uses a rules-based\nmethodology to select securities from the MSCI\nUSA Index (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), which is a\ncapitalization-weighted index, and to\ndetermine the weightings of such securities.\nIn order to determine weightings of securities\nwithin the Underlying Index, MSCI seeks to\noptimize the Parent Index such that the\nresulting portfolio exhibits the lowest\nabsolute volatility, as measured by MSCI,\nwhile applying constraints based on turnover,\nminimum and maximum weightings of index\nconstituents, sectors and countries, as well\nas factor constraints (for example, liquidity\nand financial leverage) as measured by MSCI.\nThe Underlying Index includes large- and mid-\ncapitalization companies and may change over\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the financials,\nhealthcare and technology industries or\nsectors. The components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over time. BFA uses\nan indexing approach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund does not try to\n\u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by MSCI, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Low Volatility Risk .\nA low volatility strategy may underperform the\nbroader market during periods of strong,\nrising or speculative stock prices. In\naddition, there is a risk that the Fund may\nexperience more than minimum volatility.\nSecurities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may be\nsubject to price volatility, and their prices\nmay not be less volatile (and could be more\nvolatile) than the market as a whole, which\ncould adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of S-9 reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nHealthcare Companies Risk . The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, the\nprotection and expiration of patents, limited\nproduct lines, supply chain issues, labor\nshortages and product liability claims, among\nother factors. Issuer Risk . The performance\nof the Fund depends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other assets to which\nthe Fund has exposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund S-10 shares\n(including through a trading halt), losses\nfrom trading in secondary markets, periods of\nhigh volatility, and disruptions in the\nprocess of creating and redeeming Fund shares.\nAny of these factors, among others, may lead\nto the Fund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary\nmarket at a premium or discount to NAV or to\nthe intraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Technology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-11\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-12\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2011 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund.

The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.15%     None       0.00%       0.15%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $15         $48      $85      $192  \n                                      \nS-14\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 95% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI USA Momentum SR Variant Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which consists of stocks\nexhibiting relatively higher momentum\ncharacteristics than the traditional market\ncapitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI\nUSA Index (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), as\ndetermined by MSCI Inc. (the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ). The Parent Index includes\nU.S. large- and mid-capitalization stocks, as\ndefined by MSCI. The Underlying Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of an\nequity momentum strategy by emphasizing stocks\nwith high price momentum, while maintaining\nreasonably high trading liquidity, investment\ncapacity and moderate index turnover, each as\ndetermined by the Index Provider. MSCI uses an\nalgorithm to determine the components in the\nUnderlying Index based on the number of\nconstituents in the Parent Index. A risk-\nadjusted price momentum metric, defined by\nMSCI as the excess return over the risk-free\nrate ( i.e. , the 3 Month Treasury Bill Rate)\ndivided by the annualized standard deviation\nof weekly returns over the past three years,\nis calculated for each security in the Parent\nIndex over 6- and 12-month time periods. The\n6- and 12-month risk-adjusted price momentum\ncalculations are then standardized at +/- 3\nstandard deviations and translated into an\naverage momentum score. MSCI selects the 125\nsecurities with the highest positive momentum\nscores for inclusion in the Underlying Index.\nThe weight of each Underlying Index\nconstituent is determined by multiplying the\nsecurity\u2019s momentum score by its market\ncapitalization weight in the Parent Index.\nAdditionally, a capping methodology is applied\nso that each individual issuer is capped at 5%\nweight at reconstitution. The Index Provider\nalso takes into account certain\ndiversification rules. At reconstitution, if\nthe aggregate weight of stocks representing\nmore than 4.5% weight is greater than 22.5% of\nthe Underlying Index weight, the Underlying\nIndex is rebalanced such that the aggregate\nweight of stocks greater than 4.5% does not\nexceed 22.5% of the Underlying Index weight.\nBetween reconstitution dates, if the aggregate\nweight of stocks representing more than 5%\nweight is greater than 25% of the Underlying\nIndex weight, the Underlying Index is\nrebalanced such that the aggregate weight of\nstocks greater than 4.5% does not exceed 22.5%\nof the Underlying Index weight. The Underlying\nIndex is reconstituted quarterly. To determine\nthe constituent changes at each quarterly\nreconstitution, the Index Provider applies an\niterative algorithm to cap the one-way\nturnover per reconstitution at 30%. As of July\n31, 2024, there were 125 securities in the\nUnderlying Index. As of July 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nfinancials, industrials and technology\nindustries or sectors. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by MSCI, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, S-15 including the principal risks\nnoted below, any of which may adversely affect\nthe Fund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d\n), trading price, yield, total return and\nability to meet its investment objective.\nCertain key risks are prioritized below (with\nothers following in alphabetical order), but\nthe relative significance of any risk is\ndifficult to predict and may change over time.\nYou should review each risk factor carefully.\nRisk of Investing in the U.S . Investing in\nU.S. issuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Momentum Securities\nRisk . Securities that previously exhibited\ngreater momentum characteristics than other\nsecurities may not continue to experience\npositive momentum, and such a change could\noccur quickly. Momentum securities may\nexperience more volatility than the market as\na whole, and their returns may be less than\nthe returns of other styles of investing or\nthe overall stock market. The Fund may\nexperience significant losses if momentum\nstops, reverses or otherwise behaves\ndifferently than predicted. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer as well as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, S-16 legislative and regulatory\nchanges, government spending policies, and\nchanges in domestic and international\neconomies. Issuer Risk . The performance of\nthe Fund depends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other assets to which\nthe Fund has exposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-17\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Index returns beginning on\nNovember 23, 2020 reflect the performance of\nthe MSCI USA Momentum SR Variant Index, which,\neffective as of November 23, 2020, replaced\nthe MSCI USA Momentum Index as the Underlying\nIndex of the Fund. After-tax returns in the\ntable above are calculated using the\nhistorical highest individual U.S. federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state or local taxes. Actual\nafter-tax returns depend on an investor\u2019s tax\nsituation and may differ from those shown, and\nafter-tax returns shown are not relevant to\ntax-exempt investors or investors who hold\nshares through tax-deferred arrangements, such\nas 401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ). Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares are calculated assuming that an\ninvestor has sufficient capital gains of the\nsame character from other investments to\noffset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-18\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2013. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only\nbe bought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-19\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI USA QUALITY FACTOR ETF Ticker:\nQUAL Stock Exchange: Cboe BZX Investment\nObjective The iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the\ninvestment results of an index composed of\nU.S. large- and mid-capitalization stocks with\nquality characteristics as identified through\ncertain fundamental metrics. Fees and Expenses\nThe following table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $15         $48      $85      $192  \n                                      \nS-20\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 31% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI USA Sector Neutral Quality Index (the\n\u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which is based on a\ntraditional market capitalization-weighted\nparent index, the MSCI USA Index (the \u201c Parent\nIndex \u201d ). The Parent Index includes U.S.\nlarge- and mid-capitalization stocks, as\ndefined by MSCI Inc. (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d\nor \u201c MSCI \u201d ). The Underlying Index seeks to\nmeasure the performance of securities in the\nParent Index that exhibit higher quality\ncharacteristics relative to their peers within\nthe corresponding Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) sector. To\nconstruct the Underlying Index, the Index\nProvider determines the quality score of each\nsecurity in the Parent Index based on three\nfundamental variables: high return on equity,\nlow earnings variability and low leverage. The\nUnderlying Index is weighted based on a\ncomponent's quality score multiplied by its\nweight in the Parent Index. Weights in the\nUnderlying Index are next normalized so that\nsectors in the Underlying Index represent the\nsame weight as in the Parent Index.\nAdditionally, each individual issuer is capped\nat 5%. The Underlying Index is rebalanced on a\nsemi-annual basis. As of July 31, 2024, there\nwere 125 securities in the Underlying Index.\nAs of July 31, 2024, a significant portion of\nthe Underlying Index is represented by\nsecurities of companies in the technology\nindustry or sector. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by MSCI, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Quality Securities\nRisk . Securities that previously exhibited\ngreater quality characteristics than other\nsecurities may not continue to be quality\nsecurities. Many factors can impact a\nsecurity\u2019s quality and performance, and such\nfactors and their impact may be difficult to\npredict. The returns of quality securities may\nbe less than the returns of other styles of\ninvesting or the overall stock market. S-21\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The S-22 Fund and BFA seek\nto reduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions.

The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

After-tax returns in the table above are\ncalculated using the historical highest\nindividual U.S. federal marginal income tax\nrates and do not reflect the impact of state\nor local taxes. Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-24\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2013. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to\nas an \u201c ETF \u201d ). Individual shares of the Fund\nmay only be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer. Because ETF\nshares trade at market prices rather than at\nNAV, shares may trade at a price greater than\nNAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount).\nAn investor may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of\nthe Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller\nis willing to accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ).\nTax Information The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-25\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI USA SIZE FACTOR ETF Ticker:\nSIZE Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment\nObjective The iShares MSCI USA Size Factor ETF\n(the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment\nresults of an index composed of U.S. large-\nand mid-capitalization stocks with relatively\nsmaller average market capitalization.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $15         $48      $85      $192  \n                                      \nS-26\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 19% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI USA Low Size Index (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ), which is based on a traditional\nmarket capitalization-weighted parent index,\nthe MSCI USA Index (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ).\nThe Parent Index includes U.S. large- and mid-\ncapitalization stocks, as defined by MSCI Inc.\n(the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index seeks to achieve a low size\nexposure, where \u201c low size \u201d refers to a\nrelatively smaller capitalization within the\nmarket capitalization range of the Parent\nIndex. The Underlying Index is constructed by\napplying a mathematical formula at each\nrebalancing that reweights the components of\nits market capitalization-weighted Parent\nIndex, such that the representation of smaller\ncapitalization companies is increased relative\nto larger capitalization companies. In\naddition, at each rebalancing, the Index\nProvider calculates a \u201c constraint factor \u201d\nfor each component. The constraint factor is\nthe ratio of the component\u2019s weight in the\nUnderlying Index to that component\u2019s weight in\nthe Parent Index. The constraint factor is\nheld constant between each rebalancing, except\nin the case of corporate events (as defined by\nthe Index Provider). Changes in the relative\nweight of an individual component in the\nParent Index due to market\nappreciation/depreciation result in that\ncomponent increasing/decreasing in weight in\nthe Underlying Index to hold the constraint\nfactor for that component constant between\neach rebalancing. The Underlying Index is\nrebalanced semi-annually in May and November.\nAs of July 31, 2024, there are 601 component\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. As of July\n31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the financials, industrials\nand technology industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by MSCI, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. S-27 Low Size\nSecurities Risk . Low size companies, ( i.e .,\nsmaller-capitalized companies within the\nFund\u2019s capitalization range) may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. Low size securities may be more\nvolatile and less liquid than securities on\nthe larger end of the Fund\u2019s capitalization\nrange. As a result, the Fund\u2019s share price may\nbe more volatile than that of a fund with a\ngreater investment in the securities of\nrelatively larger-capitalized companies.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The S-28 performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Technology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions.

Index returns beginning on December 3,\n2018 reflect the performance of the MSCI USA\nLow Size Index, which, effective as of\nDecember 3, 2018, replaced the MSCI USA Risk\nWeighted Index as the Underlying Index of the\nFund. After-tax returns in the table above are\ncalculated using the historical highest\nindividual U.S. federal marginal income tax\nrates and do not reflect the impact of state\nor local taxes. Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-30\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2013. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to\nas an \u201c ETF \u201d ). Individual shares of the Fund\nmay only be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer. Because ETF\nshares trade at market prices rather than at\nNAV, shares may trade at a price greater than\nNAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount).\nAn investor may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of\nthe Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller\nis willing to accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ).\nTax Information The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-31\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI USA SMALL-CAP\nMIN VOL FACTOR ETF Ticker: SMMV Stock\nExchange: Cboe BZX Investment Objective The\niShares MSCI USA Small-Cap Min Vol Factor ETF\n(the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment\nresults of an index composed of small-\ncapitalization U.S. equities that, in the\naggregate, have lower volatility\ncharacteristics relative to the small-\ncapitalization U.S. equity market. Fees and\nExpenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $20         $64     $113      $255  \n                                      \nS-32\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 44% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI USA Small Cap Minimum Volatility\n(USD) Index (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which\nhas been developed by MSCI Inc. (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ) to measure the\nperformance of small-capitalization U.S.\nequities that in the aggregate are expected to\nhave lower volatility characteristics relative\nto the small-capitalization U.S. equity\nmarket. In constructing the Underlying Index,\nMSCI uses a rules-based methodology to select\nsecurities from the MSCI USA Small Cap Index\n(the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), which is a\ncapitalization-weighted index that represents\napproximately 14% of the free float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization in the U.S., and to\ndetermine the weightings of such securities in\nthe Underlying Index. Under the rules-based\nmethodology, securities and weightings of the\nUnderlying Index are established based on pre-\nestablished parameters and discretionary\nfactors are not relied on. Generally, the\nrules-based methodology includes specified\nrequirements for security eligibility, maximum\nand minimum weightings by security and, in\nsome cases, by sector and country, as well as\nrules for special dividends and other\ndistributions and the treatment of corporate\nevents. In order to determine weightings of\nsecurities within the Underlying Index, MSCI\nseeks to optimize the Parent Index such that\nthe resulting portfolio exhibits the lowest\nabsolute volatility, as measured by MSCI,\nwhile applying constraints based on turnover,\nestablished minimum and maximum weightings of\nindex constituents and sectors, as well as\nfactor constraints (for example, liquidity and\nfinancial leverage) as measured by MSCI. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the financials and healthcare\nindustries or sectors. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by MSCI, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Small-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk . Compared to mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies, small-capitalization\ncompanies may be less stable and more\nsusceptible to adverse developments. The\nsecurities of small-capitalization companies\nmay be more volatile and less liquid than\nthose of mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies. As a result, the Fund\u2019s share price\nmay be more volatile than that of a fund with\na greater investment in large- or mid-\ncapitalization stocks. Low Volatility Risk . A\nlow volatility strategy may underperform the\nbroader market during periods of strong,\nrising or speculative stock prices. In\naddition, there is a risk that the Fund may\nexperience more than minimum volatility.\nSecurities in the Fund\u2019s S-33 portfolio may be\nsubject to price volatility, and their prices\nmay not be less volatile (and could be more\nvolatile) than the market as a whole, which\ncould adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nHealthcare Companies Risk . The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, the\nprotection and expiration of patents, limited\nproduct lines, supply chain issues, labor\nshortages and product liability claims, among\nother factors. Issuer Risk . The performance\nof the Fund depends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other assets to which\nthe Fund has exposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s S-34 service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-35\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-36\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2016. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to\nas an \u201c ETF \u201d ). Individual shares of the Fund\nmay only be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer. Because ETF\nshares trade at market prices rather than at\nNAV, shares may trade at a price greater than\nNAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount).\nAn investor may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of\nthe Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller\nis willing to accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ).\nTax Information The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-37\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI USA VALUE\nFACTOR ETF Ticker: VLUE Stock Exchange: Cboe\nBZX Investment Objective The iShares MSCI USA\nValue Factor ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to\ntrack the investment results of an index\ncomposed of U.S. large- and mid-capitalization\nstocks with value characteristics and\nrelatively lower valuations.

The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $15         $48      $85      $192  \n                                      \nS-38\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 24% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which is based on a\ntraditional market capitalization-weighted\nparent index, the MSCI USA Index (the \u201c Parent\nIndex \u201d ). The Parent Index includes U.S.\nlarge- and mid-capitalization stocks, as\ndefined by MSCI Inc. (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d\nor \u201c MSCI \u201d ). The Underlying Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of\nsecurities in the Parent Index that exhibit\nhigher value characteristics relative to their\npeers within the corresponding Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) sector. To\nconstruct the Underlying Index, the Index\nProvider calculates a \u201c value score \u201d for each\nsecurity in the Parent Index using three\nvariables: price-to-book value, price-to-\nforward earnings and enterprise value-to-cash\nflow from operations. MSCI assigns weights by\nmultiplying a component's value score by its\nmarket capitalization. Weights in the\nUnderlying Index are next normalized so that\nsectors in the Underlying Index represent the\nsame weight as in the Parent Index. MSCI uses\nan algorithm to determine the number of\ncomponents in the Underlying Index based on\nthe number of constituents in the Parent\nIndex. The number of components is evaluated\nsemi-annually. As of July 31, 2024, there were\n150 securities in the Underlying Index. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the technology industry or\nsector. The components of the Underlying Index\nare likely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by MSCI, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Value Securities Risk\n. Value securities are those issued by\ncompanies that may be perceived as\nundervalued. Such securities may decline in\nprice or fail to appreciate for long periods\nof time, and they may never realize their full\npotential value. Value securities may\nunderperform growth securities and other types\nof assets as well as the overall stock market.\nValue securities may go in and out of favor\nover time, which could affect the performance\nof the Fund. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. S-39\nMarket Risk . The Fund could lose money over\nshort periods due to short-term market\nmovements and over longer periods during more\nprolonged market downturns. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. S-40 Technology Companies Risk .\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources, supply chains and personnel. These\ncompanies typically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-41\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Index returns beginning on September 1,\n2015 reflect the performance of the MSCI USA\nEnhanced Value Index, which, effective as of\nSeptember 1, 2015, replaced the MSCI USA Value\nWeighted Index as the Underlying Index of the\nFund. After-tax returns in the table above are\ncalculated using the historical highest\nindividual U.S. federal marginal income tax\nrates and do not reflect the impact of state\nor local taxes. Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-42\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2013. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to\nas an \u201c ETF \u201d ). Individual shares of the Fund\nmay only be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer. Because ETF\nshares trade at market prices rather than at\nNAV, shares may trade at a price greater than\nNAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount).\nAn investor may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of\nthe Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller\nis willing to accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ).\nTax Information The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $8          $26      $45      $103  \n                                      \nS-44\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 21% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe STOXX U.S. Equity Factor Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which is a rules-based\nequity index provided by STOXX Ltd. (the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d or \u201c STOXX \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index is composed of large- and\nmid-capitalization equity securities from the\nSTOXX USA 900 index (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d )\nthat are selected and weighted using an\noptimization process designed to maximize\nexposure to five target factors: momentum,\nquality, value, low volatility and size. The\nUnderlying Index also seeks to mitigate\nexposure to unintended systematic exposures,\nlimit turnover and maintain a level of risk\nsimilar to that of the Parent Index. The\nParent Index measures the performance of the\nlargest 900 companies of the U.S. equity\nmarket, as defined by the Index Provider. The\nmomentum score is calculated from the\nfollowing signals: price momentum, earnings\nmomentum and earnings announcement drift (\ni.e. , the difference between a stock\u2019s\nperformance on and immediately following an\nearnings announcement date). The quality score\nis calculated from the following signals:\ngross profitability, share dilution, accruals,\nchanges in net operating assets, carbon\nemissions intensity and greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG\n\u201d ) reduction targets. Carbon emissions\nintensity is based on the issuer\u2019s Scope 1 and\nScope 2 GHG emissions ( i.e. , direct\nemissions from sources that an issuer owns or\ncontrols and indirect emissions from the\nissuer\u2019s purchase of energy) relative to peers\nin its Industry Classification Benchmark ( \u201c\nICB \u201d ) Supersector, as reported by\nInstitutional Shareholder Services ( \u201c ISS \u201d\n). The GHG targets signal is based on the\nrobustness of an issuer's GHG reduction\ntargets, including whether they are part of\nthe Science Based Targets initiative ( \u201c SBTi\n\u201d ) framework; this is assessed by ISS based\non its own ESG ratings data and SBTi data. The\nvalue score is calculated from the following\nsignals: current book value-to-price ratio,\ndividend yield ( i.e. , 12-month trailing\ndividend divided by total market\ncapitalization), earnings yield ( i.e. ,\n12-month net income divided by total market\ncapitalization), cash flow yield ( i.e. ,\n12-month cash flow divided by total market\ncapitalization) and time series normalized\ncash flow yield over the previous 36 months.\nThe low volatility score is based on prior\n12-month volatility, as calculated by the\nIndex Provider. The size score seeks to\nmeasure an issuer\u2019s market capitalization\nrelative to other companies in the Parent\nIndex. The maximum weight of a single security\nis 10%, and the sum of security weights that\nare individually greater than 4.5% must be\nless than 22.5% of the Underlying Index. The\nIndex Provider also applies other constraints,\nsuch as sector exposures relative to the\nParent Index, among others. The Underlying\nIndex is reviewed and rebalanced quarterly. As\nof July 31, 2024, the Underlying Index\nconsisted of approximately 279 constituents,\nand a significant portion of the Underlying\nIndex is represented by securities of\ncompanies in the consumer discretionary and\ntechnology industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by STOXX, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment S-45 (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Style Factors Risk .\nEach of the five equity style factors ( i.e .,\nmomentum, quality, value, low volatility and\nlow size) that determine the weight of each\ncomponent security in the Underlying Index has\ncharacteristics that may cause the Fund to\nunderperform the Parent Index or the market as\na whole. Momentum Factor Risk . Securities\nthat previously exhibited greater momentum\ncharacteristics may not continue to experience\npositive momentum, and such a change could\noccur quickly. Momentum securities may\nexperience more volatility than the market as\na whole. Quality Factor Risk . Securities that\npreviously exhibited greater quality\ncharacteristics than other securities may not\ncontinue to be quality securities. Many\nfactors can impact a security\u2019s quality and\nperformance, and such factors and their impact\nmay be difficult to predict. Value Factor Risk\n. Value securities are those issued by\ncompanies that may be perceived as\nundervalued. Such securities may decline in\nprice or fail to appreciate for long periods\nof time, and they may never realize their full\npotential value. Low Volatility Factor Risk .\nLow volatility securities may underperform the\nbroader market during periods of strong,\nrising or speculative stock prices. The prices\nof such securities may not be any less\nvolatile (and could be more volatile) than the\nmarket as a whole. Low Size Factor Risk .\nCompanies with relatively smaller market\ncapitalization within the Fund\u2019s\ncapitalization range may be less stable and\nmore susceptible to adverse developments. Low\nsize securities may be more volatile and less\nliquid than securities on the larger end of\nthe Fund\u2019s capitalization range. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components or\nwill result in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. S-46 Consumer Goods\nand Services Companies Risk. Consumer goods\nand services companies ( \u201c consumer companies\n\u201d ) face risks related to changes in consumer\npreferences and disposable income, commodity\nprices, government regulation, supply chain\ndisruptions, damage to brand or reputation,\neconomic slowdown and labor shortages, among\nother things. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. ESG Risk. To the\nextent that the Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. The Underlying Index\u2019s use\nof ESG criteria may result in the Fund\ninvesting in, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Issuer Risk . The performance of\nthe Fund depends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other assets to which\nthe Fund has exposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nS-47 to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-48\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Index returns beginning\non June 1, 2022 reflect the performance of the\nSTOXX U.S. Equity Factor Index, which,\neffective as of June 1, 2022, replaced the\nMSCI USA Diversified Multiple-Factor Index as\nthe Underlying Index of the Fund. After-tax\nreturns in the table above are calculated\nusing the historical highest individual U.S.\nfederal marginal income tax rates and do not\nreflect the impact of state or local taxes.\nActual after-tax returns depend on an\ninvestor\u2019s tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown, and after-tax returns shown are\nnot relevant to tax-exempt investors or\ninvestors who hold shares through tax-deferred\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-49\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2015. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to\nas an \u201c ETF \u201d ). Individual shares of the Fund\nmay only be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer. Because ETF\nshares trade at market prices rather than at\nNAV, shares may trade at a price greater than\nNAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount).\nAn investor may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of\nthe Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller\nis willing to accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ).\nTax Information The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-50\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. SMALL-CAP\nEQUITY FACTOR ETF Ticker: SMLF Stock Exchange:\nNYSE Arca Investment Objective The iShares\nU.S. Small-Cap Equity Factor ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d\n) seeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of U.S. small-capitalization\nstocks that have favorable exposure to target\nstyle factors subject to constraints. Fees and\nExpenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $15         $48      $85      $192  \n                                      \nS-51\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 23% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe STOXX U.S. Small-Cap Equity Factor Index\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which is a rules-\nbased equity index provided by STOXX Ltd. (the\n\u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c STOXX \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index is composed of small-\ncapitalization equity securities from the\nSTOXX US Small Cap Index (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d\n) that are selected and weighted using an\noptimization process designed to maximize\nexposure to four target factors: momentum,\nquality, value, and low volatility. The\nUnderlying Index seeks to control exposure to,\namong other things, industries, limit turnover\nand maintain a level of risk similar to that\nof the Parent Index. The Parent Index is a\nfree float market capitalization-weighted\nindex designed to measure the performance of\nsmall-capitalization companies in the U.S.\nSmall capitalization companies, as calculated\nby the Index Provider, represent approximately\nthe bottom 15% of the investable market\ncapitalization in the U.S. securities market,\nas determined by STOXX. The momentum score is\ncalculated from the following signals: price\nmomentum, earnings momentum and earnings\nannouncement drift ( i.e. , the difference\nbetween a stock\u2019s performance on and\nimmediately following an earnings announcement\ndate). The quality score is calculated from\nthe following signals: gross profitability,\nshare dilution, accruals, changes in net\noperating assets, carbon emissions intensity\nand greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG \u201d ) reduction\ntargets. Carbon emissions intensity is based\non the issuer\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG\nemissions ( i.e ., direct emissions from\nsources that an issuer owns or controls and\nindirect emissions from the issuer\u2019s purchase\nof energy) relative to peers in its Industry\nClassification Benchmark ( \u201c ICB \u201d )\nSupersector, as reported by Institutional\nShareholder Services ( \u201c ISS \u201d ). The GHG\ntargets signal is based on the robustness of\nan issuer\u2019s GHG reduction targets, including\nwhether they are part of the Science Based\nTargets initiative ( \u201c SBTi \u201d ) framework;\nthis is assessed by ISS based on its own ESG\nratings data and SBTi data. The value score is\ncalculated from the following signals: current\nbook value-to-price ratio, dividend yield (\ni.e ., 12-month trailing dividend divided by\ntotal market capitalization), earnings yield (\ni.e. , 12-month net income divided by total\nmarket capitalization), cash flow yield ( i.e.\n, 12-month cash flow divided by total market\ncapitalization) and time series normalized\ncash flow yield over the previous 36 months.\nThe low volatility score is based on prior 12\nmonth volatility, as calculated by the Index\nProvider. The maximum weight of a single\nsecurity is 10%, and the sum of security\nweights that are individually greater than\n4.5% must be less than 22.5% of the Underlying\nIndex. The Index Provider also applies other\nconstraints, such as country and sector\nexposures relative to the Parent Index, among\nothers. The Underlying Index is reviewed and\nrebalanced quarterly. As of July 31, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index consisted of approximately\n832 constituents, and a significant portion of\nthe Underlying Index is represented by\nsecurities of companies in the consumer\ndiscretionary, financials and industrials\nindustries or sectors. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex are sponsored by STOXX, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and Parent Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index and Parent\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the S-52 same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow, any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Small-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk . Compared to mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies, small-capitalization\ncompanies may be less stable and more\nsusceptible to adverse developments. The\nsecurities of small-capitalization companies\nmay be more volatile and less liquid than\nthose of mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies. As a result, the Fund\u2019s share price\nmay be more volatile than that of a fund with\na greater investment in large- or mid-\ncapitalization stocks. Style Factors Risk .\nEach of the four equity style factors ( i.e .,\nmomentum, quality, value and low volatility)\nthat determine the weight of each component\nsecurity in the Underlying Index has\ncharacteristics that may cause the Fund to\nunderperform the Parent Index or the market as\na whole. Momentum Factor Risk . Securities\nthat previously exhibited greater momentum\ncharacteristics may not continue to experience\npositive momentum, and such a change could\noccur quickly. Momentum securities may\nexperience more volatility than the market as\na whole. Quality Factor Risk . Securities that\npreviously exhibited greater quality\ncharacteristics than other securities may not\ncontinue to be quality securities. Many\nfactors can impact a security\u2019s quality and\nperformance, and such factors and their impact\nmay be difficult to predict. Value Factor Risk\n. Value securities are those issued by\ncompanies that may be perceived as\nundervalued. Such securities may decline in\nprice or fail to appreciate for long periods\nof time, and they may never realize their full\npotential value. Low Volatility Factor Risk .\nLow volatility securities may underperform the\nbroader market during periods of strong,\nrising or speculative stock prices. The prices\nof such securities may not be any less\nvolatile (and could be more volatile) than the\nmarket as a whole. Equity Securities Risk .\nEquity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue, and their values may be more volatile\nthan those of other asset classes. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of\nreasons that may directly relate to the issuer\nas well as due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components or will\nresult in the Fund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nS-53 to the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments\nare concentrated in the securities or other\nassets of one or more issuers, countries or\nother geographic units, markets, industries,\nproject types, or asset classes. Consumer\nGoods and Services Companies Risk. Consumer\ngoods and services companies ( \u201c consumer\ncompanies \u201d ) face risks related to changes in\nconsumer preferences and disposable income,\ncommodity prices, government regulation,\nsupply chain disruptions, damage to brand or\nreputation, economic slowdown and labor\nshortages, among other things. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. ESG Risk. To the\nextent that the Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. The Underlying Index\u2019s use\nof ESG criteria may result in the Fund\ninvesting in, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Financial Companies Risk .\nFinancial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation and\nintervention, which may adversely affect their\nprofitability, the scope of their activities,\nthe prices they can charge, the amount of\ncapital and liquid assets they must maintain\nand their size, among other things. Financial\nservices companies also may be significantly\naffected by, among other things, interest\nrates, economic conditions, volatility in\nfinancial markets, credit rating downgrades,\nadverse public perception, exposure\nconcentration and counterparty risk.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index S-54 does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions.

The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown. The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index.Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

Index\nreturns beginning on March 1, 2023 reflect the\nperformance of the STOXX U.S. Small-Cap Equity\nFactor Index, which, effective as of March 1,\n2023, replaced the MSCI USA Small Cap\nDiversified Multiple-Factor Index as the\nUnderlying Index of the Fund. After-tax\nreturns in the table above are calculated\nusing the historical highest individual U.S.\nfederal marginal income tax rates and do not\nreflect the impact of state or local taxes.\nActual after-tax returns depend on an\ninvestor\u2019s tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown, and after-tax returns shown are\nnot relevant to tax-exempt investors or\ninvestors who hold shares through tax-deferred\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-56\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr.\nSavage have been Portfolio Managers of the\nFund since 2015. Mr. Whitehead has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to\nas an \u201c ETF \u201d ). Individual shares of the Fund\nmay only be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer. Because ETF\nshares trade at market prices rather than at\nNAV, shares may trade at a price greater than\nNAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount).\nAn investor may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of\nthe Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller\nis willing to accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ).\nTax Information The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-57\n\nMore Information About the Funds This\nProspectus contains important information\nabout investing in the Funds listed below.\nPlease read this Prospectus carefully before\nyou make any investment decisions.

that trade like other publicly\ntraded securities. Shares of each Fund are\nlisted on a national securities exchange and\ntrade in the secondary market at market prices\nthat change throughout the day. The market\nprice for a share of a Fund may be different\nfrom the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. Each Fund\ninvests in a particular segment of the markets\nfor securities and other instruments (as\napplicable) and is designed to be used as part\nof broader asset allocation strategies.\nAccordingly, an investment in a Fund should\nnot constitute a complete investment program.\nAn investment in a Fund is not a bank deposit,\nand it is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, any\nother government agency, BFA or any of BFA\u2019s\naffiliates.\n\n1\n\nIndex Funds A share of a Fund represents an\nownership interest in an underlying portfolio\nof securities and other instruments (as\napplicable) that is intended to track the\nFund\u2019s Underlying Index. An index is a\nfinancial calculation, based on a grouping of\nfinancial instruments, and is not an\ninvestment product, while each Fund is an\nactual investment portfolio. The performance\nof a Fund and that of its Underlying Index may\nvary for a number of reasons, including\ntransaction costs, asset or currency\nvaluations, corporate actions, timing\nvariances and differences between the\ncomposition of a Fund\u2019s portfolio and that of\nthe Underlying Index resulting from the Fund\u2019s\nuse of representative sampling or from legal\nrestrictions (such as diversification\nrequirements) that apply to the Fund but not\nto its Underlying Index. From time to time,\nthe provider of the Underlying Index ( \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ) may make changes to the index\nmethodology or other adjustments to a Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index. Unless otherwise determined\nby BFA, any such change will be reflected in\nthe calculation of the Underlying Index\u2019s\nperformance on a going-forward basis after the\neffective date of such change. Therefore, the\nperformance of the Underlying Index that is\nshown for periods prior to the effective date\nof any such change generally will not be\nrecalculated or restated to reflect the\nchange. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Funds. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of the applicable underlying index.\nBecause the Funds use representative sampling,\nthey can be expected to have a larger tracking\nerror than if they used a replication indexing\nstrategy. \u201c Replication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests in\nsubstantially all of the securities in its\nunderlying index in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying index. 2\n\nAdditional Information About the Funds' Risks\nEach Fund is subject to various risks, any of\nwhich may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV,\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Each Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. You could lose all or part of\nyour investment in a Fund, which could\nunderperform other investments. The table\nbelow identifies the principal and other (non-\nprincipal) risks that apply to each Fund. A\nFund that invests in an Underlying Fund also\nmay be indirectly exposed to these risks\nthrough such investment. A description of each\nrisk is provided after the table.\n                                              \n       iSh\u2026  iSha\u2026                     iSha\u2026  \n       ESG\u2026  MSCI\u2026

The securities and other\nassets in a Fund\u2019s portfolio or, if\napplicable, its Underlying Index may\nunderperform in comparison to indexes that\ntrack, or assets that represent, other\ncountries or geographic units, industries,\nmarkets, market segments, or asset classes.\nVarious types of securities, other assets and\nindexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and underperformance in\ncomparison to financial markets generally.\nThis divergence may be due to a number of\nfactors including, among other things,\ninflation, interest rates, productivity,\nglobal demand for local products or resources,\nand regulation and governmental controls. This\nmay cause a Fund to underperform other\ninvestment vehicles that invest in different\nasset classes. Assets Under Management (AUM)\nRisk. From time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant, a third-party investor, a Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of a Fund\u2019s adviser, or\nanother fund may invest in a Fund and hold its\ninvestment for a specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such entity would\nnot redeem its investment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at such levels,\nwhich could negatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk.\nOnly an Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith a Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for a Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk may be\nheightened for a Fund that invests in\nsecurities issued by non-U.S. issuers or\ninstruments with lower trading volume. Such\nassets often entail greater settlement and\noperational complexity and higher capital\ncosts for Authorized Participants, which may\nlimit the number of Authorized Participants\nthat engage with the Fund. Close-Out Risk for\nQualified Financial Contracts. Regulations\nadopted by global prudential regulators\nrequire counterparties that are part of U.S.\nor foreign global systemically important\nbanking organizations to include contractual\nrestrictions on close-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified financial\ncontracts. Qualified financial contracts\ninclude agreements relating to swaps, currency\nforwards and other derivatives as well as\nrepurchase agreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions prevent a Fund\nfrom closing out a qualified financial\ncontract during a specified time period if the\ncounterparty is subject to resolution\nproceedings and also prohibit a Fund from\nexercising default rights due to a\nreceivership or similar proceeding of an\naffiliate of the counterparty. These\nrequirements may increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. Communication Services\nSector Risk. The communication services sector\nconsists of both companies in the\ntelecommunication services industry as well as\nthose in the media and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the telecommunication\nservices industry group include providers of\nfiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services and products\nincluding television broadcasting, gaming\nproducts, social media, networking platforms,\nonline classifieds, online review websites,\nand Internet search engines. Companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be affected\nby industry competition, substantial capital\nrequirements, government regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications products and\nservices due to technological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and international demand,\nshifting demographics and often unpredictable\nchanges in consumer tastes can drastically\naffect a communication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular\n\n5\n\ntargets of hacking and potential theft of\nproprietary or consumer information or\ndisruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Concentration Risk. A Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. A Fund with investment concentration\nmay be more adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets, may\nexperience greater price volatility and may be\nmore susceptible to adverse economic, market,\npolitical or regulatory impacts on those\nassets compared to a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments. Consumer Goods\nand Services Companies Risk. Many consumer\ngoods and services companies ( \u201c consumer\ncompanies \u201d ) rely heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending and may\nbe impacted by social trends, marketing\ncampaigns, demographic shifts and other\nfactors affecting consumer preferences and\ndemand. In addition, damage to a brand or a\nreputation crisis can have a substantial\nadverse impact on consumer companies. Certain\nconsumer companies, such as those providing\ndiscretionary goods or services, may depend\nmore on business cycles, overall economic\nconditions and consumer confidence. Many\nconsumer goods and services are subject to\ngovernment regulation and the related\ncompliance costs, and consumer companies also\nface the risk of product liability claims.\nConsumer companies also may be adversely\naffected by volatility in commodity prices,\nsupply chain disruptions and labor shortages.\nCybersecurity Risk. A Fund and entities that\ninteract with the Fund are susceptible to\noperational, information security and related\ncybersecurity risks, both directly and through\ntheir service providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, distributor, other service providers\n( e.g ., index and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer agents and\nadministrators), counterparties, market\nmakers, Authorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market operators,\nand governmental authorities. Cybersecurity\nrisks are also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in which a Fund\ninvests, which could result in material\nadverse consequences for such issuers and may\ncause the Fund\u2019s investment in such issuers to\nlose value. Cyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or unintentional events.\nThey include, but are not limited to, gaining\nunauthorized access to systems,\nmisappropriating assets or sensitive\ninformation, corrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational disruption.\nGeopolitical tensions may increase the scale\nand sophistication of deliberate attacks,\nparticularly those from nation-states or from\nentities with nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions\nand impact business operations and may result\nin any of the following: financial losses,\ninterference with a Fund\u2019s ability to\ncalculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to trading,\nsubmission of erroneous trades or erroneous\ncreation or redemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service providers to transact\nbusiness, violations of applicable privacy and\nother laws, regulatory fines, penalties,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other legal and\ncompliance expenses. In addition, cyber\nincidents may render records of Fund assets\nand transactions, shareholder ownership of\nFund shares, and other data integral to a\nFund\u2019s functioning inaccessible, inaccurate or\nincomplete. A Fund may incur substantial costs\nin order to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. 6 Each Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans in the event of, and\nrisk management systems to prevent, cyber\nincidents. However, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that prevention and\nremediation efforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go undetected.\nFurthermore, a Fund cannot control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and other third\nparties whose activities affect the Fund. A\nFund and its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Energy Companies Risk.\nThe energy sector tends to be closely tied to\nthe economic cycle and can be significantly\naffected by supply-demand dynamics and\nvolatility in commodity prices. Energy\ncompanies also may be adversely affected by\nexchange rate fluctuations, war or other\nconflicts, sanctions, import/export controls,\ndepletion of resources, technological advances\nand labor relations. This sector generally is\nsubject to substantial government regulation,\nand companies may incur significant costs in\ncomplying with environmental and other laws.\nPolicies that promote energy conservation,\nclean energy or the transition to low carbon\nalternatives also may affect the performance\nof energy companies. Energy companies may\ndepend on a relatively small number of\ncustomers, including governmental entities and\nutilities. The exploration and production of\nenergy sources and the development of energy\ninfrastructure often require significant\ncapital expenditures, and companies may face\nhigh interest costs and difficulty in raising\ncapital. Energy companies also may face\nchallenges from operating in countries with a\nhistory of adverse policies or events, such as\nexpropriation, confiscation of assets,\ncorruption, political instability and social\nunrest. The operations of energy companies may\nbe disrupted by events that target or damage\nenergy infrastructure, including cyber or\nother attacks, accidents and natural\ndisasters. Energy companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. The energy sector may\nexperience significant market volatility. For\nexample, Russia\u2019s large-scale invasion of\nUkraine in 2022 led to disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nimposed various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. It is impossible to predict the\neffect of current or future sanctions and\nrestrictions, the extent and duration of the\nconflict, and associated disruptions in the\nenergy sector. The effect of these events or\nany related developments could be significant\nand may have a severe adverse effect on a\nFund\u2019s performance. Equity Securities Risk.\nEquity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue due to general market or economic\nconditions, perceptions about the markets in\nwhich issuers participate or a number of\nfactors relating to a specific issuer.\nInvestments in equity securities may be more\nvolatile than investments in other asset\nclasses. Equity securities (both common and\npreferred stock) are subordinated to debt\nsecurities in a company\u2019s capital structure,\nand so equity holders are generally subject to\nmore risks, particularly in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Common stock has the\nlowest priority and the greatest risks,\nincluding with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments. ESG Risk. To the extent\nthat a Fund\u2019s Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. An Underlying Index\u2019s use of\nESG criteria may result in a Fund investing\nin, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\nthe divergence of a Fund's overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. An Index Provider evaluates\nsecurities for inclusion and/or weighting in\nsuch an Underlying Index based on ESG criteria\nand data provided by the Index Provider or\nthird parties. The Index Provider\u2019s evaluation\nof securities\u2019 ESG characteristics depends on\nthese criteria and data, which may vary by\nindex provider, and no assurance can be given\nthat they will be complete, accurate or\ncurrent. In addition, an Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data (including\nratings) and, if applicable, ESG objectives or\nconstraints that are relevant to an Underlying\nIndex only at index reviews or rebalances.\nSecurities included in an Underlying Index may\ncease to meet the relevant ESG criteria but\nmay nevertheless remain in the Underlying\nIndex and in the Fund using the Underlying\nIndex until the next review or rebalance by\nthe Index Provider. As a result, certain\nsecurities in the Underlying Index, or the\nUnderlying Index as a whole, may not meet the\nrelevant ESG objectives or constraints at all\ntimes. If the ESG assessment of a security in\nan Underlying Index or a Fund changes, neither\nthe Fund nor BFA accepts any liability in\nrelation to such change. BFA does not monitor\nsecurities in an Underlying Index with respect\nto ESG objectives or constraints applied by\nthe Index Provider and is not responsible for\nchanges to the ESG assessment of a security in\nan Underlying Index between rebalances. In\naddition, BFA does not assess the validity of\nan Index Provider\u2019s evaluation of the ESG\ncharacteristics of securities or the criteria\nand data used in such evaluation. The impacts\nof risks related to ESG investing are likely\nto change over time, and new ESG risks may be\nidentified as further data and information\nregarding ESG factors and impacts become\navailable. In addition, methodologies for ESG\ninvesting continue to develop, and the ESG\nmethodology applied by an Index Provider may\nchange over time. Financial Companies Risk.\nFinancial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation and\nintervention, which may change frequently and\nmay adversely affect their profitability, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and liquid\nassets they must maintain and their size,\namong other things. Financial services\ncompanies also may be significantly affected\nby, among other things, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, credit rating downgrades,\nadverse public perception and exposure\nconcentration. Increased risk-taking by\nfinancial companies may result in greater\noverall risk in the global financial sector.\nCertain events may cause an unusually high\ndegree of volatility in financial markets and\npose the risk of large losses for financial\nservices companies. 7 Financial companies\nfrequently operate with substantial financial\nleverage and are exposed directly to the\ncredit risk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, which also may be leveraged to\nan unknown degree. Financial companies may\nhave significant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties; as a result, a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother financial companies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk may result in\nsignificant negative impacts to companies with\ndirect exposure to the defaulting counterparty\nas well as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financial sector generally.\nHealthcare Companies Risk. The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by the following factors, among\nothers: extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, a\nlimited number of products, labor shortages,\nsupply chain issues and industry innovation.\nMany new products in the healthcare sector\nentail significant research and development\nand require regulatory approval, all of which\nmay be long and costly, and such efforts\nultimately may be unsuccessful. Many\nhealthcare companies depend heavily on\nobtaining and defending patents, which can be\ncostly, and may be adversely affected by the\nexpiration of patents. Healthcare companies\nalso are subject to extensive litigation based\non product liability and similar claims.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nAn investment may be illiquid due to, among\nother things, fewer participants or less\ncapacity to make a market in the investment,\nthe lack of an active market for the\ninvestment, capital controls, delays or limits\non repatriation of local currency, and the\ninsolvency of local governments. To the extent\nthat a Fund invests in securities or other\nassets with substantial market and/or credit\nrisk, the Fund will tend to have increased\nexposure to the risks associated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid investments may be\nharder to value, especially in changing\nmarkets. Liquid investments may become\nilliquid after purchase by a Fund,\nparticularly during periods of market turmoil.\nThere can be no assurance that a security or\nother asset that is deemed to be liquid when\npurchased will continue to be liquid for as\nlong as it is held by a Fund, and any security\nor other asset held by a Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk management program. Holdings of\nilliquid investments may reduce a Fund\u2019s\nreturns because the Fund may be unable to\ntransact at advantageous times or prices. If a\nFund is forced to sell underlying investments\nat reduced prices or under unfavorable\nconditions to meet redemption requests or for\nother cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss.\nThis may be magnified in a rising interest\nrate environment or other circumstances where\nredemptions of Fund shares may be greater than\nnormal. If other market participants attempt\nto liquidate holdings at the same time as a\nFund, this will lead to an increased supply of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying investments in the\nmarket and contribute to greater illiquid\ninvestments risk and downward pricing\npressure. In addition, if a Fund is limited in\nits ability to sell illiquid investments\nduring periods when shareholders are redeeming\ntheir shares, the Fund will need to sell\nliquid securities to meet redemption requests,\nand illiquid securities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings. During periods\nof market volatility, liquidity in the market\nfor a Fund\u2019s shares may be impacted by the\nliquidity in the market for the underlying\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund,\nwhich could lead to the Fund\u2019s shares trading\nat a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.\nIndex-Related Risk. A Fund that tracks an\nUnderlying Index seeks to achieve a return\nthat corresponds generally to the price and\nyield performance, before fees and expenses,\nof its Underlying Index as published by the\nIndex Provider. There is no assurance that the\nIndex Provider or its agents will construct or\ncalculate the Underlying Index accurately.\nWhile the Index Provider describes what the\nUnderlying Index is designed to achieve,\nneither the Index Provider nor its agents\nprovide any warranty or accept any liability\nregarding the quality, accuracy or\ncompleteness of the Underlying Index or its\nrelated data, and they do not guarantee that\nthe Underlying Index will be in line with the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology. BFA also does\nnot provide any warranty or guarantee against\nthe Index Provider\u2019s or any agent\u2019s errors.\nThe Index Provider may rely on various sources\nof information to assess the criteria of\ncomponents of the Underlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on assumptions\nand estimates. Neither a Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology or sources of information will\nprovide an accurate assessment of included\ncomponents or will result in the Fund meeting\nits investment objective. Errors in index\ndata, index computations or the construction\nof an Underlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, particularly for indexes that are less\ncommonly used as benchmarks. In addition,\nthere may be heightened risks associated with\nthe adequacy and reliability of information\nabout emerging markets constituents, as such\nmarkets may have less information available or\nless regulatory oversight. Errors related to\nan Underlying Index may negatively or\npositively impact a Fund and its shareholders.\nFor example, if the Underlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund will have\nexposure to such constituents and will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying Index\u2019s other\nconstituents. Shareholders should understand\nthat any gains from an Index Provider\u2019s errors\nwill be kept by the Fund and its shareholders\nand any losses or costs from such errors will\nbe borne by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnusual market conditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural disasters,\npolitical unrest or war) may impact an Index\nProvider or a third-party data provider and\ncould cause the Index Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to an Underlying Index.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. If a\nscheduled rebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that would otherwise be removed\nat the rebalance (due to, for example, changes\nin market capitalization or issuer credit\nratings) may remain, causing the performance\nand constituents of the Underlying Index to\nvary from those expected under normal\nconditions. In addition, to the extent\ncircumstances evolve between periodic index\nreviews and reconstitutions, an Underlying\nIndex may include constituents that do not\nalign with its objective or selection\ncriteria, and the Fund tracking the Underlying\nIndex may be similarly affected. 8 In addition\nto scheduled rebalances, an Index Provider or\nits agents may carry out ad hoc index\nrebalances due to reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market conditions,\ncorporate events, or corrections of errors.\nThe relevant Fund will in turn rebalance its\nportfolio to attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the portfolio and the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund and its\nshareholders will directly bear any\ntransaction costs and market exposure from\nsuch portfolio rebalancing. Therefore, index-\nrelated errors and ad hoc rebalances may\nincrease a Fund\u2019s costs and tracking error.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, third-party vendor\nrisks, cyber attacks, trade disputes, product\nrecalls, liability and environmental damage\nclaims, scarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe products of industrial companies may face\nobsolescence due to technological developments\nand new product introduction. Furthermore,\nchanges in trade restrictions and tariffs as\nwell as broader geopolitical developments\ncould adversely affect industrial companies.\nThese companies also may be significantly\naffected by domestic and international\neconomic conditions, legislative and\nregulatory changes, and labor relations.\nIndustrial companies may depend on public or\nprivate sector financing, which may become\ndifficult to obtain due to government spending\nconstraints or reduced availability of\ncapital. Such companies may be unable to\nprotect their intellectual property rights or\nmay be liable for infringing the intellectual\nproperty rights of others. Issuer Risk. The\nperformance of a Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of a\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or loan Fund\nshares (to secure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party. There can be no\nassurance that any large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment or that the size of a Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares may adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the extent a Fund\npermits redemptions in cash, these redemptions\nmay force the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material effect on the\nmarket price of Fund shares, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains, and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such tax year. A\nFund also may be required to sell its more\nliquid investments to meet a large redemption,\nin which case the Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile, and more\ndifficult to price. To the extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund shares on the\nsecondary market, such transactions may\naccount for a large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may, therefore,\nhave a material upward or downward effect on\nthe market price of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s performance to the extent\nthat the Fund is delayed in investing new cash\nand is required to maintain a larger cash\nposition than it ordinarily would, diluting\nits investment returns. Low Size Securities\nRisk. Investments in low size securities may\nbe riskier, less liquid, more volatile and\nmore susceptible to economic, market and\nindustry changes than investments in the\nsecurities of relatively larger-capitalized\ncompanies. Low size companies may have more\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources, personnel and management experience\nand thus may be more vulnerable to adverse\nbusiness and economic developments. Low size\nsecurities may be more be more volatile and\nless liquid than securities on the larger end\nof a Fund\u2019s capitalization range, and it may\nbe more difficult for a Fund to buy and sell\nthem. As a result, the share price of a Fund\nwith a low size strategy may be more volatile\nthan that of a fund with a greater investment\nin the securities of relatively larger-\ncapitalized companies. Low Volatility Risk. A\nlow volatility strategy may underperform the\nbroader market during periods of strong,\nrising or speculative stock prices. In\naddition, there is a risk that a Fund with\nsuch an investment strategy may experience\nmore than minimum volatility. Securities in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio may be subject to price\nvolatility, and their prices may not be less\nvolatile (and could be more volatile) than the\nmarket as a whole, which could adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s NAV. Management Risk. An\nindex Fund invests in securities or other\nassets included in, or representative of, its\nUnderlying Index, regardless of their\ninvestment merits. Such a Fund may be affected\nby a general decline in market segments\nrelated to its Underlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to invest the\nFund\u2019s assets in defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. Market disruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an adverse effect on a\nFund\u2019s ability to adjust its exposure to the\nrequired levels in order to track its\nUnderlying Index. Because BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy, a\nFund will not fully replicate its Underlying\nIndex and may hold securities or other assets\nnot included in the Underlying Index. As a\nresult, a Fund is subject to the risk that\nBFA\u2019s investment strategy, whose\nimplementation is subject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the intended\nresults. There is no 9 guarantee that a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a high degree of\ncorrelation to those of its Underlying Index\nor that a Fund will achieve its investment\nobjective. Market Risk. A Fund could lose\nmoney over short periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over longer periods\nduring more prolonged market downturns. The\nvalue of a financial instrument or other asset\nmay decline due to changes in general market\nconditions, economic trends or events that are\nnot specifically related to the particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors that affect\none or more issuers, counterparties,\nexchanges, countries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or asset classes.\nLocal, regional or global events such as war,\nacts of terrorism, pandemics or other public\nhealth issues, recessions, the prospect or\noccurrence of a sovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments and could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s NAV. Changes\nin market and economic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all types of\ninstruments and assets. Market Trading Risk. A\nFund faces numerous market trading risks, any\nof which may lead to its shares trading in the\nsecondary market at a premium or discount to\nNAV or to the intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy Fund shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto NAV or sell Fund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a discount to the NAV, you\nmay pay significantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the underlying value\nof the Fund shares. Absence of an Active\nPrimary Market. Although Fund shares are\nlisted for trading on one or more stock\nexchanges, there can be no assurance that an\nactive primary trading market for Fund shares\nwill develop or be maintained by market makers\nor Authorized Participants. Secondary Listing\nRisks. A Fund\u2019s shares may be listed or traded\non U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other\nthan the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing is maintained. Fund shares\nalso may be available to non-U.S. investors\nthrough funds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary receipts. There\ncan be no assurance that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to trade on any such stock exchange\nor in any market or that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to meet the requirements for exchange\nlisting or market trading. A Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe less actively traded in certain markets\nthan in others, and investors are subject to\nthe execution and settlement risks and market\nstandards of the market where they or their\nbroker direct their trades for execution.\nCertain information that is available to\ninvestors who trade Fund shares on a U.S.\nstock exchange during regular U.S. market\nhours may not be available to investors who\ntrade in other markets, which may result in\nsecondary market prices in such markets being\nless efficient. Secondary Market Trading Risk.\nShares of a Fund may trade in the secondary\nmarket at times when the Fund does not accept\norders to create or redeem shares. At such\ntimes, shares may trade in the secondary\nmarket with more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might be experienced at\ntimes when the Fund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities held by a Fund\nmay be traded in markets that close at a\ndifferent time than an exchange on which Fund\nshares are traded. Liquidity in those\nsecurities may be reduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during the time\nwhen the exchange is open but after the\napplicable market closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be wider bid/ask\nspreads on the exchange and a greater premium\nor discount to NAV. In stressed market\nconditions, the market for a Fund\u2019s shares may\nbecome less liquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the markets for the\nFund\u2019s portfolio holdings, and an investor may\nbe unable to sell their Fund shares. Secondary\nmarket trading in Fund shares may be halted by\na stock exchange because of market conditions\nor for other reasons. In times of\nextraordinary market volatility, Fund shares\nmay be subject to trading halts pursuant to \u201c\ncircuit breaker \u201d rules of a stock exchange or\nmarket. If there is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an exchange or\nmarket, an investor may be unable to purchase\nor sell Fund shares. In addition, if trading\nin certain securities or financial instruments\nis restricted, this may disrupt a Fund\u2019s\ncreation/redemption process, affect the price\nat which Fund shares trade in the secondary\nmarket, and result in a Fund being unable to\ntrade certain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such circumstances, a Fund may\nbe unable to rebalance its portfolio or\naccurately price its portfolio holdings and\nmay incur substantial trading losses. Shares\nof a Fund, similar to shares of other issuers\nlisted on a stock exchange, may be sold short\nand are therefore subject to the risk of\nincreased volatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short. In addition,\ntrading activity in derivative products based\non a Fund may lead to increased trading volume\nand volatility in the secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares May Trade at\nPrices Other Than NAV . Shares of a Fund trade\non stock exchanges at prices at, above or\nbelow the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. A Fund\u2019s NAV\nis calculated at the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in the market\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings. The\ntrading price of a Fund\u2019s shares fluctuates\nthroughout trading hours based on both market\nsupply of and demand for Fund shares and the\nunderlying value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the trading\nprices of a Fund\u2019s shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant redemption requests,\nor other unusual market conditions However,\nbecause Fund shares can be created and\nredeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or premiums to a\nFund\u2019s NAV are not likely to be sustained over\nthe long term (unlike shares of many closed-\nend funds, which frequently trade at\nappreciable discounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While the\ncreation/redemption feature is designed to\nmake it more likely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock exchanges at\nprices close to the Fund\u2019s next calculated\nNAV, exchange prices are not expected to\ncorrelate exactly with the Fund\u2019s NAV due to\ntiming reasons, supply and demand imbalances\nand other factors. In addition, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers, Authorized\nParticipants, or other market participants,\nand during periods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading prices for\nshares of a Fund that differ significantly\nfrom its NAV. Authorized Participants 10 may\nbe less willing to create or redeem a Fund\u2019s\nshares if there is a lack of an active market\nfor such shares or the Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments, which may contribute to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or Selling Fund\nShares. Buying or selling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of costs that\napply to all securities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you will likely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is\nthe difference between what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares (the \u201c bid \u201d\nprice) and the price at which they are willing\nto sell Fund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price). The\nspread varies over time for Fund shares based\non trading volume and market liquidity. It is\ngenerally narrower if a Fund has more trading\nvolume and market liquidity and wider if a\nFund has less trading volume and market\nliquidity. Increased market volatility also\nmay cause wider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other charges that are\nincurred as a result of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in buying or\nselling Fund shares, frequent trading may\ndetract significantly from investment results,\nand an investment in Fund shares may not be\nadvisable for investors who anticipate\nregularly making small investments through a\nbrokerage account. Materials Companies Risk.\nThe materials sector tends to be closely tied\nto the economic cycle and can be significantly\naffected by supply-demand dynamics. Materials\ncompanies may be adversely affected by\ncommodity price volatility, exchange rate\nfluctuations, social and political unrest,\nwar, import and export controls, supply chain\ndisruption, increased competition, depletion\nof resources, technical advances, labor\nrelations, litigation and government\nregulations, among other factors. Materials\ncompanies are at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may incur significant costs in\ncomplying with environmental laws. Mid-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Investments in\nmid-capitalization companies may be riskier,\nless liquid, more volatile and more\nsusceptible to economic, market and industry\nchanges than investments in large-\ncapitalization companies. Mid-capitalization\ncompanies may have more limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources and management\nexperience. As a result, they generally are\nmore vulnerable than large-capitalization\ncompanies to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Mid-capitalization companies may\nhave a shorter business track record, with\nrelatively less information available to\ninvestors. The securities of mid-sized\ncompanies may trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than the securities of larger\ncompanies. Momentum Securities Risk.\nSecurities that previously exhibited greater\nmomentum characteristics than other securities\nmay not continue to experience positive\nmomentum, and such a change could occur\nquickly. Momentum securities may experience\nmore volatility than the market as a whole,\nand their returns may be less than the returns\nof other styles of investing or the overall\nstock market. A Fund that invests in momentum\nsecurities may experience significant losses\nif momentum stops, reverses or otherwise\nbehaves differently than predicted. In\naddition, there may be periods when the\nmomentum style of investing is out of favor,\nand the investment performance of a Fund may\nsuffer during such period. Operational Risk.\nEach Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. Each Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Quality\nSecurities Risk. Securities that previously\nexhibited greater quality characteristics than\nother securities may not continue to be\nquality securities. Many factors can impact a\nsecurity\u2019s quality and performance, and such\nfactors and their impact may be difficult to\npredict. The returns of quality securities may\nbe less than the returns of other styles of\ninvesting or the overall stock market. In\naddition, there may be periods when the\nquality style of investing is out of favor,\nand the investment performance of a Fund may\nsuffer during such period. Real Estate\nCompanies Risk. Real estate companies, which\ninclude real estate investment trusts, real\nestate holding and operating companies, and\nreal estate management or development\ncompanies, expose investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly as well as to the\nrisks from the way that such companies\noperate. Real estate companies and property\nvalues may be adversely affected by\nregulations and other governmental actions,\nincluding tax increases, zoning changes and\nother usage restrictions, environmental\nregulations, regulatory limitations on rent or\neviction, and eminent domain. Real estate is\nhighly sensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and can be subject to intense\ncompetition and periodic overbuilding. Real\nestate companies may own a limited number of\nproperties and concentrate their investments\nin a particular geographic region, industry or\nproperty type. Economic downturns or other\nadverse events ( e.g. , natural disasters)\nthat affect a particular region, industry or\nproperty type may lead to decreases in\nproperty values, leasing declines and defaults\nby borrowers or tenants. In the event of a\ndefault, a real estate company may experience\nsubstantial delays and costs in enforcing its\nrights with respect to the property and\nprotecting its investment. In addition,\nbecause real estate is relatively illiquid, a\ncompany may be constrained in its ability to\ndiversify or liquidate its investments in\nresponse to economic conditions or other\nevents. Real estate companies may depend on\nthe management skills of a few key individuals\nand may have limited financial resources. They\nmay be highly leveraged, which can magnify\nlosses, and interest rate increases can make\nit difficult for them, as well as borrowers\nand tenants, to obtain debt financing and meet\npayment obligations. Declining interest rates\ncould result in increased prepayment on loans\nand require redeployment of capital in less\ndesirable investments. Certain real estate\ncompanies, such as REITs, could fail to\nqualify for favorable tax or regulatory\ntreatment, which could produce adverse\neconomic consequences for the company and its\ninvestors, including a Fund. 11 Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S. Investing in U.S.\nissuers involves legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic risks that\nare specific to the U.S. A decrease in imports\nor exports, changes in trade regulations,\ninflation, an economic recession, financial\nsystem stress, or political turmoil, among\nother risks, may have an adverse effect on the\nU.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges. The U.S. is also subject to the\nrisk of natural disasters, such as droughts,\nearthquakes, fires and floods. U.S. security\nrisks include acts of terrorism, internal\nunrest and a deterioration in relations\nbetween the U.S. and certain countries. Any of\nthese may adversely affect the U.S. economy,\nfinancial markets or issuers. Governmental\nagencies project that the U.S. will maintain\nelevated public debt levels for the\nforeseeable future. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily indicate or cause\neconomic problems, the costs of servicing such\ndebt may constrain future economic growth.\nCircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal on\nU.S. government debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. Securities Lending\nRisk. A Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that a\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. A\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for a Fund. Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Investments in\nsmall-capitalization companies may be riskier,\nless liquid, more volatile and more\nsusceptible to economic, market and industry\nchanges than investments in large- or mid-\ncapitalization companies. Small-capitalization\ncompanies may have more limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, personnel and\nmanagement experience. As a result, they\ngenerally are more vulnerable than larger\ncompanies to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Small-capitalization companies\nmay have a short business track record, with\nrelatively less information available to\ninvestors. The securities of smaller companies\nmay trade less frequently and in lower volumes\nthan the securities of larger companies. Some\nsecurities of smaller issuers may be illiquid\nor restricted as to resale, and their values\nmay have significant volatility. A Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such\nsecurities at any time, or at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet the Fund\u2019s\nobligations. Small Fund Risk. When a Fund\u2019s\nsize is small, the Fund may experience low\ntrading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In\naddition, a Fund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if it does not meet certain\nrequirements set by the listing exchange. If a\nFund were required to delist from the listing\nexchange, the Fund\u2019s value may rapidly decline\nand its performance may be negatively\nimpacted. Any resulting liquidation of the\nFund could lead to elevated transaction costs\nfor the Fund and negative tax consequences for\nits shareholders. Style Factors Risk. The\napplicable style factors for a Fund based on\nits Underlying Index have characteristics that\nmay cause the Fund to underperform the\napplicable Parent Index or the market as a\nwhole. There may be periods when a particular\nstyle of equity investing is out of favor, and\nthe investment performance of a Fund may\nsuffer during such a period. Momentum Factor\nRisk . Securities that previously exhibited\ngreater momentum characteristics than other\nsecurities may not continue to experience\npositive momentum, and such a change could\noccur quickly. Momentum securities may\nexperience more volatility than the market as\na whole. Quality Factor Risk . Securities that\npreviously exhibited greater quality\ncharacteristics than other securities may not\ncontinue to be quality securities. Many\nfactors can impact a security\u2019s quality and\nperformance, and such factors and their impact\nmay be difficult to predict. Value Factor Risk\n. Value securities may decline in price or\nfail to appreciate for long periods of time,\nand they may never realize their full\npotential value. Although value securities\nhave generally performed better than non-value\nsecurities during periods of economic\nrecovery, there is no assurance that they will\ncontinue to do so. Low Volatility Factor Risk\n. Low volatility securities may underperform\nthe broader market during periods of strong,\nrising or speculative stock prices. The prices\nof such securities may not be any less\nvolatile (and could be more volatile) than the\nmarket as a whole. Low Size Factor Risk . Low\nsize companies may have more limited product\nlines, markets, financial resources, personnel\nand management experience and thus may be more\nvulnerable to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments than relatively larger-\ncapitalized companies. Low size securities may\nbe more be more volatile and less liquid than\nsecurities on the larger end of a Fund\u2019s\ncapitalization range, and it may be more\ndifficult for a Fund to buy and sell them.\nTechnology Companies Risk. Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources\nand personnel. These companies may face rapid\nproduct obsolescence as well as unexpected\nrisks and costs related to new product\nintroduction and technological developments,\nsuch as artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning. Technology companies may be\nadversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs.\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk. If certain\naggregate and/or fund-level ownership\nthresholds are reached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates or a Fund,\nor as a result of third-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or regulator, the ability\nof BFA and 12 its affiliates on behalf of\nclients (including a Fund) to purchase or\ndispose of investments, exercise rights or\nundertake business transactions may be\nrestricted by regulation or otherwise\nimpaired. The capacity of a Fund to invest in\ncertain securities or other assets may be\naffected by the relevant threshold limits, and\nsuch limitations may have adverse effects on\nthe liquidity and performance of a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. To the extent a Fund\ntracks an index, such limits may increase the\nrisk of the Fund being underinvested in an\nasset relative to its Underlying Index and\nincrease the risk of tracking error. For\nexample, ownership limits may apply to\nsecurities whose issuers operate in certain\nregulated industries or in certain\ninternational markets. Such limits also may\napply where the investing entity (such as a\nFund) is subject to corporate or regulatory\nownership restrictions or invests in certain\nfutures or other derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel amounts invested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including a Fund) may not\nexceed the relevant limits without the grant\nof a license or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent. In other cases, exceeding such\nthresholds may cause BFA and its affiliates, a\nFund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions.\nTracking Error Risk. A Fund that tracks an\nindex is subject to the risk of \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of a Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by a Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; a Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by a Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for a Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index, such\nas during a rebalancing or reconstitution; and\nimpacts to a Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. A Fund that\ntracks an index composed of a large number of\nsecurities or other assets may experience\ngreater tracking error than a Fund that tracks\na more narrow index. Tracking error risk may\nbe heightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nUtility Companies Risk. Utility infrastructure\noften requires significant capital\nexpenditures, and utility companies may face\nhigh interest costs and difficulty in raising\ncapital. Technological innovations may render\nexisting equipment or products obsolete, and\ncompanies may experience difficulty in\nobtaining regulatory approval of new\ntechnologies. Utility operations may be\ndisrupted by events that target or damage\nutility infrastructure, including natural\ndisasters and cyber or other attacks.\nUtilities companies may be adversely affected\nby volatility in the price of certain energy\nresources. Utility companies face risks from\ngovernment regulation and oversight as well as\nfrom deregulation (if applicable). Regulators\nmay monitor and control companies\u2019 revenues\nand costs. There is no assurance that\nregulators will grant rate increases or that\nrate levels will be adequate to permit the\npayment of stock dividends or bond coupon\npayments. In addition, there may be regulatory\nrestrictions on the ability of utility\ncompanies to enter new lines of business and\ngeographic areas. Utility companies incur\ncosts in complying with environmental and\nother regulations and may face significant\nchallenges in obtaining regulatory approval\nfor certain projects, such as nuclear power\nplants. Utility companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. Energy conservation, climate\nchange and other sustainability policies also\nmay impact utility companies. Deregulation may\nsubject companies to greater competition, may\nadversely affect their profitability and may\nlead them to engage in riskier ventures. Value\nSecurities Risk. Value securities are those\nissued by companies that may be perceived as\nundervalued. Such securities may decline in\nprice or fail to appreciate for long periods\nof time, and they may never realize their full\npotential value because the market fails to\nrecognize the stock\u2019s intrinsic worth. Value\nsecurities may underperform growth securities\nand other types of assets as well as the\noverall stock market. Although value\nsecurities have generally performed better\nthan non-value securities during periods of\neconomic recovery, there is no assurance that\nthey will continue to do so. Value securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of a Fund with\nsuch holdings. Portfolio Holdings Information\nA description of the policies and procedures\nwith respect to the disclosure of the Funds\u2019\nportfolio securities and other assets (as\napplicable) is available in the applicable\nStatement of Additional Information ( \u201c SAI \u201d\n). Each Fund discloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com. Fact sheets\nproviding information about each Fund\u2019s top\nholdings are posted on www.iShares.com when\navailable and may be requested by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737). Management of\nthe Funds Investment Adviser As investment\nadviser, BFA has overall responsibility for\nthe general management and administration of\nthe Funds. BFA provides an investment program\nfor the Funds and manages the investment of\nthe Funds\u2019 assets. In seeking to achieve the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment objectives, BFA\nuses teams of portfolio managers, investment\nstrategists and other investment specialists\nand may draw upon the trading, research and\nexpertise of its affiliates. This team\napproach brings together many disciplines and\nleverages BFA\u2019s extensive resources. 13\n\nBFA is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of\nBlackRock, Inc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ) and is\nlocated at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco,\nCA 94105. As of September 30, 2024, BFA and\nits affiliates provided investment advisory\nservices for assets of approximately $11.5\ntrillion. From time to time, an employee of\nBlackRock may express views regarding a\nparticular security or other instrument, asset\nclass, company, industry, or market sector.\nSuch views are the views of only that\nindividual as of the time expressed. They do\nnot necessarily represent the views of\nBlackRock or any other person within the\nBlackRock organization. Such views may change\nat any time based upon market or other\nconditions, and BlackRock has no\nresponsibility to update such views. You\nshould not rely on any such views as\ninvestment advice or as an indication of\ntrading intent on behalf of a Fund. Fees and\nExpenses Pursuant to the Investment Advisory\nAgreement between BFA and the Trust (entered\ninto on behalf of the Funds), BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\neach Fund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses and any\nextraordinary expenses (as determined by a\nmajority of the Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the Trust). Operating\nexpenses paid by BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude Acquired Fund Fees\nand Expenses, if any. A discussion regarding\nthe basis for the approval by the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d ) of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with BFA is\navailable in the Funds' Form N-CSR filed with\nthe SEC for the period ended July 31 and in\nthe applicable financial statements posted at\nwww.iShares.com. For its investment advisory\nservices to each Fund, for the fiscal year\nended July 31, 2024, BFA was paid a management\nfee from each Fund, as a percentage of the\nFund\u2019s average daily net assets, net of any\napplicable waivers, at the annual rate set\nforth in the table below. If BFA has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fees for a Fund, the contractual\nwaiver may be terminated prior to its\nexpiration date only upon written agreement of\nthe Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from\ntime to time voluntarily waive and/or\nreimburse fees or expenses to reduce a Fund\u2019s\ntotal annual fund operating expenses\n(excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if\nany). Any such voluntary waiver or\nreimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime.\n                                              \n  Fund                        Management Fee  \n  iShares ESG MSCI USA Min    0.18%           \n  Vol Factor ETF                              \n  iShares MSCI USA Min Vol    0.15%           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI USA Momentum   0.15%           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI USA Quality    0.15%           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI USA Size       0.15%           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI USA Small-Cap  0.20%           \n  Min Vol Factor ETF                          \n  iShares MSCI USA Value      0.15%           \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares U.S. Equity Factor  0.08%           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares U.S. Small-Cap      0.15%           \n  Equity Factor ETF                           \n                                              \nPortfolio Managers The Portfolio Managers for\neach Fund are responsible for various\nfunctions related to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to, investing cash\ninflows, coordinating with members of their\nrespective portfolio management teams to focus\non certain asset classes, implementing\ninvestment strategy, researching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and overseeing members of\ntheir respective teams who have more limited\nresponsibilities.

BFA and its Affiliates are\ninvolved worldwide with a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset management\nactivities and in the ordinary course of\nbusiness may engage in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests of other\nclients may conflict with those of a Fund. BFA\nand its Affiliates act, or may act, as an\ninvestor, research provider, investment\nmanager, commodity pool operator, commodity\ntrading advisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent\nand/or principal. BFA and its Affiliates may\nhave other direct and indirect interests in\nsecurities, currencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other assets in which a Fund\nmay directly or indirectly invest. BFA and its\nAffiliates may engage in proprietary trading\nand advise accounts and other funds that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in and compete for\ntransactions in the same or similar types of\nsecurities, currencies and other assets as are\nheld by a Fund. This may include transactions\nin securities issued by other open-end and\nclosed-end investment companies, including\ninvestment companies that are affiliated with\nthe Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). The trading\nactivities of BFA and its Affiliates are\ncarried out without reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by a Fund. These\nactivities may result in BFA or an Affiliate\nhaving positions in assets that are senior or\njunior to, or that have interests different\nfrom or adverse to, the assets held by a Fund.\nA Fund may invest in securities issued by, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nwith which an Affiliate has significant debt\nor equity investments or other interests. A\nFund may also invest in issuances (such as\ndebt offerings or structured notes) for which\nan Affiliate is compensated for providing\nadvisory, cash management or other services. A\nFund also may invest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nfor which an Affiliate provides or may provide\nresearch coverage or other analysis. An\nAffiliate may have business relationships\nwith, and receive compensation from,\ndistributors, consultants or others who\nrecommend a Fund or who engage in transactions\nwith or for a Fund. Neither BlackRock nor any\nAffiliate is under any obligation to share any\ninvestment opportunity, idea or strategy with\na Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete\nwith a Fund for appropriate investment\nopportunities. The results of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of other\naccounts managed by an Affiliate. It is\npossible that a Fund could sustain losses\nduring periods in which one or more Affiliates\nand other accounts achieve profits on their\ntrading for proprietary or other accounts. The\nopposite result is also possible. In addition,\na Fund may enter into transactions in which\nBFA or an Affiliate or their directors,\nofficers, employees or clients have an adverse\ninterest. A Fund may be adversely impacted by\nthe effects of transactions undertaken by BFA\nor an Affiliate or their directors, officers,\nemployees or clients. From time to time,\nBlackRock or its advisory clients (including\nother funds and accounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, purchase and\nhold shares of a Fund. The price,\navailability, liquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by BlackRock\nor its advisory clients. A Fund\u2019s activities\nmay be limited because of regulatory\nrestrictions applicable to BFA or an Affiliate\nor their policies designed to comply with such\nrestrictions. Under a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board, the Funds have\nretained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as\ntheir securities lending agent to the extent\nthat they participate in the securities\nlending program. For these services, the\nsecurities lending agent will receive a fee\nfrom the participating Fund based on the\nreturns earned on the Fund\u2019s lending\nactivities, including investment of the cash\n\n15\n\nreceived as collateral for the loaned\nsecurities. In addition, one or more\nAffiliates may be among the entities to which\na Fund may lend its portfolio securities under\nthe securities lending program. Under an ETF\nServices Agreement, certain Funds have\nretained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an Affiliate of\nBFA, to perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d )\non the design and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may have, or from\ntime to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its Affiliates. BlackRock and its\nAffiliates may benefit from a Fund using a\nBlackRock index by creating increasing\nacceptance in the marketplace for such\nindexes. BlackRock and its Affiliates are not\nobligated to license an index to a Fund, and\nno Fund is under an obligation to use a\nBlackRock index. The terms of a Fund\u2019s index\nlicensing agreement with BlackRock or its\nAffiliates may not be as favorable as the\nterms offered to other licensees. The\nactivities of BFA and its Affiliates and their\nrespective directors, officers or employees\nmay give rise to other conflicts of interest\nthat could disadvantage a Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to address these potential\nconflicts of interest. Please see the SAI for\nfurther information. Shareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder information, including\nhow to buy and sell shares of the Funds, is\navailable free of charge by calling toll-free\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting\nwww.iShares.com. Buying and Selling Shares\nTransactions in shares of the Funds occur in\nthe primary market and the secondary market.\nPrimary market transactions, known as \u201c\ncreations \u201d and \u201c redemptions, \u201d occur only\nbetween the Funds and Authorized Participants\n( i.e ., financial institutions that are\nauthorized to participate in such\ntransactions), as described in the Creations\nand Redemptions section below. Fund shares are\nlisted on U.S. national securities exchanges,\nwhere they can be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day at market prices, like shares\nof other publicly traded companies. A Fund\u2019s\nshares may also be available in other\nsecondary markets, such as on non-U.S.\nexchanges and through funds or structured\ninvestment vehicles similar to depositary\nreceipts. The Funds do not impose any minimum\ninvestment for Fund shares purchased on an\nexchange or otherwise in the secondary market.\nBuying or selling Fund shares on an exchange\nor other secondary market generally involves\ntwo types of costs that are common in\nsecurities transactions. First, when buying or\nselling Fund shares through a broker, you may\nincur a brokerage commission and other\ncharges. The commission is frequently a fixed\namount; it may be a significant proportional\ncost if you are seeking to buy or sell small\namounts of shares. Second, you may incur the\ncost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is any\ndifference between the bid price and the ask\nprice for the shares. The spread varies over\ntime based on a Fund\u2019s trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. Generally, the spread is\nsmaller if a Fund has high trading volume and\nmarket liquidity, and larger if a Fund has\nlower trading volume and market liquidity. The\nlatter is often the case for newly launched or\nsmaller funds. A Fund\u2019s spread may also be\nimpacted by the liquidity (or lack thereof) of\nthe underlying securities or other assets held\nby the Fund, particularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds, or by instances of\nsignificant volatility of the underlying\nassets. The U.S. national securities exchanges\nthat list Fund shares are open for trading\nMonday through Friday and are closed on\nweekends and the following holidays (or the\ndays on which they are observed): New Year\u2019s\nDay, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents\u2019\nDay, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day\nand Christmas Day. Investments in Investment\nCompanies Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments by investment\ncompanies, including foreign and unregistered\ninvestment companies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For example, a\nregistered investment company (the \u201c Acquired\nFund \u201d ), such as the Funds, may not knowingly\nsell or otherwise dispose of any security\nissued by the Acquired Fund to any investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquiring Fund \u201d ) or any\ncompany or companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale\nor disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company\nor companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund,\nor (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and other investment\ncompanies and companies controlled by them.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, registered\ninvestment companies are permitted to invest\nin a Fund beyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions set forth in Rule 12d1-4 under the\n1940 Act. To make such an investment in an\nAcquired Fund, a registered investment company\nmust, among other things, enter into an\nagreement with the Trust. If an Acquired Fund\ninvests significantly in other registered\ninvestment companies in reliance on Rule\n12d1-4, an Acquiring Fund will not be\npermitted to rely on Rule 12d1-4 and invest in\nthe Fund beyond the Section 12(d)(1) limits.\nAny investment company interested in\npurchasing shares of a Fund beyond the limits\nset forth in Section 12(d)(1) should contact\nBFA. 16 Foreign investment companies are\npermitted to invest in a Fund only up to the\nlimits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject\nto any applicable SEC no-action relief. Book\nEntry Shares of the Funds are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The Depository Trust\nCompany ( \u201c DTC \u201d ), which serves as the\nsecurities depository for shares of the Funds,\nor its nominee is the record owner of, and\nholds legal title to, all outstanding shares\nof the Funds. Investors owning Fund shares are\nbeneficial owners as shown on the records of\nDTC or its participants. DTC participants\ninclude securities brokers and dealers, banks,\ntrust companies, clearing corporations and\nother institutions that directly or indirectly\nmaintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As\na beneficial owner of Fund shares, you are not\nentitled to receive physical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares registered in\nyour name, and you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares. Therefore, to\nexercise any right as an owner of Fund shares,\nyou must rely upon the procedures of DTC and\nits participants. These procedures are the\nsame as those that apply to any other\nsecurities held in book-entry or \u201c street name\n\u201d form. Share Prices The trading prices of a\nFund\u2019s shares in the secondary market\ngenerally differ from the Fund\u2019s daily NAV and\nare affected by various factors, such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF shares and the\nsecurities or other assets held by a Fund as\nwell as other market and economic conditions.\nDetermination of Net Asset Value The NAV of a\nFund normally is determined once daily Monday\nthrough Friday, on each day that the New York\nStock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) is open for\ntrading. The NAV generally is determined as of\nthe close of the NYSE\u2019s regular trading hours,\nnormally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, based on\nprices at the time of closing. Any Fund assets\nor liabilities that are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing\nmarket rates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data service providers.\nThe NAV of a Fund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s net assets ( i.e .,\nthe value of its total assets, including the\nvalue of any underlying fund shares in which\nthe Fund invests, less total liabilities) by\nthe total number of outstanding shares of the\nFund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.\nThe value of a Fund\u2019s assets and liabilities\nis determined pursuant to BFA\u2019s valuation\npolicies and procedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the valuation\ndesignee for each Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5\nunder the Investment Company Act. Equity\nsecurities and other equity instruments for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at market value, which is generally\ndetermined using the last reported official\nclosing price or, if a reported closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on the\nexchange or market on which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at the time of\nvaluation. Shares of underlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds) that are not\ntraded on an exchange are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying ETFs and closed-\nend funds that trade on exchanges are valued\nat their most recent market closing price.\nFixed-income securities are valued using last\navailable bid prices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or prices\n(including evaluated prices) supplied by the\nFunds\u2019 approved independent third-party\npricing services, each in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s valuation policies and procedures.\nPricing services may use matrix pricing or\nvaluation models that utilize certain inputs\nand assumptions to derive values. Pricing\nservices generally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly transactions of an\ninstitutional round lot size, but a Fund may\nhold or transact in such securities in smaller\nodd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower\nprices than institutional round lots. An\namortized cost method of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations with 60 days\nor less remaining to maturity unless BFA\ndetermines in good faith that such method does\nnot represent fair value. Generally, trading\nin certain instruments ( e.g ., non-U.S.\nsecurities, money market instruments, etc.) is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of the NYSE\u2019s regular\ntrading hours. The values of such instruments\nused in computing a Fund\u2019s NAV are determined\nas of such times. For certain foreign assets,\na third-party vendor supplies evaluated,\nsystematic fair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-factor model\nafter the relevant foreign markets have\nclosed. This systematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to correlate the\nprices of foreign assets in one or more\nnon-U.S. markets following the close of the\nlocal markets to the prices that might have\nprevailed as of a Fund\u2019s pricing time.\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options may\nbe valued using a mathematical model that may\nincorporate a number of market data factors.\nWhen market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in accordance with its policies\nand procedures. Fair value represents a good\nfaith approximation of the value of an asset\nor liability. It is the amount that the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive from the\ncurrent sale of an asset or the cost to\nextinguish a liability in an arm\u2019s-length\ntransaction. 17 BFA may conclude that a market\nquotation is not readily available or is\nunreliable if: \u25a0 An asset or liability does\nnot have a price source due to its lack of\ntrading or other reasons; \u25a0 A market quotation\ndiffers significantly from recent price\nquotations or otherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value; \u25a0 An asset or liability is\nthinly traded; \u25a0 There is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent market\nquotation; or \u25a0 The trading market on which an\ninstrument is listed is suspended or closed\nand no appropriate alternative trading market\nis available. A \u201c significant event \u201d is\ndeemed to occur if BFA determines, in its\nreasonable business judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u2019s assets or\nliabilities, that the event is likely to cause\na material change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nof the Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities. Valuing a\nFund\u2019s investments using fair value pricing\nmay result in prices that differ from current\nmarket valuations and that may not be the\nprices at which those investments could have\nbeen sold during the period for which the\nparticular fair values were used. For an index\nFund, the use of both fair value prices and\ncurrent market valuations in a particular NAV\ncalculation could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying index. This could, in turn, result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of its underlying index.\nDividends and Distributions General Policies.\nA Fund generally declares and pays dividends\nfrom net investment income, if any, at least\nonce a year. Distributions of net realized\nsecurities gains, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid once a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more frequent\nbasis for a Fund. The Trust reserves the right\nto declare special distributions if, in its\nreasonable discretion, such action is\nnecessary or advisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d )\nor to avoid the imposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or realized\ngains. Dividends and other distributions on\nFund shares are distributed on a pro rata\nbasis to beneficial owners of the shares.\nDividend payments and other distributions are\nmade through DTC participants and indirect\nparticipants to beneficial owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from the Funds.\nDividend Reinvestment Service. No dividend\nreinvestment service is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make the DTC book-entry\nDividend Reinvestment Program available to\nbeneficial owners of Fund shares for the\nreinvestment of distributions. Beneficial\nowners should contact their broker to\ndetermine the availability and costs of the\nservice and the details of participation.\nBrokers may require beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and timetables.\nIf the program is used, dividend distributions\nof both income and realized gains will be\nautomatically reinvested in additional whole\nFund shares purchased in the secondary market.\nNote on Tax Information. The following\nsections summarize some of the consequences\nunder current U.S. federal tax law of an\ninvestment in a Fund. This information is not\na substitute for personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and local taxation on\nFund distributions and sales of Fund shares.\nDistributions that are attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal government\nobligations may be exempt from certain state\nand local tax. Consult your personal tax\nadvisor about the potential tax consequences\nof an investment in Fund shares under all\napplicable tax laws. Taxes As with any\ninvestment, you should consider how your\ninvestment in shares of a Fund will be taxed,\nincluding possible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or when you sell Fund\nshares. The tax information in this Prospectus\nis provided as general information, based on\ncurrent law. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund. There is no\nguarantee that shares of a Fund will receive\ncertain regulatory or accounting treatment.\nTaxes on Fund Distributions Shareholders in a\nFund will receive information after the end of\neach calendar year setting forth the amount of\ndividends and long-term capital gains\ndistributed to them by the Fund during the\nprior year, if any. Likewise, the amount of\ntax-exempt income, if any, that a Fund\ndistributes will be reported. Such income must\nbe reported on the shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax return. In general, distributions\nare subject to U.S. federal income tax for the\nyear when they are paid. Certain distributions\npaid in January, however, may be treated as\npaid on December 31 of the prior year. Capital\nGains. Distributions from a Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than qualified\ndividend income or from net tax-exempt income,\nif any), including distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and distributions out\nof a Fund\u2019s net short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as ordinary income.\nDistributions by a Fund of net long-term\ncapital gains, if any, in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses (capital gain dividends)\nare taxable to you as long-term capital gains,\nregardless of how long you have held the\nFund\u2019s shares. Long-term capital gains and\nqualified dividend income are generally\neligible for taxation at preferential rates\nfor non-corporate shareholders. However,\ndifferent preferential rates may apply\ndepending on the type of capital gains, such\nas Fund distributions of certain amounts\nreceived from real estate investment trusts (\n\u201c REITs \u201d ), if any. 18 Return of Capital. If\na Fund\u2019s distributions exceed current and\naccumulated earnings and profits, all or a\nportion of the distributions made in the\ntaxable year may be recharacterized as a\nreturn of capital to shareholders. A return of\ncapital distribution generally will not be\ntaxable but will reduce the shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis and result in a higher capital gain or\nlower capital loss when those shares on which\nthe distribution was received are sold. Once a\nshareholder\u2019s cost basis is reduced to zero,\nfurther distributions will be treated as\ncapital gains, if the shareholder holds shares\nof the Fund as capital assets. Distributions\nin excess of a Fund\u2019s minimum distribution\nrequirements, but not in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be taxable to\nshareholders and will not constitute\nnontaxable returns of capital. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by a Fund that\nqualify as qualified dividend income, if any,\nare taxable to you at long-term capital gain\nrates. Dividends will be qualified dividend\nincome to you if they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income received by a Fund.\nGenerally, qualified dividend income includes\ndividend income from stock issued by taxable\nU.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S.\ncorporations, provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements and has\nnot hedged its position in the stock in\ncertain ways. For this purpose, a qualified\nnon-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S.\ncorporation that is eligible for benefits\nunder a comprehensive income tax treaty with\nthe U.S., which includes an exchange of\ninformation program, or if the stock with\nrespect to which the dividend was paid is\nreadily tradable on an established U.S.\nsecurities market. The term excludes a\ncorporation that is a passive foreign\ninvestment company. Dividends received by a\nFund from a RIC, if any, generally are\nqualified dividend income only to the extent\nthat such dividend distributions are made out\nof qualified dividend income received by such\nRIC. Additionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from a REIT, if\nany, and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a Fund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified business income\n\u201d deduction for non-corporate U.S.\nshareholders to the extent that the Fund\u2019s\nincome is derived from ordinary REIT\ndividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.\nFor a dividend to be treated as qualified\ndividend income, the dividend must be received\nwith respect to a share of stock held without\nbeing hedged by the relevant Fund, and with\nrespect to a share of the Fund held without\nbeing hedged by you, for 61 days during the\n121-day period beginning at the date that is\n60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such date. Fund\ndistributions, to the extent attributable to\ndividends from U.S. corporations, will be\neligible for the dividends received deduction\nfor Fund shareholders that are corporations,\nsubject to certain hedging and holding\nrequirements. Substitute dividends received by\na Fund with respect to dividends paid on\nsecurities lent out, if any, will not be\nqualified dividend income. Medicare Tax. A\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is\nimposed on \u201c net investment income, \u201d\nincluding, but not limited to, interest,\ndividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if\nmarried and filing jointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Alternative Minimum Tax. The AMT is a\nseparate U.S. federal tax system that operates\nin parallel to the regular federal income tax\nsystem but eliminates many deductions and\nexclusions. The AMT has different tax rates\nand treats as taxable certain types of income\nthat are nontaxable for regular income tax\npurposes, such as the interest on certain \u201c\nprivate activity \u201d municipal bonds. If a\ntaxpayer\u2019s overall AMT liability is higher\nthan regular income tax liability, then the\ntaxpayer owes the regular income tax liability\nplus the difference between the AMT liability\nand the regular income tax liability. Market\nDiscount Bonds Any market discount recognized\non a bond, including a tax-exempt interest\nbond, is taxable as ordinary income. A market\ndiscount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or adjusted issue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount. To the extent that a\nFund does not include the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gains on the Fund\u2019s\ndisposition of such an obligation will be\ntreated as ordinary income rather than capital\ngains to the extent of the accrued market\ndiscount. Derivatives and Other Complex\nInstruments A Fund may invest in derivatives\nand other complex instruments, and such\ninvestments may be subject to special and\ncomplicated rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund\nare treated as ordinary income or capital\ngains, accelerate the recognition of income to\na Fund or defer a Fund\u2019s ability to recognize\nlosses. In addition, these rules may affect\nthe amount, timing or character of income\ndistributed to you by a Fund. You should\nconsult your personal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules. Non-U.S.\nIncome Taxes Dividends, interest and capital\ngains (if any) earned by a Fund with respect\nto securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may\ngive rise to withholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If,\nat the close of a year, more than 50% of a\nFund\u2019s total assets consist of non-U.S. stocks\nor securities (generally, for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ), generally the Fund may \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to you certain non-U.S. income\ntaxes, including withholding taxes, paid by\nthe Fund. This means that you would be\nconsidered to have received as an additional\ndividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes,\nbut you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your U.S.\nfederal income tax. No 19 deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not pass through\nnon-U.S. taxes, the Fund will be entitled to\nclaim a deduction for certain foreign taxes\nthat it incurs. Under certain circumstances,\nif a Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes\npaid with respect to a prior year, the value\nof Fund shares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions passed\nthrough to shareholders with respect to the\nFund\u2019s foreign taxes for the current year\ncould be reduced. If, at the close of the\nyear, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets\nconsist of stocks or securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers, including depositary\nreceipts (no matter where traded) of non-U.S.\ncompanies, or, at the close of each quarter,\nmore than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets consist\nof shares of an Underlying Fund, the Fund may\n\u201c pass-through \u201d to you certain non-U.S.\nincome taxes (including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund or, if its assets meet these\nrequirements, the Underlying Fund. For\npurposes of foreign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of a Fund, foreign capital gains\ntaxes may not produce associated foreign\nsource income, limiting the availability of\nsuch credits for U.S. persons. Non-U.S.\nShareholders If you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S.\nentity (other than a pass-through entity to\nthe extent owned by U.S. persons), a Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term capital\ngains), if any, generally will be subject to a\n30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a\nlower treaty rate applies. However,\nwithholding tax generally will not apply to\nany gain or income realized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder with respect to any distribution\nof long-term capital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of Fund shares. Separately,\na 30% withholding tax may be imposed on Fund\ndistributions (if any) paid to certain foreign\nentities, unless such entities comply, or are\ndeemed compliant, with extensive reporting and\nwithholding requirements designed to inform\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury of\nU.S.-owned foreign investment accounts. Backup\nWithholding If you are a resident or a citizen\nof the U.S. and you have not provided a\ntaxpayer identification number or social\nsecurity number and made other required\ncertifications, by law, backup withholding at\na 24% rate will apply to Fund distributions\nand proceeds (if any). Securities Lending If\nyour shares of a Fund are loaned out pursuant\nto a securities lending arrangement, you may\nlose the ability to treat Fund dividends that\nare paid while the shares are held by the\nborrower as qualified dividend income, and you\nmay lose the ability to use non-U.S. tax\ncredits passed through by the Fund. Fund of\nFunds If a Fund invests in an Underlying Fund,\nshort-term capital gains earned by the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will be ordinary\nincome when distributed to the Fund and will\nnot be offset by the Fund\u2019s capital losses. To\nthe extent such Fund is expected to invest in\nan Underlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s realized losses\non sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may\nbe indefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c\nwash sales. \u201d Capital loss carryforwards of\nthe Underlying Fund, if any, will not offset\nnet capital gains of the Fund. Taxes on the\nSale of Exchange-Listed Fund Shares Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund shares is generally treated as a long-\nterm capital gain or loss if the shares have\nbeen held for more than one year. Any capital\ngain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund\nshares that have been held for one year or\nless is generally treated as a short-term\ncapital gain or loss. However, any capital\nloss on a sale of Fund shares held for six\nmonths or less is treated as a long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to such\nshares. Any such capital gains, including from\nsales of Fund shares or from capital gain\ndividends, are included in \u201c net investment\nincome \u201d for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal\nMedicare contribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions Prior to being\ntraded in the secondary market, Fund shares\nare \u201c created \u201d at NAV by Authorized\nParticipants ( i.e. , market makers, large\ninvestors and other financial institutions) in\nblock-size Creation Units or multiples\nthereof. Fund shares are created or redeemed\nonly in Creation Units, and only Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem Creation\nUnits with the Funds. Each Authorized\nParticipant is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC and\nhas entered into a written agreement with the\nFunds\u2019 Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. The\nagreement allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. Authorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units for their own\naccounts or for customers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of the Funds. Creation\ntransactions are subject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the relevant Fund. Generally,\nthere are three transaction methods for\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares: in-kind\nsecurities ( \u201c in-kind \u201d ), partial cash and\nall cash. 20\n\nIn-Kind . In a creation transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits into a Fund a\n\u201c creation basket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets designated by the\nFund, as well as a cash amount. The Authorized\nParticipant receives a specified number of\nCreation Units in return. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits Creation Units with a Fund and\nreceives from the Fund a \u201c redemption basket,\n\u201d which is a portfolio of securities or other\nassets designated by the Fund, as well as a\ncash amount. Partial Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund a creation basket and a\ncash amount, including cash that replaces a\nsecurity or other asset in the creation\nbasket, in exchange for Creation Units. In a\nredemption transaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation Units with a\nFund and receives from the Fund a redemption\nbasket and a cash amount, including cash that\nreplaces a security or other asset in the\nredemption basket. All Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund an amount of cash\nspecified by the Fund in exchange for Creation\nUnits. In a redemption transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits Creation Units\nwith a Fund and receives from the Fund a\nspecified amount of cash. The creation and\nredemption baskets for a Fund may differ in\ncomposition, and certain iShares ETFs accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d More information about\ncustom baskets is provided in the Funds\u2019 SAI.\nEach Fund generally engages in creation and\nredemption transactions according to the\nmethod indicated in the table below. In\ncertain circumstances, however, a Fund may use\nanother transaction method ( e.g. , an in-kind\nFund may transact partially or fully in cash).\n                                              \n  Fund        In-Kind  Partial      All Cash  \n                       Cash                   \n  iShares                                     \n  ESG MSCI                                    \n  USA Min     \u2713                               \n  Vol Factor                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  MSCI USA    \u2713                               \n  Min Vol                                     \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  MSCI USA    \u2713                               \n  Momentum                                    \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  MSCI USA    \u2713                               \n  Quality                                     \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  MSCI USA    \u2713                               \n  Size                                        \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  MSCI USA                                    \n  Small-Cap   \u2713                               \n  Min Vol                                     \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  MSCI USA    \u2713                               \n  Value                                       \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.        \u2713                               \n  Equity                                      \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Small-Cap   \u2713                               \n  Equity                                      \n  Factor ETF                                  \n                                              \nThe prices at which creations and redemptions\noccur are based on the next calculation of a\nFund\u2019s NAV after a creation or redemption\norder is tendered in an acceptable form under\nthe Authorized Participant agreement. In the\nevent of a system failure or other\ninterruption, including disruptions at market\nmakers or Authorized Participants, creation\nand redemption orders may not be executed\naccording to a Fund\u2019s instructions or may not\nbe executed at all. Additional information\nabout the creation and redemption of Creation\nUnits (including the cut-off times for the\nreceipt of creation and redemption orders) is\nincluded in the Funds\u2019 SAI. The Funds do not\nimpose restrictions on the frequency of\npurchases and redemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with a Fund. The Board determined not\nto adopt policies and procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares because each Fund\ngenerally sells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions that are in-kind\nand/or for cash, with a deadline for placing\ncash-related transactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities. However, the Funds have\ntaken certain measures ( e.g. , imposing\ntransaction fees on purchases and redemptions\nof Creation Units and reserving the right to\nreject purchases of Creation Units under\ncertain circumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of frequent cash\npurchases and redemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased tracking\nerror, disruption of portfolio management,\ndilution to the Funds, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the vast majority\nof trading in Fund shares occurs on the\nsecondary market, which does not involve the\nFunds directly, and such trading is unlikely\nto cause many of the harmful effects of\nfrequent cash purchases or redemptions of Fund\nshares. To the extent a Fund engages in in-\nkind transactions, the Fund intends to comply\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws in\naccepting securities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with redemption\nsecurities by, among other means, assuring\nthat any securities accepted for deposit and\nany securities used to satisfy redemption\nrequests will be sold in transactions that\nwould be exempt from registration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201c 1933\nAct \u201d ). Further, an Authorized Participant\nthat is not a \u201c qualified institutional buyer,\n\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 144A under\nthe 1933 Act, will not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. Because Fund shares may be\ncreated and issued on an ongoing basis, at any\npoint during the life of a Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is used in the\n1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nthat could render them statutory underwriters\nsubject to the prospectus delivery and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nmust take into account all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each particular case.\n\n21\n\nBroker-dealers should also note that dealers\nwho are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution (as contrasted\nto ordinary secondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part of an \u201c\nunsold allotment \u201d within the meaning of\nSection 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be\nunable to take advantage of the prospectus\ndelivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3)\nof the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses\nto exchange members, the prospectus delivery\nmechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\na national securities exchange. Householding\nHouseholding is an option available to certain\nFund investors. Householding is a method of\ndelivery, based on the preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a single copy of\ncertain shareholder documents can be delivered\nto investors who share the same address, even\nif their accounts are registered under\ndifferent names. Please contact your broker-\ndealer if you are interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a single copy of\nprospectuses and other shareholder documents,\nor if you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change your\nhouseholding status. Distribution The\nDistributor or its agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the Funds on an agency basis. The\nDistributor does not maintain a secondary\nmarket in shares of the Funds. The Distributor\nhas no role in determining the policies of the\nFunds or the securities or other assets (as\napplicable) that are purchased or sold by the\nFunds. The Distributor\u2019s principal address is\n50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. BFA or\nits affiliates make payments to broker-\ndealers, registered investment advisers, banks\nor other intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, data provision services, or\ntheir making shares of the Funds available to\ntheir customers generally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such payments, which may\nbe significant to the intermediary, are not\nmade by the Funds. Rather, such payments are\nmade by BFA or its affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or indirectly\nin part from fees paid by the Funds. Payments\nof this type are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions about which\ninvestment options it recommends or makes\navailable, or the level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the payments or\nother financial incentives the intermediary is\neligible to receive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives that are offered\nor made to an intermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary and its\ncustomers and may cause the intermediary to\nrecommend the Funds over another investment.\nMore information regarding these payments is\ncontained in the applicable SAI. Please\ncontact your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional for more information regarding\nany such payments that their firm may receive\nfrom BFA or its affiliates. Financial\nHighlights The financial highlights table for\neach Fund is intended to help you understand\nthe Fund\u2019s financial performance for the past\nfive fiscal years or, if shorter, the period\nsince the Fund\u2019s inception.

345\ninvestment series or portfolios. The Trust was\norganized as a Delaware statutory trust on\nDecember 16, 1999 and is authorized to have\nmultiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 Act.\nThe offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ). This SAI\nrelates to the following Funds: \u2022 iShares\nChina Large-Cap ETF \u2022 iShares ESG MSCI USA Min\nVol Factor ETF \u2022 iShares International Equity\nFactor ETF \u2022 iShares International Small-Cap\nEquity Factor ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI EAFE ETF \u2022\niShares MSCI EAFE Growth ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI\nEAFE Min Vol Factor ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI EAFE\nSmall-Cap ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF \u2022\niShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF \u2022 iShares\nMSCI Europe Small-Cap ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI Intl\nMomentum Factor ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI Intl\nQuality Factor ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI Intl Value\nFactor ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor\nETF \u2022 iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF \u2022\niShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF \u2022 iShares\nMSCI USA Size Factor ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI USA\nSmall-Cap Min Vol Factor ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI\nUSA Value Factor ETF \u2022 iShares U.S. Equity\nFactor ETF \u2022 iShares U.S. Small-Cap Equity\nFactor ETF \u2022 iShares U.S. Tech Breakthrough\nMultisector ETF Each Fund is managed by\nBlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ), an\nindirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc., and generally seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the specific benchmark\nindex identified in the applicable Prospectus\nfor that Fund (each, an \u201c Underlying Index \u201d\n). Each Fund offers and issues shares at their\nnet asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares\n(each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ), generally in\nexchange for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other positions\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) included in its\nUnderlying Index (the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d\nor \u201c Creation Basket \u201d ), together with the\ndeposit of a specified cash payment (the \u201c\nCash Component \u201d ). Shares of the Funds are\nlisted for trading on national securities\nexchanges (a \u201c Listing Exchange \u201d ) such as\nCboe BZX Exchange, Inc. ( \u201c Cboe BZX \u201d ), The\nNasdaq Stock Market LLC ( \u201c Nasdaq \u201d ) or NYSE\nArca, Inc. ( \u201c NYSE Arca \u201d ). Shares of each\nFund are traded in the secondary market and\nelsewhere at market prices that may be at,\nabove or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are\nredeemable only in Creation Units by\nAuthorized Participants (as defined in the\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role\nof the Authorized Participant section of this\nSAI) and, generally, in exchange for portfolio\nsecurities and a Cash Amount (as defined\n\n1\n\nin the Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI). Creation Units typically are a\nspecified number of shares, generally ranging\nfrom 50,000 to 600,000 or multiples thereof.\nThe Trust reserves the right to permit or\nrequire that creations and redemptions of\nshares are effected fully or partially in cash\nand reserves the right to permit or require\nthe substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu\nof cash. Shares may be issued in advance of\nreceipt of Deposit Securities, subject to\nvarious conditions, including a requirement\nthat the Authorized Participant maintain with\nthe Trust collateral as set forth in the\nHandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\npurchase Deposit Securities. See the Creation\nand Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI. Transaction fees and other costs\nassociated with creations or redemptions that\ninclude a cash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin each Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of each Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe applicable Prospectus. Shares of each Fund\nare listed for trading, and trade throughout\nthe day, on the applicable Listing Exchange\nand in other secondary markets. Shares of\ncertain Funds may also be listed on certain\nnon-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance\nthat the requirements of the Listing Exchange\nnecessary to maintain the listing of shares of\nany Fund will continue to be met. The Listing\nExchange may, but is not required to, remove\nthe shares of a Fund from listing if, among\nother things: (i) following the initial\n12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no\nlonger eligible to operate in reliance on Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act; (iii)\nany of the other listing requirements are not\ncontinuously maintained; or (iv) any event\nshall occur or condition shall exist that, in\nthe opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes\nfurther dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of a Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of a Fund through\na broker, you may incur a brokerage commission\ndetermined by that broker, as well as other\ncharges. The Trust reserves the right to\nadjust the share price of the Funds in the\nfuture to maintain convenient trading ranges\nfor investors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Funds or an investor's\nequity interest in the Funds. Investment\nStrategies and Risks Each Fund seeks to\nachieve its objective by investing primarily\nin securities issued by issuers that compose\nits relevant Underlying Index and in\ninvestments that provide substantially similar\nexposure to securities in the Underlying\nIndex. Each Fund operates as an index fund and\nis not actively managed. Adverse performance\nof a security in a Fund\u2019s portfolio will\nordinarily not result in the elimination of\nthe security from the Fund\u2019s portfolio. Each\nFund engages in representative sampling, which\nis investing in a sample of securities\nselected by BFA to have a collective\ninvestment profile similar to that of the\nFund's Underlying Index. Securities selected\nhave aggregate investment characteristics\n(based on market capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability, earnings valuation and\nyield) and liquidity measures similar to those\nof the Fund\u2019s Underlying Index. A fund that\nuses representative sampling generally does\nnot hold all of the securities that are in its\nunderlying index. Although the Funds do not\nseek leveraged returns, certain instruments\nused by the Funds may have a leveraging effect\nas described below. Borrowing. Each Fund may\nborrow for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions.\n\n2\n\nThe purchase of securities while borrowings\nare outstanding may have the effect of\nleveraging a Fund. The incurrence of leverage\nincreases a Fund\u2019s exposure to risk, and\nborrowed funds are subject to interest costs\nthat will reduce net income. Purchasing\nsecurities while borrowings are outstanding\ncreates special risks, such as the potential\nfor greater volatility in the NAV of Fund\nshares and in the yield on a Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nIn addition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\na Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the amount\navailable (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\na Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank\nor may result in a Fund being subject to\ncovenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire a Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Currency\nTransactions. A currency forward contract is\nan over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) obligation to\npurchase or sell a specific currency at a\nfuture date, which may be any fixed number of\ndays greater than two days from the date on\nwhich the contract is agreed upon by the\nparties, at a price set at the time of the\ncontract. A non-deliverable currency forward\nis an OTC currency forward settled in a\nspecified currency, on a specified date, based\non the difference between the agreed-upon\nexchange rate and the market exchange rate. A\ncurrency futures contract is a contract that\ntrades on an organized futures exchange\ninvolving an obligation to deliver or acquire\na specified amount of a specific currency, at\na specified price and at a specified future\ntime. Currency futures contracts may be\nsettled on a net cash payment basis rather\nthan by the sale and delivery of the\nunderlying currency. Each Fund does not engage\nin currency transactions for the purpose of\nhedging against declines in the value of each\nFund's assets that are denominated in a\nnon-U.S. currency. A Fund may enter into\nnon-U.S. currency forward and non-U.S.\ncurrency futures transactions to facilitate\nlocal securities settlements or to protect\nagainst currency exposure in connection with\nits distributions to shareholders, but may not\nenter into such contracts for speculative\npurposes. Foreign exchange transactions\ninvolve a significant degree of risk and the\nmarkets in which foreign exchange transactions\nare effected may be highly volatile, highly\nspecialized and highly technical. Significant\nchanges, including changes in liquidity and\nprices, can occur in such markets within very\nshort periods of time, often within minutes.\nForeign exchange trading risks include, but\nare not limited to, exchange rate risk,\ncounterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate\nrisk, and potential interference by foreign\ngovernments through regulation of local\nexchange markets, foreign investment or\nparticular transactions in non-U.S. currency.\nIf BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions\nat an inappropriate time or judges market\nconditions, trends or correlations\nincorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may\nnot serve their intended purpose of improving\nthe correlation of a Fund's return with the\nperformance of its Underlying Index and may\nlower the Fund\u2019s return. A Fund could\nexperience losses if the value of its currency\nforwards, options or futures positions were\npoorly correlated with its other investments\nor if it could not close out its positions\nbecause of an illiquid market or otherwise. In\naddition, a Fund could incur transaction\ncosts, including trading commissions, in\nconnection with certain non-U.S. currency\ntransactions. Diversification Status.

Under the 1940 Act,\na fund cannot change its classification from\ndiversified to non-diversified without\nshareholder approval. A \u201c non-diversified \u201d\nfund is a fund that is not limited by the 1940\nAct with regard to the percentage of its\nassets that may be invested in the securities\nof a single issuer. The securities of a\nparticular issuer (or securities of issuers in\nparticular industries) may constitute a\nsignificant percentage of the underlying index\nof such a fund and, consequently, the fund\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio. This may adversely\naffect a fund\u2019s performance or subject the\nfund\u2019s shares to greater price volatility than\nthat experienced by more diversified\ninvestment companies. Each Fund (whether\ndiversified or non-diversified) intends to\nmaintain the required level of diversification\nand otherwise conduct its operations so as to\nqualify as a regulated investment company ( \u201c\nRIC \u201d ) for purposes of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c\nInternal Revenue Code \u201d ), and to relieve the\nFund of any liability for U.S. federal income\ntax to the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to shareholders, provided that the\nFund satisfies a minimum distribution\nrequirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Funds and may make it less\nlikely that the Funds will meet their\nrespective investment objectives. Futures,\nOptions on Futures and Securities Options.\nFutures contracts, options on futures and\nsecurities options may be used by a Fund to\nsimulate investment in its Underlying Index,\nto facilitate trading or to reduce transaction\ncosts. Each Fund may enter into futures\ncontracts and options on futures that are\ntraded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange.\nEach Fund will not use futures, options on\nfutures or securities options for speculative\npurposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and\noptions on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5\nof the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under the\nCommodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA, with\nrespect to certain Funds, has claimed an\nexclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d in accordance with\nRule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such\nFunds, is not subject to registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under\nthe CEA. See the Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives section of this SAI for more\ninformation. Futures contracts provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. Each\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, a Fund will\nbe required to deposit with the broker an\namount of cash or cash equivalents known as \u201c\ninitial margin, \u201d which is similar to a\nperformance bond or good faith\n\n4\n\ndeposit on the contract and is returned to the\nFund upon termination of the futures contract\nif all contractual obligations have been\nsatisfied. Subsequent payments, known as \u201c\nvariation margin, \u201d will be made to and from\nthe broker daily as the price of the\ninstrument or index underlying the futures\ncontract fluctuates, making the long and short\npositions in the futures contract more or less\nvaluable, a process known as \u201c marking-to-\nmarket. \u201d At any time prior to the expiration\nof a futures contract, each Fund may elect to\nclose the position by taking an opposite\nposition, which will operate to terminate the\nFund\u2019s existing position in the contract. An\noption on a futures contract, as contrasted\nwith a direct investment in such a contract,\ngives the purchaser the right, but no\nobligation, in return for the premium paid, to\nassume a position in the underlying futures\ncontract at a specified exercise price at any\ntime prior to the expiration date of the\noption. Upon exercise of an option, the\ndelivery of the futures position by the writer\nof the option to the holder of the option will\nbe accompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof each Fund. The potential for loss related\nto writing call options is unlimited. The\npotential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. Certain of the Funds may purchase and\nwrite put and call options on futures\ncontracts that are traded on an exchange as a\nhedge against changes in value of their\nportfolio securities or in anticipation of the\npurchase of securities, and may enter into\nclosing transactions with respect to such\noptions to terminate existing positions. There\nis no guarantee that such closing transactions\ncan be effected. Securities options may be\nused by a Fund to obtain access to securities\nin its Underlying Index or to dispose of\nsecurities in its Underlying Index at\nfavorable prices, to invest cash in a\nsecurities index that offers similar exposure\nto that provided by its Underlying Index or\notherwise to achieve the Fund\u2019s objective of\ntracking its Underlying Index. A call option\ngives a holder the right to purchase a\nspecific security at a specified price ( \u201c\nexercise price \u201d ) within a specified period\nof time. A put option gives a holder the right\nto sell a specific security at an exercise\nprice within a specified period of time. The\ninitial purchaser of a call option pays the \u201c\nwriter \u201d a premium, which is paid at the time\nof purchase and is retained by the writer\nwhether or not such option is exercised. Each\nFund may purchase put options to hedge its\nportfolio against the risk of a decline in the\nmarket value of securities held and may\npurchase call options to hedge against an\nincrease in the price of securities it is\ncommitted to purchase. Each Fund may write put\nand call options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell\nsecurities options on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nsecurities exchange or in the OTC market\nthrough a transaction with a dealer. Options\non a securities index are typically settled on\na net basis based on the appreciation or\ndepreciation of the index level over the\nstrike price. Options on single name\nsecurities may be cash- or physically-settled,\ndepending upon the market in which they are\ntraded. Options may be structured so as to be\nexercisable only on certain dates or on a\ndaily basis. Options may also be structured to\nhave conditions to exercise ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-\nin Events \u201d ) or conditions that trigger\ntermination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out Events \u201d ).\nLending Portfolio Securities. Each Fund may\nlend portfolio securities to certain borrowers\nthat BFA determines to be creditworthy,\nincluding borrowers affiliated with BFA. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is\nmaintained in an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent market value of the securities loaned.\nNo securities loan shall be made on behalf of\na Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of\nall securities loans of the particular Fund\nexceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's\ntotal assets (including the value of the\ncollateral received). A Fund may terminate a\nloan at any time and obtain the return of the\nsecurities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way\nof substitute payment, the value of any\ninterest or cash or non-cash distributions\npaid on the loaned securities that it would\nhave otherwise received if the securities were\nnot on loan. With respect to loans that are\ncollateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount\nof cash collateral. The Funds are compensated\nby any positive difference between the amount\nearned on the reinvestment of cash collateral\nand the fee paid to the borrower. In the case\nof collateral other than cash, a Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of each Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\n\n5\n\nEach Fund conducts its securities lending\npursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC\npermitting it to lend portfolio securities to\nborrowers affiliated with the Fund and to\nretain an affiliate of the Fund to act as\nsecurities lending agent. To the extent that a\nFund engages in securities lending, BlackRock\nInstitutional Trust Company, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d )\nacts as securities lending agent for the Fund,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC\nadministers the lending program in accordance\nwith guidelines approved by the Trust's Board\nof Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the trustees of\nwhich are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ). JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d ) serves as\ncustodian for certain Funds in connection with\ncertain securities lending activities.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk\n(i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If a Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Funds'\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, a Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return a Fund\u2019s securities as agreed, the\nFund\u2019s ability to participate in a corporate\naction event may be impacted, or the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. This latter event\ncould trigger adverse tax consequences for a\nFund. A Fund could lose money if its short-\nterm investment of the collateral declines in\nvalue over the period of the loan. Substitute\npayments received by a Fund representing\ndividends paid on securities loaned out by the\nFund will not be considered qualified dividend\nincome. BTC will take into account the tax\neffects on shareholders caused by this\ndifference in connection with a Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to a Fund (as permitted by\napplicable law). Regulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require certain bank-\nregulated counterparties and certain of their\naffiliates to include in certain financial\ncontracts, including many securities lending\nagreements, terms that delay or restrict the\nrights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to\nterminate such agreements, foreclose upon\ncollateral, exercise other default rights or\nrestrict transfers of credit support in the\nevent that the counterparty and/or its\naffiliates are subject to certain types of\nresolution or insolvency proceedings. It is\npossible that these requirements, as well as\npotential additional government regulation and\nother developments in the market, could\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to\nterminate existing securities lending\nagreements or to realize amounts to be\nreceived under such agreements. Prudential\nregulation may also favor lenders that can\nprovide additional protections, such as liens\nthat are exercisable upon lender default, to\nbank borrowers. Certain Funds expect to\nprovide additional protections to bank\nborrowers, where permitted pursuant to a\nFund\u2019s investment policies and if BFA believes\ndoing so is in the best interest of the Fund.\nLiquidity Risk Management. Rule 22e-4 under\nthe Investment Company Act (the \u201c Liquidity\nRule \u201d ) requires open-end funds, including\nexchange-traded funds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) such as the\nFunds, to establish a liquidity risk\nmanagement program (the \u201c Liquidity Program \u201d\n) and enhance disclosures regarding fund\nliquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule,\nthe Funds have implemented a Liquidity\nProgram, and the Board, including a majority\nof the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has\nappointed BFA as the administrator of the\nLiquidity Program. Under the Liquidity\nProgram, BFA assesses, manages, and\nperiodically reviews each Fund\u2019s liquidity\nrisk and classifies each investment held by a\nFund as a \u201c highly liquid investment, \u201d \u201c\nmoderately liquid investment, \u201d \u201c less liquid\ninvestment \u201d or \u201c illiquid investment. \u201d The\nLiquidity Rule defines \u201c liquidity risk \u201d as\nthe risk that a Fund could not meet requests\nto redeem shares issued by a Fund without\nsignificant dilution of the remaining\ninvestors\u2019 interest in a Fund. The liquidity\nof a Fund's portfolio investments is\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment-specific considerations under\nthe Liquidity Program. There are exclusions\nfrom certain portions of the liquidity risk\nmanagement program requirements for \u201c in-kind\n\u201d ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To\nthe extent that an investment is deemed to be\nan illiquid investment or a less liquid\ninvestment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to\ngreater liquidity risk.\n\n6\n\nNon-U.S. Securities. Each Fund may purchase\npublicly traded common stocks of non-U.S.\nissuers. To the extent a Fund invests in\nstocks of non-U.S. issuers, certain of the\nFund's investments in such stocks may be in\nthe form of American Depositary Receipts ( \u201c\nADRs \u201d ), Global Depositary Receipts ( \u201c GDRs\n\u201d ) and European Depositary Receipts ( \u201c EDRs\n\u201d ) (collectively, \u201c depositary receipts \u201d ).\nDepositary receipts are receipts, typically\nissued by a bank or trust issuer, which\nevidence ownership of underlying securities\nissued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary\nreceipts may not necessarily be denominated in\nthe same currency as their underlying\nsecurities. ADRs typically are issued by a\nU.S. bank or trust company and evidence\nownership of underlying securities issued by a\nnon-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes\nreferred to as continental depositary\nreceipts, are receipts issued in Europe,\ntypically by foreign banks and trust\ncompanies, that evidence ownership of either\nforeign or domestic underlying securities.\nGDRs are depositary receipts structured like\nglobal debt issues to facilitate trading on an\ninternational basis. Generally, ADRs, issued\nin registered form, are designed for use in\nthe U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued\nin bearer form, are designed for use in\nEuropean securities markets. GDRs are tradable\nboth in the U.S. and in Europe and are\ndesigned for use throughout the world.\nDepositary receipts are generally subject to\nthe same risks as the foreign securities that\nthey evidence or into which they may be\nconverted. In addition to investment risks\nassociated with the underlying issuer,\ndepositary receipts expose a Fund to\nadditional risks associated with the non-\nuniform terms that apply to depositary receipt\nprograms, credit exposure to the depository\nbank and to the sponsors and other parties\nwith whom the depository bank establishes the\nprograms, currency risk and liquidity risk.\nUnsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned\nby the issuer of the underlying common stock,\ngenerally expose investors to greater risks\nthan sponsored programs and do not provide\nholders with many of the shareholder benefits\nthat come from investing in a sponsored\ndepositary receipts. Investing in the\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers involves\nspecial risks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in U.S. issuers.\nThese include differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards;\nthe possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation; adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations;\npolitical instability, which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in non-U.S. countries; and\npotential restrictions on the flow of\ninternational capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be\nsubject to less governmental regulation than\nU.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S.\neconomies may differ favorably or unfavorably\nfrom the U.S. economy in such respects as\ngrowth of gross domestic product ( \u201c GDP \u201d ),\nrate of inflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and balance of\npayment positions. Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives. The CFTC subjects advisers to\nregistered investment companies to regulation\nby the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the\nadviser either (i) invests, directly or\nindirectly, more than a prescribed level of\nits liquidation value in CFTC-regulated\nfutures, options and swaps ( \u201c CFTC\nDerivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to each of the Funds. BFA is not,\ntherefore, subject to registration or\nregulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA with respect to the Funds. The\niShares ESG MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF,\niShares International Equity Factor ETF,\niShares International Small-Cap Equity Factor\nETF, iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares MSCI EAFE\nGrowth ETF, iShares MSCI EAFE Min Vol Factor\nETF, iShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap ETF, iShares\nMSCI EAFE Value ETF, iShares MSCI Europe\nFinancials ETF, iShares MSCI Europe Small-Cap\nETF, iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF,\niShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor ETF, iShares\nMSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF, iShares MSCI USA\nSize Factor ETF, iShares MSCI USA Small-Cap\nMin Vol Factor ETF, iShares MSCI USA Value\nFactor ETF, iShares U.S. Equity Factor ETF,\niShares U.S. Small-Cap Equity Factor ETF and\niShares U.S. Tech Breakthrough Multisector ETF\n(the \u201c No-Action Letter Funds \u201d ) may also\nhave investments in \u201c underlying funds \u201d (and\nsuch underlying funds themselves may invest in\nunderlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term\n\u201c underlying fund \u201d for purposes of the no-\naction letter referenced below may include,\nbut is not limited to, certain securitized\nvehicles, mortgage or international real\nestate investment trusts, business development\ncompanies and, investment companies that may\ninvest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of the\nforegoing), and therefore may be viewed by the\nCFTC as commodity pools. BFA may not have\ntransparency into the holdings of these\nunderlying funds because they are not advised\nby BFA. To address this issue of lack of\ntransparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-\naction letter on November 29, 2012 permitting\nthe adviser of a fund that invests in such\nunderlying funds and that would otherwise have\nfiled a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC\nRule 4.5 to delay registration as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d until six months\nfrom the date on which the CFTC issues\nadditional guidance on the treatment of CFTC\nDerivatives held by\n\n7\n\nunderlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-\nAction Letter Funds, has filed a claim with\nthe CFTC for the Funds to rely on this no-\naction relief. Accordingly, BFA is not\ncurrently subject to registration or\nregulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA in respect of the Funds.\nDerivative contracts, including, without\nlimitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-\ndeliverable forwards, are subject to\nregulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act ( \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under comparable\nregimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.\njurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards\nand certain other derivatives traded in the\nOTC market are subject to variation margin and\ninitial margin requirements. Implementation of\nthe margining and other provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory\ntrading, reporting and documentation of swaps\nand other derivatives have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact the costs to a Fund of\ntrading these instruments and, as a result,\nmay affect returns to investors in a Fund.\nRule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act\npermits a Fund to enter into Derivatives\nTransactions (as defined below) and certain\nother transactions notwithstanding the\nrestrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior\nsecurities \u201d under Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act. Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act, among other things,\nprohibits open-end funds, including the Funds,\nfrom issuing or selling any \u201c senior security,\n\u201d other than borrowing from a bank (subject to\na requirement to maintain 300% \u201c asset\ncoverage \u201d ). Under Rule 18f-4, \u201c Derivatives\nTransactions \u201d include the following: (1) any\nswap, security-based swap (including a\ncontract for differences), futures contract,\nforward contract, option (excluding purchased\noptions), any combination of the foregoing, or\nany similar instrument, under which a Fund is\nor may be required to make any payment or\ndelivery of cash or other assets during the\nlife of the instrument or at maturity or early\ntermination, whether as margin or settlement\npayment or otherwise; (2) any short sale\nborrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions (e.g.,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nand borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat\nthese transactions as Derivatives Transactions\nunder Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or\nforward-settling securities (e.g., firm and\nstandby commitments, including to-be-announced\n( \u201c TBA \u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and\nnon-standard settlement cycle securities,\nunless the Fund intends to physically settle\nthe transaction and the transaction will\nsettle within 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\nUnless a Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to\nadopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if a Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Repurchase\nAgreements. A repurchase agreement is an\ninstrument under which the purchaser ( i.e. ,\na Fund) acquires a security and the seller\nagrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase\nthe security at a mutually agreed-upon time\nand price, thereby determining the yield\nduring the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by a Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Fund may suffer\ntime delays and incur costs or losses in\nconnection with the disposition of the\ncollateral. In any repurchase transaction, the\ncollateral for a repurchase agreement may\ninclude: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations\nissued by the U.S. government or its agencies\nor instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations\nthat, at the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for a\nFund that utilizes them. Such risks are not\nunique to the Funds, but are inherent in\nrepurchase agreements. The Funds seek to\nminimize such risks, but because of the\ninherent legal uncertainties\n\n8\n\ninvolved in repurchase agreements, such risks\ncannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral\nand collateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, a Fund\nwould likely retain the status of an unsecured\ncreditor of the counterparty ( i.e. , the\nposition a Fund would normally be in if it\nwere to hold, pursuant to its investment\npolicies, other unsecured debt securities of\nthe defaulting counterparty) with respect to\nthe amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured\ncreditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing\nsome or all of the principal and income\ninvolved in the transaction. Reverse\nRepurchase Agreements. Reverse repurchase\nagreements involve the sale of securities with\nan agreement to repurchase the securities at\nan agreed-upon price, date and interest\npayment and have the characteristics of\nborrowing. Generally, the effect of such\ntransactions is that a Fund can recover all or\nmost of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are advantageous\nonly if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a\nrate of interest on the cash derived from\nthese transactions that is greater than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available, and a Fund intends to use\nthe reverse repurchase technique only when BFA\nbelieves it will be advantageous to the Fund.\nThe use of reverse repurchase agreements may\nexaggerate any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of a Fund\u2019s assets. The use of reverse\nrepurchase agreements is a form of leverage,\nand the proceeds obtained by a Fund through\nreverse repurchase agreements may be invested\nin additional securities. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits a Fund to enter\ninto reverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions ( e.g., recourse and\nnon-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed\nbonds) notwithstanding the limitation on the\nissuance of senior securities in Section 18 of\nthe Investment Company Act, provided that a\nFund either (i) complies with the 300% asset\ncoverage ratio with respect to such\ntransactions and any other borrowings in the\naggregate, or (ii) treats such transactions as\nDerivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4.\n(See \u201c Regulation Regarding Derivatives \u201d\nabove.) Securities of Investment Companies.\nEach Fund may invest in the securities of\nother investment companies (including money\nmarket funds) and real estate investment\ntrusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ) to the extent permitted\nby law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment in registered investment companies\nis generally limited to, subject to certain\nexceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of any one investment company;\n(ii) 5% of a Fund\u2019s total assets with respect\nto any one investment company; and (iii) 10%\nof a Fund\u2019s total assets with respect to\ninvestment companies in the aggregate. Other\ninvestment companies in which a Fund may\ninvest can be expected to incur fees and\nexpenses for operations, such as investment\nadvisory and administration fees, which would\nbe in addition to those incurred by the Fund.\nPursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff,\nfees and expenses of money market funds used\nfor cash collateral received in connection\nwith loans of securities are not treated as\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect\na Fund\u2019s pro rata share of the fees and\nexpenses incurred by investing in other\ninvestment companies (as disclosed in the\nProspectus, as applicable). Short-Term\nInstruments and Temporary Investments. Each\nFund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, on an\nongoing basis to provide liquidity or for\nother reasons. Money market instruments are\ngenerally short-term investments that may\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) shares of\nmoney market funds (including those advised by\nBFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c\nCDs \u201d ), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed-time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nnon-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches)\nand similar institutions; (iv) commercial\npaper rated, at the date of purchase, \u201c\nPrime-1 \u201d by Moody's \u00ae Investors Service,\nInc., \u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch Ratings, Inc., or \u201c A-1\n\u201d by Standard & Poor's \u00ae Financial Services\nLLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global, Inc. ( \u201c S&P\nGlobal Ratings \u201d ), or if unrated, of\ncomparable quality as determined by BFA; (v)\nnon-convertible corporate debt securities (\ne.g. , bonds and debentures) with remaining\nmaturities at the date of purchase of not more\nthan 397 days and that have been determined to\npresent minimal credit risks, in accordance\nwith the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7\nunder the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase\nagreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-\ndenominated obligations of non-U.S. banks\n(including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion\nof BFA, are of comparable quality to\nobligations of U.S. banks that may be\npurchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments\nmay be purchased on a current or forward-\nsettled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions.\n\n9\n\nSwap Agreements. Swap agreements are contracts\nbetween parties in which one party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the other party\nbased on a pre-determined underlying\ninvestment or notional amount. In return, the\nother party agrees to make periodic payments\nto the first party based on the return (or a\ndifferential in rate of return) earned or\nrealized on the underlying investment or\nnotional amount. Swap agreements will usually\nbe performed on a net basis, with a Fund\nreceiving or paying only the net amount of the\ntwo payments. The net amount of the excess, if\nany, of a Fund\u2019s obligations over its\nentitlements with respect to each swap is\naccrued on a daily basis. Certain of the Funds\nor Underlying Funds may enter into currency\nswaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps, or\ntotal return swaps (some of which may be\nreferred to as contracts for difference or \u201c\nCFDs \u201d ). The use of swaps is a highly\nspecialized activity that involves investment\ntechniques and risks different from those\nassociated with ordinary portfolio security\ntransactions. These transactions generally do\nnot involve the delivery of securities or\nother underlying assets. Tracking Stocks. A\ntracking stock is a separate class of common\nstock whose value is linked to a specific\nbusiness unit or operating division within a\nlarger company and is designed to \u201c track \u201d\nthe performance of such business unit or\ndivision. The tracking stock may pay dividends\nto shareholders independent of the parent\ncompany. The parent company, rather than the\nbusiness unit or division, generally is the\nissuer of tracking stock. However, holders of\nthe tracking stock may not have the same\nrights as holders of the company\u2019s common\nstock. Future Developments. The Board may, in\nthe future, authorize each Fund to invest in\nsecurities contracts and investments, other\nthan those listed in this SAI and in the\napplicable Prospectuses, provided they are\nconsistent with each Fund's investment\nobjective and do not violate any of its\ninvestment restrictions or policies. General\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of some\nof the principal risks associated with an\ninvestment in a Fund is contained in the\napplicable Prospectus. An investment in a Fund\nshould be made with an understanding that the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of stocks in\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce a Fund\u2019s return.\nBorrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to\ndo so to satisfy its obligations. Commodities\nInvestment Risk. Exposure to commodities\nmarkets may subject a Fund to greater\nvolatility than investments in traditional\nsecurities. The commodities markets have\nexperienced periods of extreme volatility.\nSimilar future market conditions may result in\nrapid and substantial valuation increases or\ndecreases in a Fund\u2019s holdings. The\ncommodities markets may fluctuate widely based\non a variety of factors. Movements in\ncommodity investment prices are outside of a\nFund's control and may not be anticipated by\nBFA. Price movements may be influenced by,\namong other things: governmental,\nagricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary and\nexchange control programs and policies;\nchanging market and economic conditions;\nmarket liquidity; weather and climate\nconditions, including droughts and floods;\nlivestock disease; changing supply and demand\nrelationships and levels of domestic\nproduction and imported commodities; changes\nin storage costs; the availability of local,\nintrastate and interstate transportation\nsystems; energy conservation; the success of\nexploration projects; changes in international\nbalances of payments and trade; domestic and\nforeign rates of inflation; currency\ndevaluations and revaluations; domestic and\nforeign political and economic events;\ndomestic and foreign interest rates and/or\ninvestor expectations concerning interest\nrates; foreign currency/exchange rates;\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation\nand taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other\npolitical upheaval and conflicts; governmental\nexpropriation; investment and trading\nactivities of mutual funds, hedge funds and\ncommodities funds; and changes in philosophies\nand emotions of market participants. The\nfrequency and magnitude of such changes cannot\nbe predicted. The prices of commodities can\nalso fluctuate widely due to supply and demand\ndisruptions in major producing or consuming\nregions. Certain commodities or natural\nresources may be produced in a limited number\nof countries and may be controlled by a small\nnumber of producers or groups of producers. As\na result, political, economic, regulatory and\nsupply-related events in such countries could\nhave a disproportionate impact on the prices\nof such commodities.\n\n10\n\nA decrease in the production of a physical\ncommodity or a decrease in the volume of such\ncommodity available for transportation,\nmining, processing, storage or distribution\nmay adversely impact the financial performance\nof a commodity or commodity-related company\nthat devotes a portion of its business to that\ncommodity. Production declines and volume\ndecreases could be caused by various factors,\nincluding catastrophic events affecting\nproduction, depletion of resources, labor\ndifficulties, environmental proceedings,\nincreased regulations, equipment failures and\nunexpected maintenance problems, import supply\ndisruption, governmental expropriation,\npolitical upheaval or conflicts or increased\ncompetition from alternative energy sources or\ncommodity prices. Agricultural commodities may\nbe adversely affected by weather or other\nnatural phenomena, such as drought, floods and\npests. A sustained decline in demand for such\ncommodities could also adversely affect the\nfinancial performance of commodity-related\ncompanies. Factors that could lead to a\ndecline in demand include economic recession\nor other adverse economic conditions, higher\ntaxes on commodities or increased governmental\nregulations, increases in fuel economy,\nconsumer shifts to the use of alternative\ncommodities or fuel sources, changes in\ncommodity prices, or weather. The commodity\nmarkets are subject to temporary distortions\nand other disruptions due to, among other\nfactors, lack of liquidity, the participation\nof speculators, and government regulation and\nother actions. U.S. futures exchanges and some\nforeign exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation in futures contract prices which\nmay occur in a single business day (generally\nreferred to as \u201c daily price fluctuation\nlimits \u201d ). The maximum or minimum price of a\ncontract as a result of these limits is\nreferred to as a \u201c limit price. \u201d If the limit\nprice has been reached in a particular\ncontract, no trades may be made beyond the\nlimit price. Limit prices have the effect of\nprecluding trading in a particular contract or\nforcing the liquidation of contracts at\ndisadvantageous times or prices. Custody Risk.\nCustody risk refers to the risks inherent in\nthe process of clearing and settling trades\nand to the holding of securities, cash and\nother assets by local banks, agents and\ndepositories. Low trading volumes and volatile\nprices in less developed markets make trades\nharder to complete and settle, and governments\nor trade groups may compel local agents to\nhold securities in designated depositories\nthat may not be subject to independent\nevaluation. Local agents are held only to the\nstandards of care of their local markets, and\nthus may be subject to limited or no\ngovernment oversight. Communications between\nthe U.S. and emerging market countries may be\nunreliable, increasing the risk of delayed\nsettlements or losses of security\ncertificates. In general, the less developed a\ncountry\u2019s securities market is, the greater\nthe likelihood of custody problems. Practices\nin relation to the settlement of securities\ntransactions in emerging markets involve\nhigher risks than those in developed markets,\nin part because of the use of brokers and\ncounterparties that are often less well\ncapitalized, and custody and registration of\nassets in some countries may be unreliable.\nThe possibility of fraud, negligence or undue\ninfluence being exerted by the issuer or\nrefusal to recognize ownership exists in some\nemerging markets, and, along with other\nfactors, could result in ownership\nregistration being lost. In addition, the laws\nof certain countries may put limits on a\nFund\u2019s ability to recover its assets if a\nforeign bank or depository or issuer of a\nsecurity or an agent of any of the foregoing\ngoes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss\nresulting from such custody problems and may\nhave no successful claim for compensation.\nDividend-Paying Stock Risk. Investing in\ndividend-paying stocks involves the risk that\nsuch stocks may fall out of favor with\ninvestors and underperform the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of the stocks held by a Fund will not\ndeclare dividends in the future or will reduce\nor eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends) in the future. Illiquid Investments\nRisk. Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that a Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without significantly changing the market\nvalue of the investment. The liquidity of an\ninvestment will be determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment\nspecific considerations as set out in the\nLiquidity Program as required by the Liquidity\nRule. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Money Market\nInstruments Risk. A Fund may hold money market\ninstruments. The value of money market\ninstruments may be affected by changes in\ninterest rates or in the credit ratings of the\ninvestments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of a Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\n\n11\n\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. It is possible to\nlose money by investing in a money market\nfund. Money market funds other than U.S.\ngovernment money market funds and retail money\nmarket funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV instead of\nusing a stable $1.00 per share price. National\nClosed Market Trading Risk. To the extent that\nthe underlying securities held by a Fund trade\non foreign exchanges or in foreign markets\nthat are closed when the securities exchange\non which a Fund\u2019s shares trade is open, there\nare likely to be deviations between the\ncurrent price of such an underlying security\nand the last quoted price for the underlying\nsecurity ( i.e. , a Fund\u2019s quote from the\nclosed foreign market). The impact of a closed\nforeign market on a Fund is likely to be\ngreater where a large portion of a Fund\u2019s\nunderlying securities and/or other assets\ntrade on that closed foreign market or when\nthe foreign market is closed for unscheduled\nreasons. These deviations may result in\npremiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s NAV that may\nbe greater than those experienced by other\nETFs. Operational Risk. BFA and a Fund's other\nservice providers may experience disruptions\nor operating errors such as processing errors\nor human errors, inadequate or failed internal\nor external processes, or systems or\ntechnology failures, that could negatively\nimpact the Funds. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from a Fund\u2019s in the setting of\npriorities, the personnel and resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. BFA, through its monitoring and\noversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect a\nFund or to develop processes and controls to\ncompletely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Reference Rate\nReplacement Risk. A Fund may be exposed to\nfinancial instruments that recently\ntransitioned from, or continue to be tied to,\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate ( \u201c LIBOR \u201d\n) to determine payment obligations, financing\nterms, hedging strategies or investment value.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct\nAuthority ( \u201c FCA \u201d ), which regulates LIBOR,\nhas ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In\nApril 2023, however, the FCA announced that\nsome USD LIBOR settings will continue to be\npublished under a synthetic methodology until\nSeptember 30, 2024 for certain legacy\ncontracts. The Secured Overnight Financing\nRate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which is a broad measure of\nthe cost of borrowing cash overnight\ncollateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in\nthe repurchase agreement market, has been used\nincreasingly on a voluntary basis in new\ninstruments and transactions. Under U.S.\nregulations that implement a statutory\nfallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark\nrates based on SOFR have replaced LIBOR in\ndifferent categories of financial contracts.\nNeither the effect of the LIBOR transition\nprocess nor its ultimate success can yet be\nknown. While some existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate-setting methodology, there\nmay be significant uncertainty regarding the\neffectiveness of any such alternative\nmethodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all\nexisting LIBOR-based instruments may have\nalternative rate-setting provisions and there\nremains uncertainty regarding the willingness\nand ability of issuers to add alternative\nrate-setting provisions in certain existing\ninstruments. Parties to contracts, securities,\nor other instruments using LIBOR may disagree\non transition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. A Fund may have\ninstruments linked to other interbank offered\nrates that may also cease to be published in\nthe future. Risk of Derivatives. A derivative\nis a financial contract, the value of which\ndepends on, or is derived from, the value of\nan underlying asset, such as a security, a\ncommodity (such as gold or silver), a currency\nor an index (a measure of value or rates, such\nas the S&P 500 \u00ae or the prime lending rate). A\nFund may invest in futures contracts,\nsecurities options, CFDs (for the iShares U.S.\nSmall-Cap Equity Factor ETF) and other\nderivatives. Compared to securities,\nderivatives can be more sensitive to changes\nin interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in\nmarket prices and thus a Fund\u2019s losses may be\ngreater if it invests in derivatives than if\nit invests only in conventional securities.\nDerivatives are also subject to counterparty\nrisk, which is the risk that the other party\nin the transaction will not fulfill its\ncontractual obligations. Derivatives generally\ninvolve the incurrence of leverage. When a\nderivative is used as a hedge against a\nposition that a Fund holds or is committed to\npurchase, any loss generated by the derivative\ngenerally should be substantially offset by\ngains on the hedged investment, and vice\nversa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate\nlosses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains,\nand in some cases, hedging can cause losses\nthat are not offset by gains, and a Fund will\nrecognize losses on both the investment and\nthe hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to\n\n12\n\nimperfect matching between the derivative and\nthe underlying security, and there can be no\nassurance that a Fund's hedging transactions,\nwhich entail additional transaction costs,\nwill be effective. Risk of Equity Securities.\nAn investment in a Fund should be made with an\nunderstanding of the risks inherent in an\ninvestment in equity securities, including the\nrisk that the financial condition of issuers\nmay become impaired or that the general\ncondition of stock markets may deteriorate\n(either of which may cause a decrease in the\nvalue of the portfolio securities and thus in\nthe value of shares of the Fund). Common\nstocks are susceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations and to increases and decreases in\nvalue as market confidence and perceptions of\ntheir issuers change. These investor\nperceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Common stocks may experience extreme\nprice volatility due to actions taken by\nparticular investors or groups of investors\n(for example, retail investors influenced by\nsocial media activity or other media coverage\nor significant \u201c short \u201d positions taken by\ninstitutional investors). Holders of common\nstocks incur more risks than holders of\npreferred stocks and debt obligations because\ncommon stockholders generally have rights to\nreceive payments from stock issuers that are\ninferior to the rights of creditors, or\nholders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (the value of which,\nhowever, is subject to market fluctuations\nprior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stocks have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity date. In addition, issuers may, in\ntimes of distress or at their own discretion,\ndecide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which\nmay also cause their stock price to decline.\nAlthough most of the securities in each\nUnderlying Index are listed on a securities\nexchange, the principal trading market for\nsome of the securities may be in the OTC\nmarket. The existence of a liquid trading\nmarket for certain securities may depend on\nwhether dealers will make a market in such\nsecurities. There can be no assurance that a\nmarket will be made or maintained or that any\nsuch market will be or remain liquid. The\nprice at which securities may be sold and the\nvalue of a Fund\u2019s shares will be adversely\naffected if trading markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities are limited or absent, or\nif bid/ask spreads are wide. Risk of Futures\nand Options on Futures Transactions. There are\nseveral risks accompanying the utilization of\nfutures contracts and options on futures\ncontracts. A position in futures contracts and\noptions on futures contracts may be closed\nonly on the exchange on which the contract was\nmade (or a linked exchange). While each Fund\nplans to utilize futures contracts only if an\nactive market exists for such contracts, there\nis no guarantee that a liquid market will\nexist for the contract at a specified time.\nFutures contracts, by definition, project\nprice levels in the future and not current\nlevels of valuation; therefore, market\ncircumstances may result in a discrepancy\nbetween the price of the future and the\nmovement in a Fund's Underlying Index. In the\nevent of adverse price movements, a Fund would\ncontinue to be required to make daily cash\npayments to maintain its required margin. In\nsuch situations, if a Fund has insufficient\ncash, it may have to sell portfolio securities\nto meet daily margin requirements at a time\nwhen it may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, a Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit their risk exposure to\nlevels comparable to a direct investment in\nthe types of stocks in which they invest.\nUtilization of futures and options on futures\nby a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or\neven negative correlation to its Underlying\nIndex if the index underlying the futures\ncontract differs from the Underlying Index.\nThere is also the risk of loss of margin\ndeposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom a Fund has an open position\nin the futures contract or option. The\npurchase of put or call options will be based\nupon predictions by BFA as to anticipated\ntrends, which predictions could prove to be\nincorrect. Because the futures market\ngenerally imposes less burdensome margin\nrequirements than the securities market, an\nincreased amount of participation by\nspeculators in the futures market could result\nin price fluctuations. Certain financial\nfutures exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation permitted in futures contract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\n\n13\n\nlimit establishes the maximum amount by which\nthe price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, each\nFund would be required to make daily cash\npayments of variation margin. Risk of\nInvesting in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. An\ninvestment in any of the Funds that invest,\ndirectly or indirectly, in non-U.S. equity\nsecurities involves risks similar to those of\ninvesting in portfolios of equity securities\ntraded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks\ninclude market fluctuations caused by such\nfactors as economic and political developments\nin those foreign countries, changes in\ninterest rates and perceived trends in stock\nprices. Investing in securities issued by\nissuers domiciled in countries other than the\ndomicile of the investor and denominated in\ncurrencies other than an investor\u2019s local\ncurrency entails certain considerations and\nrisks not typically encountered by the\ninvestor in making investments in its home\ncountry and in that country\u2019s currency. These\nconsiderations include favorable or\nunfavorable changes in interest rates,\ncurrency exchange rates, exchange control\nregulations and the costs that may be incurred\nin connection with conversions between various\ncurrencies. Investing in any of the Funds also\ninvolves certain risks and considerations not\ntypically associated with investing in a fund\nwhose portfolio contains exclusively\nsecurities of U.S. issuers. These risks\ninclude generally less liquid and less\nefficient securities markets; generally\ngreater price volatility; less publicly\navailable information about issuers; the\nimposition of withholding or other taxes; the\nimposition of restrictions on the expatriation\nof funds or other assets of the Funds; higher\ntransaction and custody costs; delays and\nrisks attendant in settlement procedures;\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual\nobligations; lower liquidity and significantly\nsmaller market capitalization; different\naccounting and disclosure standards; lower\nlevels of regulation of the securities\nmarkets; more substantial government\ninterference with the economy and businesses;\nhigher rates of inflation; greater social,\neconomic, and political uncertainty; the risk\nof nationalization or expropriation of assets;\nand the risk of war. Risk of Swap Agreements.\nThe risk of loss with respect to swaps is\ngenerally limited to the net amount of\npayments that a Fund is contractually\nobligated to make. Swap agreements are subject\nto the risk that the swap counterparty will\ndefault on its obligations to pay a Fund and\nthe risk that a Fund will not be able to meet\nits obligations to pay the other party to the\nagreement. If such a default occurs, the\nparties will have contractual remedies\npursuant to the agreements related to the\ntransaction. However, such remedies may be\nsubject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws,\nwhich could affect such Fund\u2019s rights as a\ncreditor ( e.g. , a Fund may not receive the\nnet amount of payments that it is\ncontractually entitled to receive). Swap\nagreements may also involve the risk that\nthere is an imperfect correlation between the\nreturn on a Fund's obligation to its\ncounterparty and the return on the referenced\nasset. In addition, swap agreements are\nsubject to market and liquidity risk, leverage\nrisk and hedging risk. A Fund is required to\npost and collect variation margin and initial\nmargin (comprised of specified liquid\nsecurities subject to haircuts) in connection\nwith trading of OTC swaps. These requirements\nmay raise the costs for a Fund\u2019s investment in\nswaps. Tracking Error Risk. A Fund may be\nsubject to tracking error, which is the\ndivergence of a Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the applicable underlying index. Tracking\nerror may occur because of differences between\nthe securities and other instruments held in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio and those included in its\napplicable underlying index, pricing\ndifferences, transaction costs incurred by a\nFund, a Fund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash,\ndifferences in timing of the accrual of or the\nvaluation of dividends or interest received by\na Fund or distributions paid to a Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, the requirements to maintain\npass-through tax treatment, portfolio\ntransactions carried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to shareholders,\nacceptance of custom baskets, changes to the\napplicable underlying index or the costs to a\nFund of complying with various new or existing\nregulatory requirements. This risk may be\nheightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result because a Fund\nincurs fees and expenses, while its applicable\nunderlying index does not. Tracking error may\noccur due to differences between the\nmethodologies used in calculating the value of\nthe applicable Underlying Index and\ndetermining a Fund\u2019s NAV. When an issuer is\nintroduced by an index provider into an index\ntracked by a Fund, BFA may conduct an analysis\non such issuer\u2019s securities to identify and\nscreen for outlier high risk behavior (such as\nrapid or unusual price growth that does not\nappear to be supported by publicly available\ninformation on the business and assets of the\nissuer, unusual or significant short interest\nor lending activity, negative sentiment,\nsuspended trading or incorrect free-float\ncalculations, which could be indicators of\npossible irregularities, miscalculations or\neven fraud). If it identifies such behavior,\nBFA may, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to\n\n14\n\ncontinue to include the issuer\u2019s securities in\nthe rebalancing of its index. If the\nsecurities continue to be included in the\nindex, BFA may underweight or exclude such\nsecurities from a Fund\u2019s portfolio and, if it\ndoes so, such a fund will be subject to\nincreased tracking error due to the divergence\nin the securities included in its portfolio\nfrom its underlying index. The application of\nthe abovementioned analysis and screening to a\nFund and its Underlying Index is in the sole\ndiscretion of BFA and its affiliates (without\nany guarantees). The analysis and screening\nmay not exclude any or all high risk\nsecurities from an Underlying Index or a\nFund\u2019s portfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\na Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more such\nsecurities declines in value. Volatility Risk.\nThe value of a security may fluctuate due to\nfactors affecting markets generally or\nparticular industries. This volatility may\naffect a Fund's NAV. Although certain of the\nUnderlying Indexes were created to seek lower\nabsolute volatility, there is no guarantee\nthat these strategies will be successful. An\nunderlying index's index provider may be\nunsuccessful in creating an index that\nminimizes volatility, and there is a risk that\neach Fund may experience more than minimum\nvolatility. Securities in the Funds'\nportfolios may be subject to price volatility\nand their prices may not be any less volatile\nthan the market as a whole and could be more\nvolatile. Events or financial circumstances\naffecting individual securities or sectors may\nincrease the volatility of the Funds. Risk of\nInvesting in Asia. Investments in securities\nof issuers in certain Asian countries involve\nrisks not typically associated with\ninvestments in securities of issuers in other\nregions. Such heightened risks include, among\nothers, expropriation and/or nationalization\nof assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of\nintellectual property, data and other security\nbreaches (especially of data stored\nelectronically), political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision-making,\narmed conflict and social instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or socio-\neconomic unrest. Certain Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid rates of economic growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, and there\nis no assurance that these rates of economic\ngrowth and industrialization will be\nmaintained. Certain Asian countries have\ndemocracies with relatively short histories,\nwhich may increase the risk of political\ninstability. These countries have faced\npolitical and military unrest, and further\nunrest could present a risk to their local\neconomies and securities markets. Indonesia\nand the Philippines have each experienced\nviolence and terrorism, which has negatively\nimpacted their economies. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect Asian issuers that\nrely on the U.S. for trade. Political,\nreligious, and border disputes persist in\nIndia. India has recently experienced and may\ncontinue to experience civil unrest and\nhostilities with certain of its neighboring\ncountries. Increased political and social\nunrest in these geographic areas could\nadversely affect the performance of\ninvestments in this region. Certain\ngovernments in this region administer prices\non several basic goods, including fuel and\nelectricity, within their respective\ncountries. Certain governments may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector in their respective countries\nand may own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in this\nregion, which in turn could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments adversely affecting investments\nin the region. Corruption and the perceived\nlack of a rule of law in dealings with\ninternational companies in certain Asian\ncountries may discourage foreign investment\nand could negatively impact the long-term\ngrowth of certain economies in this region. In\naddition, certain countries in the region are\nexperiencing high unemployment and corruption,\nand have fragile banking sectors. Some\neconomies in this region are dependent on a\nrange of commodities, including oil, natural\ngas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly\naffected by international commodity prices and\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. The market\nfor securities in this region may also be\ndirectly influenced by the flow of\ninternational capital, and by the economic and\nmarket conditions of neighboring countries.\nChina is a key trading partner of many Asian\ncountries and any changes in trading\nrelationships between China and other Asian\ncountries may affect the region as a whole.\nAdverse economic conditions or developments in\nneighboring countries may increase investors'\nperception of the risk of investing in the\nregion as a whole, which may adversely impact\nthe market value of the securities issued by\ncompanies in the region.\n\n15\n\nRisk of Investing in Australasia. The\neconomies of Australasia, which include\nAustralia and New Zealand, are dependent on\nexports from the agricultural and mining\nsectors. This makes Australasian economies\nsusceptible to fluctuations in the commodity\nmarkets. Australasian economies are also\nincreasingly dependent on their growing\nservice and tourism industries. Australia and\nNew Zealand are located in a part of the world\nthat has historically been prone to natural\ndisasters, such as drought and flooding. Any\nsuch event in the future could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the economies of\nAustralia and New Zealand and affect the value\nof securities held by a relevant Fund. The\neconomies of Australia and New Zealand are\ndependent on trading with certain key trading\npartners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic\nevents in the U.S., Asia, or in other key\ntrading countries can have a significant\neconomic effect on the Australasian economies.\nThe economies of Australia and New Zealand are\nheavily dependent on the mining sector.\nPassage of new regulations limiting foreign\nownership of companies in the mining sector or\nimposition of new taxes on profits of mining\ncompanies may dissuade foreign investment, and\nas a result, have a negative impact on\ncompanies to which a Fund has exposure. Risk\nof Investing in China. Investments in\nsecurities of companies domiciled in China\ninvolve a high degree of risk and special\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the U.S. securities markets. Such\nheightened risks include, among others, an\nauthoritarian government, popular unrest\nassociated with demands for improved\npolitical, economic and social conditions, the\nimpact of regional conflict on the economy and\nhostile relations with neighboring countries.\nMilitary conflicts, either in response to\ninternal social unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries, could disrupt economic development.\nThe Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-\nrunning disagreements and religious and\nnationalist disputes with Tibet and the\nXinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been\ntensions between the Chinese government and\nmany people in Hong Kong who perceive China as\ntightening control over Hong Kong\u2019s semi-\nautonomous liberal political, economic, legal,\nand social framework. Recent protests and\nunrest have increased tensions even further.\nDue to the interconnected nature of the Hong\nKong and Chinese economies, this instability\nin Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong\nKong and Chinese markets. China has a complex\nterritorial dispute regarding the sovereignty\nof Taiwan and has made threats of invasion.\nTaiwan-based companies and individuals are\nsignificant investors in China. Military\nconflict between China and Taiwan may\nadversely affect securities of Chinese\nissuers. In addition, China has strained\ninternational relations with Japan, India,\nRussia and other neighbors due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities and other\ndefense concerns. Additionally, China is\nalleged to have participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Actual and\nthreatened responses to such activity and\nstrained international relations, including\npurchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which a\nFund invests. China could be affected by\nmilitary events on the Korean peninsula or\ninternal instability within North Korea. These\nsituations may cause uncertainty in the\nChinese market and may adversely affect the\nperformance of the Chinese economy. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, the Chinese government still\nexercises substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Chinese companies,\nsuch as those in the financial services or\ntechnology sectors, and potentially other\nsectors in the future, are subject to the risk\nthat Chinese authorities can intervene in\ntheir operations and structure. The Chinese\ngovernment continues to maintain a major role\nin economic policymaking, and investing in\nChina involves risk of loss due to\nexpropriation, nationalization, confiscation\nof assets and property or the imposition of\nrestrictions on foreign investments and on\nrepatriation of capital invested. A Fund may\ninvest in securities issued by variable\ninterest entities ( \u201c VIEs \u201d ), which are\nsubject to the investment risks associated\nwith the underlying Chinese operating company.\nA VIE enters into service contracts and other\ncontracts with the Chinese operating company,\nwhich provide the VIE with exposure to the\ncompany. Although the VIE has no equity\nownership of the Chinese operating company,\nthe contractual arrangements permit the VIE to\nconsolidate the Chinese operating company into\nits financial statements. Intervention by the\nChinese government with respect to VIEs could\nsignificantly affect the Chinese operating\ncompany\u2019s performance and the enforceability\nof the VIE\u2019s contractual arrangements with the\nChinese company. In addition, there is less\nregulation and monitoring of Chinese\nsecurities markets and the activities of\ninvestors, brokers and other participants than\nin the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities\nin China, including Chinese companies that are\nlisted on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to\nthe same degree of regulation as are U.S.\nissuers with respect to such matters as\ninsider trading rules, tender offer\nregulation, accounting standards or auditor\noversight, stockholder proxy requirements and\nthe requirements mandating timely and accurate\ndisclosure of information. Securities markets\nin China are in the process of\n\n16\n\nchange and further development. This may lead\nto trading volatility, difficulty in the\nsettlement and recording of transactions and\ndifficulty in interpreting and applying the\nrelevant regulation. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Funds do not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. While the Chinese\neconomy has experienced past periods of rapid\ngrowth, there is no assurance that such growth\nrates will recur. China may experience\nsubstantial rates of inflation, significant\nindebtedness or economic recessions, causing a\nnegative effect on the economy and securities\nmarket. China\u2019s economy is heavily dependent\non export growth. Reduction in spending on\nChinese products and services, supply chain\ndiversification, institution of additional\ntariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions between China and the U.S. or in\nresponse to actual or alleged Chinese cyber\nactivity) or a downturn in any of the\neconomies of China\u2019s key trading partners may\nhave an adverse impact on the Chinese economy\nand the companies in which a Fund invests.\nCertain Chinese companies (which may change\nfrom time to time) are directly or indirectly\nsubject to economic or trade restrictions\nimposed by the U.S. or other governments due\nto national security, human rights or other\nconcerns of such government. For example,\ncertain foreign technology companies are\nsubject to U.S. export controls as those\ncompanies are believed to pose a risk to U.S.\ninterests. The U.S. also bans imports of goods\nproduced in certain regions of China or by\ncertain Chinese companies due to concerns\nabout forced labor. Such restrictions may have\nunanticipated and adverse effects on the\nChinese economy and companies. Any action that\ntargets Chinese financial markets or\nsecurities exchanges could interfere with\norderly trading, delay settlement or cause\nmarket disruptions. The Underlying Index of a\nFund may include companies that are subject to\neconomic or trade restrictions (but not\ninvestment restrictions) imposed by the U.S.\nor other governments. So long as these\nrestrictions do not include restrictions on\ninvestments, the Fund is generally expected to\ninvest in such companies, consistent with its\nobjective to track the performance of its\nUnderlying Index. The tax laws and regulations\nin the People\u2019s Republic of China ( \u201c PRC \u201d )\nare subject to change, including the issuance\nof authoritative guidance or enforcement,\npossibly with retroactive effect. The\ninterpretation, applicability and enforcement\nof such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as\nconsistent and transparent as those of more\ndeveloped nations, and may vary over time and\nfrom region to region. The application and\nenforcement of PRC tax rules could have a\nsignificant adverse effect on a Fund and its\ninvestors, particularly in relation to capital\ngains withholding tax imposed upon non-\nresidents. In addition, the accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards and\npractices applicable to Chinese companies may\nbe less rigorous, and may result in\nsignificant differences between financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with the PRC\naccounting standards and practice and those\nprepared in accordance with international\naccounting standards. Risk of Investing in\nDeveloped Countries. Many countries with\ndeveloped markets have recently experienced\nsignificant economic pressures. These\ncountries generally tend to rely on the\nservices sectors ( e.g. , the financial\nservices sector) as the primary source of\neconomic growth and may be susceptible to the\nrisks of individual service sectors. For\nexample, companies in the financial services\nsector are subject to governmental regulation\nand, recently, government intervention, which\nmay adversely affect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and\namount of capital they must maintain.\nDislocations in the financial sector and\nperceived or actual governmental influence\nover certain financial companies may lead to\ncredit rating downgrades and, as a result,\nimpact, among other things, revenue growth for\nsuch companies. If financial companies\nexperience a prolonged decline in revenue\ngrowth, certain developed countries that rely\nheavily on financial companies as an economic\ndriver may experience a correlative slowdown.\nConcerns have emerged with respect to the\neconomic health of certain developed\ncountries. These concerns primarily stem from\nheavy indebtedness of many developed countries\nand their perceived inability to continue to\nservice high debt loads without simultaneously\nimplementing stringent austerity measures.\nSuch concerns have led to tremendous downward\npressure on the economies of these countries.\nAs a result, it is possible that interest\nrates on debt of certain developed countries\nmay rise to levels that make it difficult for\nsuch countries to service such debt. Spending\non health care and retirement pensions in most\ndeveloped countries has risen dramatically.\nMedical innovation, extended life expectancy\nand higher public expectations are likely to\ncontinue the increase in health care and\npension costs. Any increase in health care and\npension costs will likely have a negative\nimpact on the economic growth of many\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries rely on imports of certain key\nitems, such as crude oil, natural gas, and\nother commodities. As a result, an increase in\ndemand for, or price fluctuations of, certain\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Developed market countries\ngenerally are dependent on the economies of\ncertain key trading partners. Changes in any\none economy may cause an adverse impact on\nseveral\n\n17\n\ndeveloped countries. In addition, heavy\nregulation of, among others, labor and product\nmarkets may have an adverse effect on certain\nissuers. Such regulations may negatively\naffect economic growth or cause prolonged\nperiods of recession. Such risks, among\nothers, may adversely affect the value of a\nFund\u2019s investments. Risk of Investing in\nEmerging Markets. Investments in emerging\nmarket countries may be subject to greater\nrisks than investments in developed countries.\nThese risks include: (i) less social,\npolitical, and economic stability; (ii)\ngreater illiquidity and price volatility due\nto smaller or limited local capital markets\nfor such securities, or low or non-existent\ntrading volumes; (iii) companies, custodians,\nclearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-\ndealers may be subject to less scrutiny and\nregulation by local authorities; (iv) local\ngovernments may decide to seize or confiscate\nsecurities held by foreign investors and/or\nlocal governments may decide to suspend or\nlimit an issuer's ability to make dividend or\ninterest payments; (v) local governments may\nlimit or entirely restrict repatriation of\ninvested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi)\ncapital gains may be subject to local\ntaxation, including on a retroactive basis;\n(vii) issuers facing restrictions on standard\npayments imposed by local governments may\nattempt to make dividend or interest payments\nto foreign investors in the local currency;\n(viii) there may be significant obstacles to\nobtaining information necessary for\ninvestigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and investors may experience\ndifficulty in enforcing legal claims related\nto the securities and/or local judges may\nfavor the interests of the issuer over those\nof foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments\nmay only be permitted to be paid in the local\ncurrency; (x) limited public information\nregarding the issuer may result in greater\ndifficulty in determining market valuations of\nthe securities; and (xi) lack of financial\nreporting on a regular basis, substandard\ndisclosure and differences in accounting\nstandards may make it difficult to ascertain\nthe financial health of an issuer. The Funds\nare not actively managed and do not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. Emerging market securities\nmarkets are typically marked by a high\nconcentration of market capitalization and\ntrading volume in a small number of issuers\nrepresenting a limited number of industries,\nas well as a high concentration of ownership\nof such securities by a limited number of\ninvestors. In addition, brokerage and other\ncosts associated with transactions in emerging\nmarket securities can be higher, sometimes\nsignificantly, than similar costs incurred in\nsecurities markets in developed countries.\nAlthough some emerging markets have become\nmore established and tend to issue securities\nof higher credit quality, the markets for\nsecurities in other emerging market countries\nare in the earliest stages of their\ndevelopment, and these countries issue\nsecurities across the credit spectrum. Even\nthe markets for relatively widely traded\nsecurities in emerging market countries may\nnot be able to absorb, without price\ndisruptions, a significant increase in trading\nvolume or trades of a size customarily\nundertaken by institutional investors in the\nsecurities markets of developed countries. The\nlimited size of many of these securities\nmarkets can cause prices to be erratic for\nreasons apart from factors that affect the\nsoundness and competitiveness of the\nsecurities issuers. For example, prices may be\nunduly influenced by traders who control large\npositions in these markets. Additionally,\nmarket making and arbitrage activities are\ngenerally less extensive in such markets,\nwhich may contribute to increased volatility\nand reduced liquidity of such markets. The\nlimited liquidity of emerging market country\nsecurities may also affect a Fund's ability to\naccurately value its portfolio securities or\nto acquire or dispose of securities at the\nprice and time it wishes to do so or in order\nto meet redemption requests. Many emerging\nmarket countries suffer from uncertainty and\ncorruption in their legal frameworks.\nLegislation may be difficult to interpret and\nlaws may be too new to provide any\nprecedential value. Laws regarding foreign\ninvestment and private property may be weak or\nnon-existent. Sudden changes in governments\nmay result in policies which are less\nfavorable to investors such as policies\ndesigned to expropriate or nationalize \u201c\nsovereign \u201d assets. Certain emerging market\ncountries in the past have expropriated large\namounts of private property, in many cases\nwith little or no compensation, and there can\nbe no assurance that such expropriation will\nnot occur in the future. Investment in the\nsecurities markets of certain emerging market\ncountries is restricted or controlled to\nvarying degrees. These restrictions may limit\na Fund's investment in certain emerging market\ncountries and may increase the expenses of the\nFund. Certain emerging market countries\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestments by foreign persons or limit\ninvestment by foreign persons to only a\nspecified percentage of an issuer's\noutstanding securities or a specific class of\nsecurities which may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\ncompany available for purchase by nationals.\nMany emerging market countries lack the\nsocial, political, and economic stability\ncharacteristic of the U.S. Political\ninstability among emerging market countries\ncan be common and may be caused by an uneven\ndistribution of wealth, social unrest, labor\nstrikes, civil wars, and religious oppression.\nEconomic instability in emerging market\ncountries may take the form of: (i) high\ninterest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation,\nincluding hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of\nunemployment or\n\n18\n\nunderemployment; (iv) changes in government\neconomic and tax policies, including\nconfiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of\ntrade barriers. A Fund's income and, in some\ncases, capital gains from foreign securities\nwill be subject to applicable taxation in\ncertain of the emerging market countries in\nwhich it invests, and treaties between the\nU.S. and such countries may not be available\nin some cases to reduce the otherwise\napplicable tax rates. Emerging markets also\nhave different clearance and settlement\nprocedures, and in certain of these emerging\nmarkets there have been times when settlements\nhave been unable to keep pace with the volume\nof securities transactions, making it\ndifficult to conduct such transactions. In the\npast, certain governments in emerging market\ncountries have become overly reliant on the\ninternational capital markets and other forms\nof foreign credit to finance large public\nspending programs, which in the past have\ncaused huge budget deficits. Often, interest\npayments have become too overwhelming for a\ngovernment to meet, representing a large\npercentage of total GDP. These foreign\nobligations have become the subject of\npolitical debate and served as fuel for\npolitical parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\nRisk of Investing in Europe. Investing in\nEuropean countries exposes a Fund to the\neconomic and political risks associated with\nEurope in general and the specific European\ncountries in which it invests. The economies\nand markets of European countries are often\nclosely connected and interdependent, and\nevents in one European country can have an\nadverse impact on other European countries. A\nFund makes investments in securities of\nissuers that are domiciled in, have\nsignificant operations in, or that are listed\non at least one securities exchange within\nmember states of the European Union (the \u201c EU\n\u201d ). A number of countries within the EU are\nalso members of the Economic and Monetary\nUnion (the \u201c eurozone \u201d ) and have adopted the\neuro as their currency. Eurozone membership\nrequires member states to comply with\nrestrictions on inflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates, debt levels and fiscal and\nmonetary controls, each of which may\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe.\nChanges in import or export tariffs, changes\nin governmental or EU regulations on trade,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro and\nother currencies of certain EU countries which\nare not in the eurozone, the default or threat\nof default by an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt, and/or an economic recession\nin an EU member state may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other EU\nmember states and their trading partners.\nAlthough certain European countries are not in\nthe eurozone, many of these countries are\nobliged to meet the criteria for joining the\neurozone. Consequently, these countries must\ncomply with many of the restrictions noted\nabove. The European financial markets have\nexperienced volatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic downturns,\ngovernment debt levels and the possible\ndefault of government debt in several European\ncountries, including, but not limited to,\nAustria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.\nIn order to prevent further economic\ndeterioration, certain countries, without\nprior warning, can institute \u201c capital\ncontrols. \u201d Countries may use these controls\nto restrict volatile movements of capital\nentering and exiting their country. Such\ncontrols may negatively affect a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. A default or debt restructuring\nby any European country would adversely impact\nholders of that country\u2019s debt and sellers of\ncredit default swaps linked to that country\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, which may be located in\ncountries other than those listed above. In\naddition, the credit ratings of certain\nEuropean countries were downgraded in the\npast. These events have adversely affected the\nvalue and exchange rate of the euro and may\ncontinue to significantly affect the economies\nof every country in Europe, including\ncountries that do not use the euro and non-EU\nmember states. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central\nbanks and others, including austerity measures\nand reforms, may not produce the desired\nresults, may result in social unrest and may\nlimit future growth and economic recovery or\nhave other unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The impact of these actions, especially if\nthey occur in a disorderly fashion, is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely impact the value\nof a Fund\u2019s investments in the region.\n\n19\n\nThe United Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) left the EU\n( \u201c Brexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020. Brexit\ncould adversely affect European or worldwide\npolitical, regulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute to instability\nin global political institutions, regulatory\nagencies and financial markets. Certain\nEuropean countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect European issuers\nthat rely on the U.S. for trade. The national\npolitics of countries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding for example, secessionist movements.\nThe governments of European countries may be\nsubject to change and such countries may\nexperience social and political unrest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region also could impact financial\nmarkets. The impact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of a Fund's investments. Russian\nInvasion of Ukraine . Russia launched a large-\nscale invasion of Ukraine on February 24,\n2022. The extent and duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and resulting\nfuture market disruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the value of the\nruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible\nto predict, but could be significant.\nDisruptions caused by Russian military action\nor other actions (including cyberattacks and\nespionage) or resulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity, including\npurchasing and financing restrictions,\nboycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser\npreferences, sanctions, import and export\nrestrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian companies or\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nmay impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which a Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Risk of Investing in Japan. Japan\nmay be subject to political, economic, labor\nand other risks. Any of these risks,\nindividually or in the aggregate, can impact\nan investment made in Japan. Currency Risk .\nThe Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at\ntimes and any increase in its value may cause\na decline in exports that could weaken the\nJapanese economy. Japan has, in the past,\nintervened in the currency markets to attempt\nto maintain or reduce the value of the yen.\nJapanese intervention in the currency markets\ncould cause the value of the yen to fluctuate\nsharply and unpredictably and could cause\nlosses to investors. Economic Risk . The\ngrowth of Japan\u2019s economy has recently lagged\nthat of its Asian neighbors and other major\ndeveloped economies. Since 2000, Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth rate has generally remained\nlow relative to other advanced economies, and\nit may remain low in the future. The Japanese\neconomy is heavily dependent on international\ntrade and has been adversely affected by trade\ntariffs, other protectionist measures,\ncompetition from emerging economies and the\neconomic conditions of its trading partners.\nJapan is also heavily dependent on oil\nimports, and higher commodity prices could\ntherefore have a negative impact on the\nJapanese economy. Geographic Risk . Natural\ndisasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic\neruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur\nin Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy, and,\nin turn, could negatively affect a Fund. Labor\nRisk . Japan has an aging workforce and has\nexperienced a significant population decline\nin recent years. Japan\u2019s labor market appears\nto be undergoing fundamental structural\nchanges, as a labor market traditionally\naccustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to\nmeet the need for increased labor mobility,\nwhich may adversely affect Japan\u2019s economic\ncompetitiveness. Large Government and\nCorporate Debt Risk . The Japanese economy\nfaces several concerns, including a financial\nsystem with large levels of nonperforming\nloans, over-leveraged corporate balance\nsheets, extensive cross-ownership by major\ncorporations, a changing corporate governance\nstructure, and large government deficits.\nThese issues may cause a slowdown of the\nJapanese economy. Political Risk .\nHistorically, Japan has had unpredictable\nnational politics and may experience frequent\npolitical turnover. Future political\ndevelopments may lead to changes in policy\nthat might adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. In addition, China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan. Japan\u2019s\npolitical relationship with China, however,\nhas been strained. Should political tension\nincrease, it could adversely affect the\nJapanese economy and destabilize the region as\na whole.\n\n20\n\nSecurity Risk. Japan's relations with its\nneighbors, particularly China, North Korea,\nSouth Korea and Russia, have at times been\nstrained due to territorial disputes,\nhistorical animosities and defense concerns.\nMost recently, the Japanese government has\nshown concern over the increased nuclear and\nmilitary activity by North Korea and China.\nStrained relations may cause uncertainty in\nthe Japanese markets and adversely affect the\noverall Japanese economy, particularly in\ntimes of crisis. Risk of Investing in the\nMiddle East. Many Middle Eastern countries\nhave little or no democratic tradition, and\nthe political and legal systems in such\ncountries may have an adverse impact on a\nFund. Many economies in the Middle East are\nhighly reliant on income from the sale of oil\nand natural gas or trade with countries\ninvolved in the sale of oil and natural gas,\nand their economies are therefore vulnerable\nto changes in the market for oil and natural\ngas and foreign currency values. As global\ndemand for oil and natural gas fluctuates,\nmany Middle Eastern economies may be\nsignificantly impacted. In addition, many\nMiddle Eastern governments have exercised and\ncontinue to exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector. In\ncertain cases, a Middle Eastern country\u2019s\ngovernment may own or control many companies,\nincluding some of the largest companies in the\ncountry. Accordingly, governmental actions in\nthe future could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Middle Eastern\ncountries. This could affect private sector\ncompanies and a Fund, as well as the value of\nsecurities in a Fund's portfolio. Certain\nMiddle Eastern markets are in the earliest\nstages of development. As a result, there may\nbe a high concentration of market\ncapitalization and trading volume in a small\nnumber of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of investors and financial\nintermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern\ncountries typically are fewer in number and\nless capitalized than brokers in the U.S. The\nlegal systems in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries also may have an adverse impact on a\nFund. For example, the potential liability of\na shareholder in a U.S. corporation with\nrespect to acts of the corporation generally\nis limited to the amount of the shareholder\u2019s\ninvestment. However, the notion of limited\nliability is less clear in certain Middle\nEastern countries. A Fund therefore may be\nliable in certain Middle Eastern countries for\nthe acts of a corporation in which it invests\nfor an amount greater than its actual\ninvestment in that corporation. Similarly, the\nrights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers\nmay be more limited than those of shareholders\nof a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain or enforce a legal\njudgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some\nMiddle Eastern countries prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on investments in\ntheir capital markets, particularly their\nequity markets, by foreign entities such as a\nFund. For example, certain countries may\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestment by foreign persons or limit the\namount of investment by foreign persons in a\nparticular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern\ncountries may also limit investment by foreign\npersons to only a specific class of securities\nof an issuer that may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\nissuer available for purchase by nationals of\nthe relevant Middle Eastern country. The\nmanner in which foreign investors may invest\nin companies in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries, as well as limitations on those\ninvestments, may have an adverse impact on the\noperations of a Fund. For example, in certain\nof these countries, a Fund may be required to\ninvest initially through a local broker or\nother entity and then have the shares that\nwere purchased re-registered in the name of a\nFund. Re-registration in some instances may\nnot be possible on a timely basis. This may\nresult in a delay during which a Fund may be\ndenied certain of its rights as an investor,\nincluding rights as to dividends or to be made\naware of certain corporate actions. There also\nmay be instances where a Fund places a\npurchase order but is subsequently informed,\nat the time of re-registration, that the\npermissible allocation of the investment to\nforeign investors has already been filled and,\nconsequently, a Fund may not be able to invest\nin the relevant company. Substantial\nlimitations may exist in certain Middle\nEastern countries with respect to a Fund\u2019s\nability to repatriate investment income or\ncapital gains. A Fund could be adversely\naffected by delays in, or a refusal to grant,\nany required governmental approval for\nrepatriation of capital, as well as by the\napplication to a Fund of any restrictions on\ninvestment. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nmay be heavily dependent upon international\ntrade and, consequently, have been and may\ncontinue to be negatively affected by trade\nbarriers, exchange controls, managed\nadjustments in relative currency values and\nother protectionist measures imposed or\nnegotiated by the countries with which they\ntrade. These countries also have been and may\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by economic\nconditions in the countries with which they\ntrade. In addition, certain issuers located in\nMiddle Eastern countries in which a Fund\ninvests may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer which operates in, or\nhas dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as\nan investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks.\n\n21\n\nCertain Middle Eastern countries have strained\nrelations with other Middle Eastern countries\ndue to territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, international alliances, defense\nconcerns or other reasons, which may adversely\naffect the economies of these Middle Eastern\ncountries. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nexperience significant unemployment, as well\nas widespread underemployment. There has also\nbeen a recent increase in recruitment efforts\nand an aggressive push for territorial control\nby terrorist groups in the region, which has\nled to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities.\nWarfare in Syria has spread to surrounding\nareas, including many portions of Iraq and\nTurkey. Such hostilities may continue into the\nfuture or may escalate at any time due to\nethnic, racial, political, religious or\nideological tensions between groups in the\nregion or foreign intervention or lack of\nintervention, among other factors. Risk of\nInvesting in the United Kingdom. Investment in\nU.K. issuers will subject a Fund to\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks specific to the U.K. The U.K.\neconomy relies heavily on the export of\nfinancial services to the U.S. and other\nEuropean countries. A prolonged slowdown in\nthe financial services sector may have a\nnegative impact on the U.K.\u2019s economy. In the\npast, the U.K. has been a target of terrorism.\nActs of terrorism in the U.K. or against U.K.\ninterests abroad may cause uncertainty in the\nU.K. financial markets and adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which a Fund\nhas exposure. Secessionist movements, such as\nthe Catalan movement in Spain and the\nindependence movement in Scotland, may have an\nadverse effect on the U.K. economy. On January\n31, 2020, the U.K. officially left the EU\n(Brexit), subject to a transitional period\nthat ended December 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU\nhave reached an agreement on the terms of\ntheir future trading relationship effective\nJanuary 1, 2021, which principally relates to\nthe trading of goods rather than services,\nincluding financial services. Further\ndiscussions are to be held between the U.K.\nand the EU in relation to matters not covered\nby the trade agreement, such as financial\nservices. A Fund will face risks associated\nwith the potential uncertainty and\nconsequences that may follow Brexit, including\nwith respect to volatility in exchange rates\nand interest rates. Brexit could adversely\naffect European or worldwide political,\nregulatory, economic or market conditions and\ncould contribute to instability in global\npolitical institutions, regulatory agencies\nand financial markets. Brexit has also led to\nlegal uncertainty and could lead to\npolitically divergent national laws and\nregulations as a new relationship between the\nU.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines\nwhich EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of\nthese effects of Brexit could adversely affect\nany of the companies to which a Fund has\nexposure and any other assets that a Fund\ninvests in. The political, economic and legal\nconsequences of Brexit are not yet known. In\nthe short term, financial markets may\nexperience heightened volatility, particularly\nthose in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly\nworldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be less\nstable than they have been in recent years,\nand investments in the U.K. and the EU may be\ndifficult to value or subject to greater or\nmore frequent volatility. In the longer term,\nthere is likely to be a period of significant\npolitical, regulatory and commercial\nuncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate\nthe terms of its future trading relationships.\nRecently, the U.K.'s real estate sector has\nexperienced significant volatility and\ndeclines in the value of many real estate\nsecurities, including real estate funds, REITs\nand real estate holding companies. Increased\nvolatility and investor redemption requests in\nreal estate funds may result in the continued\ndecline in the value and liquidity of real\nestate securities, which may impair the\nability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or\ndeliver those securities. U.S. Economic\nTrading Partners Risk. The U.S. is a\nsignificant, and in some cases the most\nsignificant, trading partner of, or foreign\ninvestor in, certain countries in which a Fund\ninvests. As a result, economic conditions of\nsuch countries may be particularly affected by\nchanges in the U.S. economy. A decrease in\nU.S. imports or exports, new trade and\nfinancial regulations or tariffs, changes in\nthe U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic\nslowdown in the U.S. may have a material\nadverse effect on a country\u2019s economic\nconditions and, as a result, securities to\nwhich a Fund has exposure. Circumstances could\narise that could prevent the timely payment of\ninterest or principal on U.S. government debt,\nsuch as reaching the legislative \u201c debt\nceiling. \u201d Such non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences for the U.S.\neconomy and the global financial system. There\nare strained relations between the U.S. and a\nnumber of foreign countries. If these\nrelations were to worsen, it could adversely\naffect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S.\nissuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The\nU.S. has also experienced increased internal\nunrest and discord. If this trend were to\ncontinue, it may have an adverse impact on the\nU.S. economy and many of the issuers in which\na Fund invests. Risk of Investing in the Basic\nMaterials Industry. Issuers in the basic\nmaterials industry could be adversely affected\nby commodity price volatility, inflation,\nexchange rate fluctuations, social and\npolitical unrest, import controls and\nincreased competition. Companies in the basic\nmaterials industry may be subject to swift\nfluctuations in supply and demand.\nFluctuations may be caused by events relating\nto political and economic developments, the\nenvironmental impact of basic materials\noperations, and the success of exploration\nprojects. Production of industrial materials\noften exceeds demand as a\n\n22\n\nresult of over-building or economic downturns,\nleading to poor investment returns. Issuers in\nthe basic materials industry are at risk for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may be adversely affected by\ndepletion of resources, delays in technical\nprogress, labor relations, tax and government\nregulations related to changes to, among other\nthings, energy and environmental policies.\nRisk of Investing in the Communication\nServices Sector. The communication services\nsector consists of both companies in the\ntelecommunication services industry as well as\nthose in the media and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the telecommunication\nservices industry group include providers of\nfiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services and products\nincluding television broadcasting, gaming\nproducts, social media, networking platforms,\nonline classifieds, online review websites,\nand Internet search engines. Companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be affected\nby industry competition, substantial capital\nrequirements, government regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications products and\nservices due to technological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and international demand,\nshifting demographics and often unpredictable\nchanges in consumer tastes can drastically\naffect a communication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Risk of Investing in the Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector. Companies engaged in the\ndesign, production or distribution of products\nor services for the consumer discretionary\nsector (including, without limitation,\ntelevision and radio broadcasting,\nmanufacturing, publishing, recording and\nmusical instruments, motion pictures,\nphotography, amusement and theme parks, gaming\ncasinos, sporting goods and sports arenas,\ncamping and recreational equipment, toys and\ngames, apparel, travel-related services,\nautomobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food\nand other restaurants) are subject to the risk\nthat their products or services may become\nobsolete quickly. The success of these\ncompanies can depend heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending. During\nperiods of an expanding economy, the consumer\ndiscretionary sector may outperform the\nconsumer staples sector, but may underperform\nwhen economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the\nconsumer discretionary sector can be\nsignificantly affected by several factors,\nincluding, without limitation, the performance\n\n23\n\nof domestic and international economies,\nexchange rates, changing consumer preferences,\ndemographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical\nrevenue generation, consumer confidence,\ncommodity price volatility, labor relations,\ninterest rates, import and export controls,\nintense competition, technological\ndevelopments and government regulation. Risk\nof Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector.\nCompanies in the consumer staples sector may\nbe adversely affected by changes in the global\neconomy, consumer spending, competition,\ndemographics and consumer preferences, and\nproduction spending. Companies in the consumer\nstaples sector may also be affected by changes\nin global economic, environmental and\npolitical events, economic conditions, the\ndepletion of resources, and government\nregulation. For instance, government\nregulations may affect the permissibility of\nusing various food additives and production\nmethods of companies that make food products,\nwhich could affect company profitability. In\naddition, tobacco companies may be adversely\naffected by the adoption of proposed\nlegislation and/or by litigation. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector also may be\nsubject to risks pertaining to the supply of,\ndemand for and prices of raw materials. The\nprices of raw materials fluctuate in response\nto a number of factors, including, without\nlimitation, changes in government agricultural\nsupport programs, exchange rates, import and\nexport controls, changes in international\nagricultural and trading policies, and\nseasonal and weather conditions. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector may be subject to\nsevere competition, which may also have an\nadverse impact on their profitability. Risk of\nInvesting in the Energy Sector. Companies in\nthe energy sector are strongly affected by the\nchanges in and volatility of global energy\nprices, energy supply and demand, government\nregulations and policies, energy production\nand conservation efforts, technological\nchange, development of alternative energy\nsources, and other factors that they cannot\ncontrol. Energy companies may have relatively\nhigh levels of debt and may be more likely to\nrestructure their businesses if there are\ndownturns in energy markets or in the global\neconomy. If an energy company in a Fund's\nportfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could\nlose all or a substantial portion of its\ninvestment. The energy sector is cyclical and\nis highly dependent on commodity prices.\nPrices and supplies of energy may fluctuate\nsignificantly over short and long periods of\ntime due to, among other things, national and\ninternational political changes, Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d )\npolicies, changes in relationships among OPEC\nmembers and between OPEC and oil-importing\nnations, the regulatory environment, taxation\npolicies, the enactment or cessation of trade\nsanctions, war or other geopolitical\nconflicts, and the economies of key energy-\nconsuming countries. Companies in the energy\nsector may be adversely affected by terrorism,\ncyber incidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to predict and depend on a number\nof factors. The effect of these events or any\nrelated developments could be significant and\nmay have a severe adverse effect on the\nperformance of a Fund.\n\n24\n\nRisk of Investing in the Financials Sector.\nCompanies in the financials sector include\nsmall, regional and money center banks,\nsecurities brokerage firms, asset management\ncompanies, savings banks and thrift\ninstitutions, specialty finance companies (\ne.g. , credit card, mortgage providers),\ninsurance and insurance brokerage firms,\nconsumer finance firms, financial\nconglomerates and foreign banking and\nfinancial companies. Most financial companies\nare subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which limits their activities and\nmay affect their ability to earn a profit from\na given line of business. Government\nregulation may change frequently and may have\nsignificant adverse consequences for companies\nin the financials sector, including effects\nnot intended by the regulation. Direct\ngovernmental intervention in the operations of\nfinancial companies and financial markets may\nmaterially and adversely affect the companies\nin which a Fund invests, including legislation\nin many countries that may increase government\nregulation, repatriation and other\nintervention. The impact of governmental\nintervention and legislative changes on any\nindividual financial company or on the\nfinancials sector as a whole cannot be\npredicted. The valuation of financial\ncompanies has been and continues to be subject\nto unprecedented volatility and may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors, including\ninterest rate risk and sovereign debt default.\nCertain financial businesses are subject to\nintense competitive pressures, including\nmarket share and price competition. Financial\ncompanies in foreign countries are subject to\nmarket-specific and general regulatory and\ninterest rate concerns. In particular,\ngovernment regulation in certain foreign\ncountries may include taxes and controls on\ninterest rates, credit availability, minimum\ncapital requirements, bans on short sales,\nlimits on prices and restrictions on currency\ntransfers. Market conditions and regulation of\nthe financial sector in China may be\nparticularly subject to change based on\ngovernment policy. In addition, companies in\nthe financials sector may be the targets of\nhacking and potential theft of proprietary or\ncustomer information or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a material adverse\neffect on their businesses. The profitability\nof banks, savings and loan associations and\nother financial companies is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change; for instance, when interest\nrates go up, the value of securities issued by\nmany types of companies in the financials\nsector generally goes down. In other words,\nfinancial companies may be adversely affected\nin certain market cycles, including, without\nlimitation, during periods of rising interest\nrates, which may restrict the availability and\nincrease the cost of capital, and during\nperiods of declining economic conditions,\nwhich may cause, among other things, credit\nlosses due to financial difficulties of\nborrowers. In addition, general economic\nconditions are important to the operations of\nthese companies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products. Patents have a limited\nduration, and, upon expiration, other\ncompanies may market substantially similar \u201c\ngeneric \u201d products that are typically sold at\na lower price than the patented product, which\ncan cause the original developer of the\nproduct to\n\n25\n\nlose market share and/or reduce the price\ncharged for the product, resulting in lower\nprofits for the original developer. As a\nresult, the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. In addition, because the products\nand services of many companies in the\nhealthcare sector affect the health and well-\nbeing of many individuals, these companies are\nespecially susceptible to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and similar claims.\nHealthcare companies are subject to\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Many new products in the\nhealthcare sector may be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of obtaining such\napprovals may be long and costly, which can\nresult in increased development costs, delayed\ncost recovery and loss of competitive\nadvantage to the extent that rival companies\nhave developed competing products or\nprocedures, adversely affecting the company\u2019s\nrevenues and profitability. In other words,\ndelays in the regulatory approval process may\ndiminish the opportunity for a company to\nprofit from a new product or to bring a new\nproduct to market, which could have a material\nadverse effect on a company\u2019s business.\nHealthcare companies may also be strongly\naffected by scientific biotechnology or\ntechnological developments, and their products\nmay quickly become obsolete. Also, many\nhealthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Industrials Sector. The value\nof securities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply of and demand for both their\nspecific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, companies in the industrials\nsector may be subject to liability for\nenvironmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Materials Sector.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control,\namong other factors. Such risks may adversely\naffect the issuers to which a Fund has\nexposure. Companies in the materials sector\nare also at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in the\nMedia Sub-Industry. Companies in the media\nsub-industry may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in formulating new products and\nservices using new technology. Media companies\nare subject to risks that include cyclicality\nof revenues and earnings, a potential decrease\nin the discretionary income of targeted\nindividuals, changing consumer tastes and\ninterests, competition in the industry and the\npotential for increased state and federal\nregulation. Advertising spending is an\nimportant source of revenue for media\ncompanies. During economic downturns,\nadvertising spending typically decreases and,\nas a result, media companies tend to generate\nless revenue. Risk of Investing in the Real\nEstate Industry. Companies in the real estate\nindustry include companies that invest in real\nestate, such as REITs, real estate holding and\noperating companies or real estate development\ncompanies (collectively, \u201c Real Estate\nCompanies \u201d ). Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies exposes investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly, as well\n\n26\n\nas to risks that relate specifically to the\nway in which Real Estate Companies are\norganized and operated. The real estate\nindustry is highly sensitive to general and\nlocal economic conditions and developments,\nand characterized by intense competition and\nperiodic overbuilding. Investing in Real\nEstate Companies involves various risks. Some\nrisks that are specific to Real Estate\nCompanies are discussed in greater detail\nbelow. Concentration Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may own a limited number of\nproperties and concentrate their investments\nin a particular geographic region or property\ntype. Economic downturns affecting a\nparticular region, industry or property type\nmay lead to a high volume of defaults within a\nshort period. Distressed Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may invest in distressed,\ndefaulted or out-of-favor bank loans.\nIdentification and implementation by a Real\nEstate Company of loan modification and\nrestructure programs involves a high degree of\nuncertainty. Even successful implementation\nmay still require adverse compromises and may\nnot prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies\nmay also invest in other debt instruments that\nmay become non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt or erratic\nprice fluctuations. In addition, real estate\nis relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other capital\nexpenditures, the income and ability of a Real\nEstate Company to make payments of any\ninterest and principal on its debt securities\nwill be adversely affected. Loan Foreclosure\nRisk. Real Estate Companies may foreclose on\nloans that the Real Estate Company originated\nand/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate\nnegative publicity for the underlying property\nthat affects its market value. In addition to\nthe length and expense of such proceedings,\nthe validity of the terms of the applicable\nloan may not be recognized in foreclosure\nproceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by\nborrowers or other lenders may interfere with\nthe enforcement of rights by a Real Estate\nCompany. Parallel proceedings, such as\nbankruptcy, may also delay resolution and\nlimit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed\nloan by a Real Estate Company even where the\nproperty underlying the loan is liquidated.\nManagement Risk. Real Estate Companies are\ndependent upon management skills and may have\nlimited financial resources. Real Estate\nCompanies are generally not diversified and\nmay be subject to heavy cash flow dependency,\ndefault by borrowers and voluntary\nliquidation. In addition, transactions between\nReal Estate Companies and their affiliates may\nbe subject to conflicts of interest, which may\nadversely affect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\nshareholders. A Real Estate Company may also\nhave joint venture investments in certain of\nits properties, and, consequently, its ability\nto control decisions relating to such\nproperties may be limited. Property Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may be subject to risks\nrelating to functional obsolescence or reduced\ndesirability of properties; extended vacancies\ndue to economic conditions and tenant\nbankruptcies; catastrophic events such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts;\nand casualty or condemnation losses. Real\nestate income and values also may be greatly\naffected by demographic trends, such as\npopulation shifts or changes in consumer\npreferences and values, or increasing\nvacancies or declining rents resulting from\nlegal, cultural, technological, global or\nlocal economic developments.\n\n27\n\nRegulatory Risk. Real estate income and values\nmay be adversely affected by such factors as\napplicable domestic and foreign laws\n(including tax laws). Government actions, such\nas tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other commercial restrictions or\nenvironmental regulations, also may have a\nmajor impact on real estate income and values.\nIn addition, quarterly compliance with\nregulations limiting the proportion of asset\ntypes held by a U.S. REIT may force certain\nReal Estate Companies to liquidate or\nrestructure otherwise attractive investments.\nSome countries may not recognize REITs or\ncomparable structures as a viable form of real\nestate funds. Underlying Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies make investments in a variety\nof debt and equity instruments with varying\nrisk profiles. For instance, Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in debt instruments\nsecured by commercial property that have\nhigher risks of delinquency and foreclosure\nthan loans on single family homes due to a\nvariety of factors associated with commercial\nproperty, including the tie between income\navailable to service debt and productive use\nof the property. Real Estate Companies may\nalso invest in debt instruments and preferred\nequity that are junior in an issuer\u2019s capital\nstructure and that involve privately\nnegotiated structures. Subordinated debt\ninvestments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine\nloans, involve a greater credit risk of\ndefault due to the need to service more senior\ndebt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred\nequity investments involve a greater risk of\nloss than conventional debt financing due to\ntheir non-collateralized nature and\nsubordinated ranking. Investments in\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities may also\nbe junior in priority in the event of\nbankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments\nin senior loans may be effectively\nsubordinated if the senior loan is pledged as\ncollateral. The ability of a holder of junior\nclaims to proceed against a defaulting issuer\nis circumscribed by the terms of the\nparticular contractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nA REIT that successfully maintains its\nqualification may still become subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes, including\nexcise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage\nrecording, and transfer taxes, both directly\nand indirectly through its subsidiaries.\nBecause REITs often do not provide complete\ntax information until after the calendar year-\nend, a Fund may at times need to request\npermission to extend the deadline for issuing\nyour tax reporting statement or supplement the\ninformation otherwise provided to you. Risk of\nInvesting in Technology Companies. Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources\nand personnel. These companies may face rapid\nproduct obsolescence as well as unexpected\nrisks and costs related to new product\nintroduction and technological developments,\nsuch as artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning. Technology companies may be\nadversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs. Risk of Investing in\nthe Telecommunications Sector. The\ntelecommunications sector of a country\u2019s\neconomy is often subject to extensive\ngovernment regulation. The costs of complying\nwith governmental regulations, delays or\nfailure to receive required regulatory\napprovals, or the enactment of new regulatory\nrequirements may negatively affect the\nbusiness of telecommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the\ntelecommunications sector may experience\ndistressed cash flows due to the need to\ncommit substantial capital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may make the\nproducts and services of certain\ntelecommunications companies obsolete.\nFinally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the telecommunications\nsector may be particular targets of hacking\nand potential theft of proprietary or consumer\ninformation or disruptions in service, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on their\nbusinesses. Risk of Investing in the Utilities\nSector. The utilities sector may be adversely\naffected by changing commodity prices,\ngovernment regulation stipulating rates\ncharged by utilities, increased tariffs,\nchanges in tax laws, interest rate\nfluctuations and changes in the cost of\nproviding specific utility services. The\nutilities industry is also subject to\npotential terrorist attacks, natural disasters\nand severe weather conditions, as well as\nregulatory and operational burdens associated\nwith the operation\n\n28\n\nand maintenance of nuclear facilities.\nGovernment regulators monitor and control\nutility revenues and costs, and therefore may\nlimit utility profits. Federal legislation may\nfacilitate the construction of electric\ntransmission lines not only by public\nutilities but also by independent transmission\ndevelopers, which could increase competition\nin the wholesale electricity markets. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate\nnuclear generating facilities. Governmental\nauthorities may from time to time review\nexisting policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policy For the Funds, the Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for each\nFund\u2019s securities to BFA pursuant to the\nFunds' Proxy Voting Policy, and BFA has\nadopted policies and procedures (collectively,\nthe \u201c iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d )\ngoverning proxy voting by accounts managed by\nBFA, including the Funds. Under the iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote\nproxies related to Fund securities in the best\ninterests of a Fund and its shareholders. From\ntime to time, a vote may present a conflict\nbetween the interests of a Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, on the one hand, and those of\nBFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or\nBFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and\nprocedures that are designed to prevent undue\ninfluence on BFA\u2019s proxy voting activity that\nmight stem from any relationship between the\nissuer of a proxy (or any dissident\nshareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s affiliates, a Fund\nor a Fund\u2019s affiliates. Most conflicts are\nmanaged through a structural separation of\nBFA\u2019s Corporate Governance Group from BFA\u2019s\nemployees with sales and client\nresponsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains\nprocedures to ensure that all engagements with\ncorporate issuers or dissident shareholders\nare managed consistently and without regard to\nBFA\u2019s relationship with the issuer of the\nproxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Funds' portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ended\nJune 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon\nrequest, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' website\nat www.blackrock.com/proxyrecords; and (ii) on\nthe SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov. Portfolio\nHoldings Information On each Business Day (as\ndefined in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI), prior to\nthe opening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on\nits website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of a Fund\u2019s next net\nasset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties:\n\n29\n\n\u2022 Communications of Data Files: A Fund may\nmake available through the facilities of the\nNational Securities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c\nNSCC \u201d ) or through posting on the\nwww.iShares.com , prior to the opening of\ntrading on each business day, a list of a\nFund\u2019s holdings (generally pro-rata) that\nAuthorized Participants could deliver to a\nFund to settle purchases of a Fund ( i.e.\nDeposit Securities) or that Authorized\nParticipants would receive from a Fund to\nsettle redemptions of a Fund ( i.e. Fund\nSecurities). These files are known as the\nPortfolio Composition File and the Fund Data\nFile (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The Files are\napplicable for the next trading day and are\nprovided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an Authorized Participant or liquidity\nprovider the securities a Fund is willing to\naccept for a creation, and securities that a\nFund will provide on a redemption. BFA\nemployees may also discuss portfolio holdings-\nrelated information with broker/dealers, in\nconnection with settling a Fund\u2019s\ntransactions, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with the disclosure in the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent registration statement. \u2022\nCommunications with Listing Exchanges: From\ntime to time, employees of BFA may discuss\nportfolio holdings information with the\napplicable primary listing exchange for a Fund\nas needed to meet the exchange listing\nstandards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFunds, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Funds, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain a Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of a Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio- level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nConstruction and Maintenance of the Underlying\nIndexes Descriptions of the Underlying Indexes\nare provided below. With respect to certain\nunderlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA\nor its affiliates have held discussions with\nthe applicable index provider regarding their\nbusiness interest in licensing an index to\ntrack a particular market segment and conveyed\ninvestment concepts and strategies that could\nbe considered for the index. The index\nprovider designed and constituted such indices\nusing concepts conveyed by BFA or its\naffiliates. For certain of these indices, the\nrelevant fund may be the first or sole\n\n30\n\nuser of the underlying index. In its sole\ndiscretion, the index provider determines the\ncomposition of the securities and other\ninstruments in such underlying index, the\nrebalance protocols of the underlying index,\nthe weightings of the securities and other\ninstruments in the underlying index, and any\nupdates to the methodology. From time to time,\nBFA or its affiliates may also provide input\nrelating to possible methodology changes of\nsuch underlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\nThe FTSE Global Equity Index Series FTSE China\n50 Index Number of Components: 50 Index\nDescription. The FTSE China 50 is designed to\ntrack the performance of the largest companies\nin the Chinese equity market that are\navailable to international investors. The\nUnderlying Index consists of 50 of the largest\nand most liquid Chinese companies. The\nsecurities in the Underlying Index are\nweighted based on the total market value of\ntheir shares. The Underlying Index\nconstituents are screened for liquidity and\nindividual constituent weights are capped at\n9% to avoid over-concentration in any one\nstock. Additionally, constituents are capped\nsuch that all companies that individually have\na weight greater than 4.5% in aggregate\nrepresent no more than 38% of the Underlying\nIndex. As of July 31, 2024, the Underlying\nIndex consists of \u201c Red Chip \u201d shares, \u201c H \u201d\nshares and \u201c P Chip \u201d shares. H Shares:\nSecurities of companies incorporated in the\nPRC and nominated by the Central Government\nfor listing and trading on the Stock Exchange\nof Hong Kong. Specifically, they are the\nforeign shares of a PRC issuer which are\nlisted on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Red\nChips: FTSE International Limited ( \u201c FTSE \u201d )\ndefines Red Chips as companies incorporated\noutside the PRC that trade on the Stock\nExchange of Hong Kong which are substantially\nowned, directly or indirectly, by Mainland\nChina state entities and with the majority of\nrevenue or assets derived from Mainland China.\nP Chips: FTSE defines P Chips as companies\ncontrolled by Mainland individuals, with the\nestablishment and origin of the company in\nMainland China. P Chips must be incorporated\noutside of the PRC and traded on the Stock\nExchange of Hong Kong with a majority of\nrevenues or assets derived from Mainland\nChina. Component Selection Criteria. The\nUnderlying Index is primarily rule-based, but\nis also monitored by a governing committee.\nThe Secretary to the Underlying Index is\nresponsible for conducting a quarterly review\nof constituents for the Underlying Index and\nfor recommending to the governing committee\nany constituents to be inserted or deleted as\npart of the quarterly review. All eligible\nsecurities are ranked by their full market\ncapitalizations. Eligibility. Each security\nincluded in the Underlying Index is a current\nconstituent of the FTSE All-World Index, an\nindex of the FTSE Global Equity Index Series.\nAll classes of equity securities in issue are\neligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index\nsubject to conforming with free-float and\nliquidity restrictions. Liquidity. Stocks are\nscreened to ensure there is sufficient\nliquidity to be traded. Factors in determining\nliquidity include the availability of current\nand reliable price information and the level\nof trading volume relative to shares\noutstanding. Value traded and float turnover\nare also analyzed on a monthly basis to review\nliquidity. Index Maintenance and Issue\nChanges. The FTSE Global Classification\nCommittee is responsible for the industry\nclassification of constituents of the\nUnderlying Index within the FTSE Global\nClassification System. The FTSE Global\nClassification Committee may approve changes\nto the FTSE Global Classification System and\nManagement Rules. FTSE appoints the Chairman\nand Deputy Chairman of the Underlying Index.\nThe Chairman, or in his absence Deputy\nChairman, will chair meetings of the Committee\nand will represent that Committee outside\nmeetings. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of\nthe Index Committee are collectively\nresponsible for approving constituent changes\nto the Underlying Index between meetings of\nthe Committee on advice from the Secretary to\nthe Committee and as permitted and as\nspecified by the Underlying Index's Ground\nRules. Additions. A company is added to the\nUnderlying Index at the periodic review if it\nrises to the 40th position or above when the\neligible companies are ranked by full market\nvalue before the application of any\ninvestability weightings.\n\n31\n\nDeletions. A company in the Underlying Index\nis deleted at the periodic review if it falls\nto the 61st position or below when the\neligible companies are ranked by full market\nvalue before the application of any\ninvestability weighting. Any deletion to the\nUnderlying Index will simultaneously entail an\naddition to the Underlying Index in order to\nmaintain 50 Index constituents at all times.\nRevisions to the Float Adjustments. The\nUnderlying Index is reviewed quarterly for\nchanges in free float. These reviews coincide\nwith quarterly reviews undertaken of the\nUnderlying Index. Implementation of any\nchanges takes place after the close of the\nUnderlying Index calculation on the third\nFriday in March, June, September and December.\nQuarterly Index Rebalancing. The quarterly\nreview of the Underlying Index constituents\ntakes place in March, June, September and\nDecember. Any constituent changes are\nimplemented on the next trading day following\nthe third Friday of the same month of the\nreview meeting. Details of the outcome of the\nreview and the dates on which any changes are\nto be implemented are published as soon as\npossible after the Index Committee meeting has\nconcluded. Significant Underlying Index\nrebalancing may cause funds based on the\nUnderlying Index to experience trading error.\nIndex Availability. The Underlying Index is\ncalculated continuously during Hong Kong\ntrading hours and is widely disseminated to\nmajor data vendors. The Underlying Index will\nnot be calculated on Hong Kong public\nholidays. Exchange Rates and Pricing. The\nUnderlying Index uses Reuters' real-time\nforeign exchange spot rates and Reuters' real-\ntime security prices. The Underlying Index is\ncalculated in Hong Kong Dollars. Non-Hong Kong\nDollar denominated constituent prices are\nconverted to Hong Kong Dollars in order to\ncalculate the Underlying Index. The foreign\nexchange rates and security prices received\nfrom Reuters at the closing time of the\nUnderlying Index are used to calculate the\nfinal index levels. The MSCI Indexes The MSCI\nindexes were founded in 1969 by Capital\nInternational S.A. as international\nperformance benchmarks constructed to\nfacilitate comparison of world markets. The\nMSCI single country standard equity indexes\nhave covered the world's developed markets\nsince 1969 and in 1987 MSCI commenced coverage\nof emerging markets. Local stock exchanges\ntraditionally calculated their own indexes,\nwhich were generally not comparable with one\nanother due to differences in the\nrepresentation of the local market,\nmathematical formulas, base dates and methods\nof adjusting for capital changes. MSCI,\nhowever, applies the same calculation\nmethodology to all markets for all single\ncountry standard equity indexes, both\ndeveloped and emerging. MSCI Global Investable\nMarket Indexes MSCI's Global Investable Market\nIndexes (the \u201c MSCI GIMI \u201d ) provide coverage\nand non-overlapping market segmentation by\nmarket capitalization size and by style. The\nMSCI GIMI intend to target approximately 99%\ncoverage of the free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization in each market of large-, mid-\nand small-cap securities. In each market, MSCI\ncreates an Investable Market Index, Standard\nIndex, Large Cap Index, Mid Cap Index and\nSmall Cap Index. The Standard Index, Large Cap\nIndex, Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index are\neach subsets of the Investable Market Index\nfor a market. The MSCI Global Standard Index\nis the aggregation of the Large Cap Index and\nMid Cap Index and the MSCI GIMI is the\naggregation of the MSCI Global Standard Index\nand MSCI Global Small Cap Index. Selection\nCriteria. MSCI's index construction process\ninvolves: (i) defining the equity universe;\n(ii) determining the market investable equity\nuniverse for each market; (iii) determining\nmarket capitalization size segments for each\nmarket; (iv) applying final size segment\ninvestability requirements; and (v) applying\nindex continuity rules for the MSCI Global\nStandard Index. Defining the Equity Universe .\nMSCI begins with securities listed in\ncountries in the MSCI GIMI. As of August 2024,\n23 are classified as developed markets, 24 as\nemerging markets, and 27 as frontier markets.\nAll listed equity securities and listed\nsecurities that exhibit characteristics of\nequity securities, except mutual funds, ETFs,\nequity derivatives, limited partnerships and\nmost investment trusts, are eligible for\ninclusion in the equity universe. REITs in\nsome countries and certain income trusts in\nCanada are also eligible for inclusion. Each\ncompany and its securities ( i.e ., share\nclasses) are classified in only one country.\n\n32\n\nDetermining the Market Investable Equity\nUniverse for Each Market. The equity universe\nin any market is derived by applying\ninvestability screens to individual companies\nand securities in that market. Some\ninvestability requirements are applied at the\nindividual security level and some at the\noverall company level, represented by the\naggregation of individual securities of the\ncompany. As a result, the inclusion or\nexclusion of one security does not imply the\nautomatic inclusion or exclusion of other\nsecurities of the same company. Determining\nMarket Capitalization Size Segments for Each\nMarket. In order to create size components\nthat can be meaningfully aggregated into\ncomposites, individual market size segments\nbalance the following two objectives: \u2022\nAchieving global size integrity by ensuring\nthat companies of comparable and relevant\nsizes are included in a given size segment\nacross all markets in a composite index; and \u2022\nAchieving consistent market coverage by\nensuring that each market's size segment is\nrepresented in its proportional weight in the\ncomposite universe. The Standard Indexes,\nLarge Cap Indexes, Mid Cap Indexes, and Small\nCap Indexes capture the following market\ncapitalization size segments: \u2022 MSCI Global\nStandard Indexes cover all investable large-\nand mid-cap securities by including the\nlargest issuers comprising approximately 85%\nof each market\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. \u2022 MSCI Global Large Cap\nIndexes provide coverage of all investable\nlarge-cap securities by including the largest\nissuers comprising approximately 70% of each\nmarket\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. \u2022 MSCI Global Mid Cap Indexes\nprovide coverage in each market by deriving\nthe difference between the market coverage of\nthe MSCI Global Standard Index and the MSCI\nGlobal Large Cap Index in that market. \u2022 MSCI\nGlobal Small Cap Indexes provide coverage of\ncompanies with a market capitalization below\nthat of the companies in the MSCI Global\nStandard Indexes. Applying Final Size Segment\nInvestability Requirements. In order to\nenhance replicability of the indexes,\nadditional size segment investability\nrequirements are set for the MSCI GIMI and\nMSCI Global Standard Index. These\ninvestability requirements include minimum\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization,\nminimum liquidity, minimum foreign limits and\nminimum length of trading. Applying Index\nContinuity Rules for the Standard Index. In\norder to achieve index continuity as well as\nprovide some basic level of diversification\nwithin a market index, notwithstanding the\neffect of other index construction rules\ncontained herein, a minimum number of five\nconstituents will be maintained for a\ndeveloped market Standard Index and a minimum\nnumber of three constituents will be\nmaintained for an emerging market Standard\nIndex. Weighting. All indexes of the MSCI GIMI\nare free float weighted, i.e., companies are\nincluded in the indexes at the value of their\nfree public float (free float multiplied by\nsecurity price). Regional Weights. Market\ncapitalization-weighting, combined with a\nconsistent target of approximately 99% of free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization, helps\nensure that each country's weight in regional\nand international indexes approximates its\nweight in the total universe of developing and\nemerging markets. A market is equivalent to a\nsingle country except for developed Europe,\nwhere all markets are aggregated into a single\nmarket for index construction purposes.\nIndividual country indexes of the European\ndeveloped markets are derived from the\nconstituents of the MSCI GIMI Europe Index.\nFree Float. MSCI defines the free float of a\nsecurity as the proportion of shares\noutstanding that are deemed to be available\nfor purchase in the public equity markets by\ninternational investors. In practice,\nlimitations on free float available to\ninternational investors include: (i) strategic\nand other shareholdings not considered part of\navailable free float; and (ii) limits on share\nownership for foreigners. MSCI calculates the\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization of\neach security in the equity index universe by\n(i) defining and estimating the free float\navailable to foreign investors; (ii) assigning\na free float-adjustment factor to each\nsecurity; and (iii) calculating the free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of each\nsecurity. Under MSCI's free float-adjustment\nmethodology, a constituent's inclusion factor\nis equal to its estimated free float, rounded\nup to the closest 5% for constituents with\nfree float equal to or exceeding 15%. For\nexample, a constituent security with a\n\n33\n\nfree float of 23.2% will be included in the\nindex at 25% of its market capitalization. For\nsecurities with a free float of less than 15%,\nthe estimated free float is adjusted to the\nnearest 1%. Price and Exchange Rates Prices.\nThe prices used to calculate all MSCI indexes\nare the official exchange closing prices or\nthose figures accepted as such. MSCI reserves\nthe right to use an alternative pricing source\non any given day. Exchange Rates. MSCI uses\nthe World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates\ntaken at 4:00 p.m. London time. In case World\nMarkets/Reuters does not provide rates for\nspecific markets on given days (for example,\nChristmas Day and New Year's Day), the\nprevious business day's rates are normally\nused. MSCI independently monitors the exchange\nrates on all its indexes. MSCI may under\nexceptional circumstances elect to use\nalternative sources of exchange rates if the\nWorld Markets/Reuters rates are not available,\nor if MSCI determines that the World\nMarkets/Reuters rates are not reflective of\nmarket circumstances for a given currency on a\nparticular day. In such circumstances, an\nannouncement would be sent to clients with the\nrelated information. If appropriate, MSCI may\nconduct a consultation with the investment\ncommunity to gather feedback on the most\nrelevant exchange rate. Changes to the\nIndexes. The MSCI GIMI are maintained with the\nobjective of reflecting, on a timely basis,\nthe evolution of the underlying equity\nmarkets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes,\nemphasis is also placed on continuity,\nreplicability and minimizing turnover in the\nindexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves\nmany aspects, including: (i) additions to, and\ndeletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in\nnumber of shares; and (iii) changes in\ninclusion factors as a result of updated free\nfloat estimates. Index maintenance can be\ndescribed by three broad categories of\nchanges: \u2022 Semi-Annual Index Reviews ( \u201c SAIRs\n\u201d ), conducted on a fixed semi-annual\ntimetable that systematically reassess the\nvarious dimensions of the equity universe for\nall markets; \u2022 Quarterly Index Reviews ( \u201c\nQIRs \u201d ), aimed at promptly reflecting other\nsignificant market events; and \u2022 Ongoing\nevent-related changes, such as mergers,\nacquisitions, spin-offs, bankruptcies,\nreorganizations and other similar corporate\nevents, which generally are implemented in the\nindexes as they occur. Potential changes in\nthe status of countries (stand-alone,\nfrontier, emerging and developed) follow their\nown implementation time tables. In addition,\nreviews of company involvement in ESG\ncontroversies, when applicable, may differ by\nindex and severity of the ESG controversy as\ndetermined by MSCI. MSCI conducts SAIRs\ngenerally as of the close of the last business\nday of May and November. During the SAIRs,\nMSCI updates the investable equity universe\nand reassesses size segmentation investability\nrequirements. MSCI also conducts QIRs\ngenerally as of the close of the last business\nday of February and August. During the QIRs,\nMSCI reflects changes in the index that were\nnot captured at the time of their actual\noccurrence, but are significant enough to be\nincluded before the next SAIR. The results of\nthe SAIR and QIR are generally announced at\nleast ten business days in advance of\nimplementation. Creation of Sector and\nIndustry Indexes using the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) All\nsecurities in the Global Investable Equity\nUniverse are assigned to the industry that\nbest describes their business activities using\nthe GICS. The GICS consists of sectors,\nindustry groups, industries and sub-\nindustries. Under the GICS, each company is\nassigned to one unique sub-industry according\nto its principal business activity (generally\ndefined as the business activity that\ngenerates 60% or more of the company\u2019s\nrevenues). Narrower indexes may be derived\nbased on industry classification, and may\ncontain securities belonging to specific\nsectors, industry groups, industries, sub-\nindustries or a combination thereof. MSCI\n25/50 Indexes Each of the MSCI 25/50 Indexes\n(the \u201c 25/50 Indexes \u201d ) is a sub-index of\neither an MSCI Global Standard Index or an\nMSCI GIMI. Their construction reflects the\ndiversification requirements applicable to\nRICs pursuant to Subchapter M of the Internal\nRevenue Code. MSCI uses the concept of \u201c group\nentities \u201d for the concentration limits of the\ncapping methodologies in the 25/50 Indexes. A\ngroup entity is a group of companies that\noperate as an affiliated corporate group but\nmay separately issue listed securities. To\ndetermine \u201c group entities, \u201d MSCI analyzes\nfinancial accounts of listed companies holding\nstakes of 20% or more in other listed\ncompanies to determine whether these stakes\nare controlling in nature. In certain cases,\neven in the absence of consolidated accounts,\nMSCI may also consider two companies as\nbelonging to the same group entity where\n\n34\n\nthere is reasonable evidence of control based\non other information. The 25/50 Indexes are\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization-\nweighted indexes with a capping methodology\napplied to group entity weights so that no\nsingle group entity exceeds 25% of index\nweight, and all group entities with a weight\nabove 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the\nindex weight. A buffer of 10% of the value of\neach of these caps is used in order to reduce\nthe risk of noncompliance due to short term\nmarket movements between rebalances. As a\nresult, at the point of constructing or\nrebalancing the 25/50 Indexes, the weight of\nany single group entity cannot exceed 22.5% of\nthe index weight and all group entities with\nweight above 4.5% cannot exceed 45% of the\nindex weight. A software application called\nthe Barra Optimizer is utilized to calculate\nthe capped index weights through an\noptimization function which is aimed at\nminimizing index turnover, tracking error and\nextreme deviation from the uncapped index.\nMSCI EAFE Growth Index Number of Components:\napproximately 369 Index Description. The MSCI\nEAFE Growth Index is an MSCI Global Standard\nIndex. The Underlying Index is a subset of the\nMSCI EAFE Index and constituents of the\nUnderlying Index include securities from\nEurope, Australasia and the Far East. The\nUnderlying Index generally represents\napproximately 50% of the free float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization of the MSCI EAFE Index\nand consists of those securities classified by\nMSCI as most representing the growth style.\nSecurities classified in this style generally\ntend to have higher growth characteristics (\ni.e. , higher long-term forward earnings-per-\nshare ( \u201c EPS \u201d ) growth rate, short-term\nforward EPS growth rate, current internal\ngrowth rate and long-term historical EPS\ngrowth trend and long-term historical sales\nper share growth trend). MSCI uses a\nspecialized framework to attribute both growth\nand value style characteristics to each\nsecurity within the MSCI EAFE Index. Each\nsecurity is evaluated based on certain value\nfactors and growth factors, which are then\nused to calculate a growth score and value\nscore. Based upon these two scores, MSCI\ndetermines the extent to which each security\nis assigned to the growth or value style. It\nis possible for a single security to have\nrepresentation in both the growth and value\nstyle indexes, however, no more than 100% of a\nsecurity\u2019s float-adjusted market\ncapitalization will be included within the\ncombined style framework. Calculation\nMethodology. The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. MSCI EAFE Index\nNumber of Components: approximately 741 Index\nDescription. The MSCI EAFE Index is an MSCI\nGlobal Standard Index. The Underlying Index is\ncommonly used as a measure of international\nstock performance. Constituents of the\nUnderlying Index include securities from\nEurope, Australasia and the Far East.\nCalculation Methodology. The Fund utilizes the\nUnderlying Index calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. MSCI EAFE\nMinimum Volatility (USD) Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 236 Index\nDescription. The MSCI EAFE Minimum Volatility\n(USD) Index is an MSCI Global Standard Index.\nThe Underlying Index measures the performance\nof international equity securities from\nEurope, Australasia, the Middle East and the\nFar East that, in the aggregate, have lower\nrelative volatility. Each security included in\nthe Underlying Index is a current constituent\nof the MSCI EAFE Index. Calculation\nMethodology. The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating\n\n35\n\nthe net dividends. The regular cash dividend\nis reinvested after deduction of withholding\ntax by applying the maximum rate of the\ncompany\u2019s country of incorporation applicable\nto institutional investors. Net dividends\nmeans dividends after taxes withheld at the\nrate applicable to non-resident institutional\ninvestors who do not benefit from double\ntaxation treaties. Such withholding rates may\ndiffer from those applicable to U.S.\nresidents. MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 2,112 The MSCI EAFE\nSmall Cap Index is an MSCI Global Small Cap\nIndex. The Underlying Index represents the\nsmall-cap universe ( i.e. , listed securities\nwith a market capitalization in the range of\n$81 million - $9 billion) of the MSCI EAFE IMI\nIndex, and consists of the securities of those\ncompanies whose securities are included in the\nMSCI GIMI but not the MSCI Global Standard\nIndex in a particular market. Calculation\nMethodology. The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. MSCI EAFE Value\nIndex Number of Components: approximately 467\nIndex Description. The MSCI EAFE Value Index\nis an MSCI Global Standard Index. The\nUnderlying Index is a subset of the MSCI EAFE\nIndex and constituents of the Underlying Index\ninclude securities from Europe, Australasia\nand the Far East. The Underlying Index targets\napproximately 50% coverage of the free float-\nadjusted market capitalization of the MSCI\nEAFE Index and consists of those securities\nclassified by MSCI as most representing the\nvalue style. Securities classified in this\nstyle generally tend to have higher value\ncharacteristics ( i.e. , higher book value to\nprice, 12-month forward earnings to price and\ndividend yield). Each security is evaluated\nbased on certain value factors and growth\nfactors, which are then used to calculate a\ngrowth score and value score. Based upon these\ntwo scores, MSCI determines the extent to\nwhich each security is assigned to the value\nor growth style. It is possible for a single\nsecurity to have representation in both the\nvalue and growth style indexes; however, no\nmore than 100% of a security\u2019s float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization will be included within\nthe combined style framework. Calculation\nMethodology. The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. MSCI Europe\nFinancials Index Number of Components:\napproximately 80 Index Description. The MSCI\nEurope Financials Index is an MSCI Global\nStandard Index. The Underlying Index is a free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization-weighted\nindex designed to measure the combined equity\nmarket performance of the financials sector of\ndeveloped market countries in Europe.\nCalculation Methodology. The Fund utilizes the\nUnderlying Index calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. MSCI Europe\nSmall Cap Index\n\n36\n\nNumber of Components: approximately 879 Index\nDescription. The MSCI Europe Small Cap Index\nis an MSCI Global Small Cap Index. The\nUnderlying Index is a free float-adjusted,\nmarket capitalization-weighted index that\ncaptures small-cap representation across the\n15 developed market countries in Europe. The\nIndex covers approximately 14% of the free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization in the\nEuropean equity universe. As of July 31, 2024,\nthe Index consisted of securities from the\nfollowing countries or regions: Austria,\nBelgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,\nIreland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,\nPortugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the\nU.K. Calculation Methodology. The Fund\nutilizes the Underlying Index calculated with\nnet dividends reinvested. MSCI uses the index\nconstituent companies\u2019 country of\nincorporation to determine the relevant\ndividend withholding tax rates in calculating\nthe net dividends. The regular cash dividend\nis reinvested after deduction of withholding\ntax by applying the maximum rate of the\ncompany\u2019s country of incorporation applicable\nto institutional investors. Net dividends\nmeans dividends after taxes withheld at the\nrate applicable to non-resident institutional\ninvestors who do not benefit from double\ntaxation treaties. Such withholding rates may\ndiffer from those applicable to U.S.\nresidents. MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index\nNumber of Components: approximately 150 Index\nDescription. The MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index\nis an MSCI Global Standard Index. The\nUnderlying Index is based on a traditional\nmarket capitalization-weighted parent index,\nthe MSCI USA Index, which includes U.S. large-\nand mid- capitalization stocks. The Underlying\nIndex is designed to measure the performance\nof securities in the parent index that exhibit\nhigher value characteristics relative to their\npeers within the corresponding Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) sector. To\nconstruct the Underlying Index, the index\nprovider determines the value weighting of\neach security in the parent index using three\nvariables: price-to-book value, price-to-\nforward earnings and enterprise value-to-cash\nflow from operations. MSCI uses an algorithm\nto determine the number of components in the\nUnderlying Index based on the number of\nconstituents in the Parent Index. The number\nof components is evaluated semi-annually. MSCI\nassigns weights by multiplying a component's\nvalue score by its market capitalization.\nWeights in the Underlying Index are next\nnormalized so that sectors in the Underlying\nIndex represent the same weight as in the\nparent index. Calculation Methodology. The\nFund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated\nwith gross dividends reinvested. The use of\ngross dividends reflects the assumed\nreinvestment of the entire dividend\ndistributed to holders of the underlying\nstock, without any adjustment for taxes or\nwithholding. MSCI USA Low Size Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 601 Index\nDescription. The MSCI USA Low Size Index is an\nMSCI Global Standard Index. As of July 31,\n2024, the MSCI USA Low Size Index is based on\na traditional market capitalization-weighted\nparent index, the MSCI USA Index, which\nincludes U.S. large- and mid-capitalization\nstocks. The Underlying Index is constructed by\napplying a mathematical formula at each\nrebalancing that reweights the components of\nits market capitalization-weighted Parent\nIndex, such that the representation of smaller\ncapitalization companies is increased relative\nto larger capitalization companies. In\naddition, at each rebalancing, the Index\nProvider calculates a \u201c constraint factor \u201d\nfor each component. The constraint factor is\nthe ratio of the component\u2019s weight in the\nUnderlying Index to that component\u2019s weight in\nthe Parent Index. The constraint factor is\nheld constant between each rebalancing, except\nin the case of corporate events (as defined by\nthe Index Provider). Changes in the relative\nweight of an individual component in the\nParent Index due to market\nappreciation/depreciation result in that\ncomponent increasing/decreasing in weight in\nthe Underlying Index to hold the constraint\nfactor for that component constant between\neach rebalancing. The Underlying Index is\nrebalanced semiannually in May and November.\nCalculation Methodology. The Fund utilizes the\nUnderlying Index calculated with gross\ndividends reinvested. The use of gross\ndividends reflects the assumed reinvestment of\nthe entire dividend distributed to holders of\nthe underlying stock, without any adjustment\nfor taxes or withholding. MSCI USA Minimum\nVolatility Extended ESG Reduced Carbon Target\nIndex Number of Components: approximately 151\n\n37\n\nIndex Description. The MSCI USA Minimum\nVolatility Extended ESG Reduced Carbon Target\nIndex is designed to maximize its exposure to\nfavorable environmental, social, and\ngovernance ( \u201c ESG \u201d ) characteristics (as\ndefined by the Index Provider) while\nreflecting the performance of a minimum\nvolatility strategy, as well as reducing\ncarbon exposure and improving weighted-\naverage, industry-adjusted ESG scores relative\nto the MSCI USA Index. Index Methodology. The\nIndex Provider begins with the MSCI USA Index\nand excludes securities of issuers that it\nidentifies as being involved in any of the\nbusiness activities summarized below: \u2022\nCompanies that meet the Index Provider's\ndetermination of \u201c tobacco involvement, \u201d\nincluding companies classified as a producer\nor licensor, companies that own or are owned\nby a tobacco company, and companies that earn\n15% or more of their revenue from tobacco\nproducts. \u2022 Companies with any tie to\ncontroversial weapons (as defined by the Index\nProvider). \u2022 Companies classified as a\nproducer of civilian firearms (as defined by\nthe Index Provider) as well as companies\nclassified as retailers of civilian firearms\nif such retailers earn 5% or more, or more\nthan $20 million, in revenue from civilian\nfirearms-related products. \u2022 Companies that\nderive 5% or more in revenue from the mining\nor sales to external parties of thermal coal\n(excluding metallurgical coal) or from thermal\ncoal-based power generation (as defined by the\nIndex Provider). \u2022 Companies that own oil\nsands reserves and derive more than 5% in\nrevenue from oil sands extraction. The Index\nProvider also excludes companies involved in\nvery severe business controversies, defined as\nan instance or ongoing situation in which\ncompany operations and/or products allegedly\nhave a negative ESG impact, including alleged\nviolations of laws, regulations, or accepted\ninternational norms ( e.g ., human rights\nviolations or toxic emissions and waste). In\neach case, severe business controversies are\ndetermined by the Index Provider based on an\nMSCI ESG Controversy Score. The Index Provider\nalso excludes companies that are not assessed\nby the Index Provider to determine their\ninvolvement in severe business controversies\nor their management of ESG risks and\nopportunities ( \u201c ESG Score, \u201d in each case\ndetermined by the Index Provider). For ESG\nscoring, the Index Provider identifies, for\neach industry, key ESG issues that may\ngenerate unanticipated costs for a given\ncompany or industry (as determined by the\nIndex Provider). The Index Provider has\nidentified 35 key ESG issues across the\nfollowing 10 themes: climate change, natural\ncapital, pollution and waste, environmental\nopportunities, human capital, product\nliability, stakeholder opposition, social\nopportunities, corporate governance and\ncorporate behavior. The Index Provider then\ncalculates the size of each company\u2019s exposure\nto each key issue based on the company\u2019s\nbusiness segment and geographic risk and\nanalyzes the extent to which the company has\ndeveloped robust strategies and programs to\nmanage ESG risks and opportunities. Using a\nsector-specific weighting model, companies are\nrated and ranked in comparison to their\nindustry peers. A higher rating indicates that\na company exhibits more favorable ESG\ncharacteristics and greater resilience to\nlong-term, material ESG risks specific to that\nindustry. The Index Provider then follows a\nquantitative process that is designed to\ndetermine the carbon exposure of a security in\nterms of its greenhouse gas emissions and its\npotential carbon emissions from fossil fuel\nreserves, such that the Index Provider can\ndetermine the level of climate-related risk\nexposure and management assessment of those\ncompanies. Greenhouse gas emissions data is\ncollected by the Index Provider and includes\ncompany-specific direct (Scope 1) and indirect\n(Scope 2) greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG \u201d ) emissions\ndata from company public documents and/or the\nCarbon Disclosure Project. If a company does\nnot report GHG emissions, then the Index\nProvider uses a proprietary methodology to\nestimate Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. To\ndetermine a security\u2019s potential carbon\nemissions from fossil fuel reserves, the Index\nProvider collects fossil fuel reserves data\nwhere relevant for companies that have\nreserves, typically in the oil and gas, coal\nmining and electric utilities industries.\nWhile fossil fuel reserves can be used for\nseveral applications, including energy or\nindustrial ( e.g. , coking coal used for steel\nproduction), for the Underlying Index, only\nfossil fuel reserves used for energy are taken\ninto account. Sources include company\npublications, other public records and third-\nparty data providers. The Index Provider\nfurther refines the Underlying Index through\nan optimization process that aims to achieve\n(1) the lowest volatility in light of certain\nreplicability and investability constraints as\ndefined by the Index Provider; (2) at least a\n20% improvement in its weighted-average,\nindustry-adjusted ESG score relative to the\nMSCI USA Index; and (3) a reduction in carbon\nexposure as represented by at least a 30%\nreduction in carbon emissions relative to the\noverall size of a company and in potential\ncarbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves\nused for potential energy production per\ndollar of market capitalization relative to\nthe MSCI USA Index. At each semi-annual index\nreview, additional optimization constraints\nthat aim to ensure replicability and\ninvestability are employed, including the\nfollowing: (a) the weight of an index\nconstituent will be restricted to the lower of\n1.5% and 20 times the weight of the security\nin the MSCI USA Index; (b) the minimum weight\nof an index\n\n38\n\nconstituent will be 0.05%; (c) the sector\nweights of the Underlying Index will not\ndeviate more than +/- 5% from the sector\nweights of the MSCI USA Index; (d) the one-way\nturnover of the Underlying Index is capped at\n10% at each semi-annual index review. The\nUnderlying Index is also optimized using Barra\nstyle factors, which aim to capture the\nsystematic factors driving the risk and return\nof a security, including, but not limited to,\nsize, momentum, leverage, profitability,\ndividend yield and investment quality. No\nconstraint is applied on the exposure of the\nUnderlying Index to the two Barra volatility\nstyle factors (as defined by the Index\nProvider), but exposure to the other 14 Barra\nstyle factors is restricted to +/-0.25\nstandard deviations relative to the MSCI USA\nIndex. Calculation Methodology. The Fund\nutilizes the Underlying Index calculated with\ngross dividends reinvested. The use of gross\ndividends reflects the assumed reinvestment of\nthe entire dividend distributed to holders of\nthe underlying stock, without any adjustment\nfor taxes or withholding. The Underlying Index\nwill be rebalanced on a semi-annual basis. A\nconstituent that is removed from the MSCI USA\nIndex will be removed simultaneously from the\nUnderlying Index, and its weight will be\ndistributed pro rata among the remaining\nconstituents. Additions to the MSCI USA Index\nwill be considered for inclusion in the\nUnderlying Index at the next review. MSCI USA\nMinimum Volatility (USD) Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 170 Index\nDescription. The MSCI USA Minimum Volatility\n(USD) Index is an MSCI Global Standard Index.\nThe Underlying Index aims to reflect the\nperformance characteristics of a minimum\nvolatility strategy applied to the large- and\nmid-capitalization U.S. equity universe. The\nUnderlying Index is calculated by optimizing\nthe MSCI USA Index, its Parent Index, in USD\nfor the lowest absolute risk (within a given\nset of constraints). Historically, the\nUnderlying Index has shown lower beta and\nvolatility characteristics relative to the\nMSCI USA Index. Calculation Methodology. The\nFund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated\nwith gross dividends reinvested. The use of\ngross dividends reflects the assumed\nreinvestment of the entire dividend\ndistributed to holders of the underlying\nstock, without any adjustment for taxes or\nwithholding. MSCI USA Momentum SR Variant\nIndex Number of Components: approximately 125\nIndex Description. The MSCI USA Momentum SR\nVariant Index is an MSCI Global Standard\nIndex. The Underlying Index consists of stocks\nexhibiting relatively higher momentum\ncharacteristics from the MSCI USA Index (the \u201c\nParent Index \u201d ), as determined by MSCI Inc.\nThe MSCI USA Momentum SR Variant Index is a\nversion of the MSCI USA Momentum Index, which\nrebalances quarterly and applies turnover caps\nat each rebalance. A risk-adjusted price\nmomentum, defined by MSCI as the excess return\nover the risk-free rate ( i.e. , the 3 Month\nTreasury Bill Rate) divided by the annualized\nstandard deviation of weekly returns over the\npast 3 years, is calculated for each security\nin the Parent Index over 6- and 12- month time\nperiods. The 6- and 12-month risk-adjusted\nprice momentum calculations are then\nstandardized at +/-3 standard deviations and\ntranslated into an average momentum score. The\n125 securities with the highest positive\nmomentum scores are predetermined for the\nUnderlying Index at initial construction with\nan aim to attain a high exposure to the\nmomentum factor while maintaining sufficient\nmarket capitalization and number of securities\ncoverages. The weight of each Underlying Index\nconstituent is determined based on the product\nof the security\u2019s momentum score and its\nmarket capitalization weight in the Parent\nIndex and further adjusted to, among others,\nmitigate the impact of stock-specific risk.\nAdditionally, a capping methodology is applied\nso that each individual issuer is capped at 5%\nweight at reconstitution. The Index Provider\nalso takes into account certain\ndiversification rules. At reconstitution, if\nthe aggregate weight of stocks representing\nmore than 4.5% weight is greater than 22.5% of\nthe Underlying Index weight, the Underlying\nIndex is rebalanced such that the aggregate\nweight of stocks greater than 4.5% does not\nexceed 22.5% of the Underlying Index weight.\nBetween constitution dates, if the aggregate\nweight of stocks representing more than 5%\nweight is greater than 25% of the Underlying\nIndex weight, the Underlying Index is\nrebalanced such that the aggregate weight of\nstocks greater than 4.5% does not exceed 22.5%\nof the Underlying Index weight. The Underlying\nIndex is reconstituted quarterly. To determine\nthe constituent changes at each quarterly\nreconstitution, the Index Provider applies an\niterative algorithm to cap the one-way\nturnover per reconstitution at 30%.\n\n39\n\nCalculation Methodology. The Fund utilizes the\nUnderlying Index calculated with gross\ndividends reinvested. The use of gross\ndividends reflects the assumed reinvestment of\nthe entire dividend distributed to holders of\nthe underlying stock, without any adjustment\nfor taxes or withholding. MSCI USA Sector\nNeutral Quality Index Number of Components:\napproximately 125 Index Description. The MSCI\nUSA Sector Neutral Quality Index is an MSCI\nGlobal Standard Index. The Underlying Index is\nbased on a traditional market capitalization-\nweighted parent index, the MSCI USA Index,\nwhich includes U.S. large- and mid-\ncapitalization stocks. The Underlying Index\nseeks to measure the performance of securities\nin the parent index that exhibit higher\nquality characteristics relative to their\npeers within the corresponding Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) sector. To\nconstruct the Underlying Index, the quality\nscore of each security in the parent index is\ndetermined based on three main fundamental\nvariables: high return on equity, low earnings\nvariability and low leverage. A fixed number\nof securities with the highest positive\nquality scores are predetermined for the\nUnderlying Index at initial construction with\nan aim to attain a high exposure to the\nquality factor while maintaining sufficient\nindex market capitalization and number of\nsecurities coverage. The weight of each\nUnderlying Index constituent is determined\nbased on the product of the security\u2019s quality\nscore and its market capitalization weight in\nthe parent index and further adjusted to,\namong others, mitigate concentration risk.\nWeights in the Underlying Index are normalized\nso that sectors in the Underlying Index\nrepresent the same weight as in the Parent\nIndex. Additionally, each individual issuer is\ncapped at 5%. Calculation Methodology. The\nFund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated\nwith gross dividends reinvested. The use of\ngross dividends reflects the assumed\nreinvestment of the entire dividend\ndistributed to holders of the underlying\nstock, without any adjustment for taxes or\nwithholding. MSCI USA Small Cap Minimum\nVolatility (USD) Index Number of Components:\napproximately 291 Index Description. The MSCI\nUSA Small Cap Minimum Volatility (USD) Index\nis an MSCI Global Small Cap Index. The\nUnderlying Index aims to reflect the\nperformance of small-capitalization U.S.\nequities that in the aggregate are expected to\nhave lower volatility characteristics relative\nto the small-capitalization U.S. equity\nmarket. Each security included in the\nUnderlying Index is a current constituent of\nthe MSCI USA Small Cap Index, the parent\nindex. Index Methodology. The Underlying Index\nis designed to provide the lowest expected\nreturn variance using MSCI's multi-factor risk\nmodel, and then it is further refined by an\noptimization tool that seeks to optimize the\nparent index for the lowest absolute\nvolatility with a certain set of constraints.\nThese constraints help maintain Underlying\nIndex replicability and investability and\ninclude Underlying Index turnover limits, for\nexample, along with minimum and maximum\nconstituent, sector and/or country weights\nrelative to the parent index, and other factor\nconstraints, as measured by MSCI, including\nthose related to momentum, value, size, size\nnon-linearity ( i.e. , the performance\ndifferential between mid-capitalization\ncompanies versus large- and small-\ncapitalization companies), growth, liquidity\nand financial leverage. The Underlying Index\nis rebalanced (or is re-optimized) semi-\nannually in May and November. Calculation\nMethodology. The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with gross dividends\nreinvested. The use of gross dividends\nreflects the assumed reinvestment of the\nentire dividend distributed to holders of the\nunderlying stock, without any adjustment for\ntaxes or withholding. MSCI World ex USA\nEnhanced Value Index Number of Components:\napproximately 350 Index Description. The MSCI\nWorld ex USA Enhanced Value Index is an MSCI\nGlobal Standard Index. The investment results\nof the MSCI World ex USA Enhanced Value Index\nare based on a traditional market\ncapitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI\nWorld ex USA Index, which as of July 31, 2024\nincluded large- and mid- capitalization stocks\nacross the following 22 developed market\ncountries or regions: Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\nJapan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPortugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland and the U.K. The Underlying Index\nis designed to represent the performance of\nsecurities that exhibit higher value style\ncharacteristics relative to their peers within\nthe corresponding Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) sector.\n\n40\n\nIndex Methodology. The Underlying Index is\ndesigned to represent the performance of\nsecurities that exhibit relatively higher\nvalue characteristics within the parent index.\nThe value score for each security is\ncalculated by combining the scores of three\nvaluation descriptors based on publicly\nreported financial data: price-to-book value,\nprice-to-forward earnings and enterprise\nvalue-to-cash flow from operations. The\nUnderlying Index is constructed with a fixed\nnumber of securities constituting a subset of\nthe parent index based on their final value\nscores. The fixed number of securities is\nevaluated semi-annually. MSCI assigns weights\nby multiplying a component's final value score\nby its market capitalization. Weights in the\nUnderlying Index are next normalized so that\nsectors in the Underlying Index represent the\nsame weight as in the Parent Index. Coinciding\nwith the SAIRs of the parent index, the\nUnderlying Index is rebalanced on the last\nbusiness day of May and November. Calculation\nMethodology. The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. MSCI World ex\nUSA Low Size Index Number of Components:\napproximately 828 Index Description. The MSCI\nWorld ex USA Low Size Index is an MSCI Global\nStandard Index. The Underlying Index is based\non a traditional market capitalization-\nweighted parent index, the MSCI World ex USA\nIndex, which includes large- and mid-\ncapitalization stocks across the following 22\ndeveloped market countries: Australia,\nAustria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, and the U.K. Index Methodology.\nThe Underlying Index is constructed by\napplying a mathematical formula at each\nrebalancing that reweights the components of\nits market capitalization-weighted Parent\nIndex, such that the representation of smaller\ncapitalization companies is increased relative\nto larger capitalization companies. In\naddition, at each rebalancing, the Index\nProvider calculates a \u201c constraint factor \u201d\nfor each component. The constraint factor is\nthe ratio of the component\u2019s weight in the\nUnderlying Index to that component\u2019s weight in\nthe Parent Index. The constraint factor is\nheld constant between each rebalancing, except\nin the case of corporate events (as defined by\nthe Index Provider). Changes in the relative\nweight of an individual component in the\nParent Index due to market\nappreciation/depreciation result in that\ncomponent increasing/decreasing in weight in\nthe Underlying Index to hold the constraint\nfactor for that component constant between\neach rebalancing. The Underlying Index is\nrebalanced semiannually in May and November.\nCalculation Methodology. The Fund utilizes the\nUnderlying Index calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. MSCI World ex\nUSA Momentum Index Number of Components:\napproximately 300 Index Description. The MSCI\nWorld ex USA Momentum Index is an MSCI Global\nStandard Index. The index consists of stocks\nexhibiting relatively higher momentum\ncharacteristics than the traditional market\ncapitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI\nWorld ex USA Index, which includes large- and\nmid-capitalization equity securities in\ndeveloped market countries, excluding the U.S.\nIt is designed to reflect the performance of\nan equity momentum strategy that emphasizes\nstocks with high price momentum, while\nmaintaining reasonably high trading liquidity,\ninvestment capacity and moderate index\nturnover. As of July 31, 2024, the Underlying\nIndex consisted of companies in the following\n22 countries or regions: Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\nJapan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPortugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland and the U.K. Index Methodology.\nThe MSCI World ex USA Momentum Index holds a\nfixed number of securities that are chosen\nfrom constituents within the parent index. A\nrisk-adjusted price momentum score, defined as\nthe excess return over the risk-free\n\n41\n\nrate divided by the annualized standard\ndeviation of weekly returns over the past 3\nyears, is calculated for each security in the\nparent index over 6- and 12-month time\nperiods. The 6- and 12- month risk-adjusted\nprice momentum calculations are then\nstandardized at +/-3 standard deviations and\nthe standardized z-scores are translated into\nan average momentum score. A fixed number of\nsecurities with the highest positive momentum\nscores are predetermined for the Underlying\nIndex at initial construction with an aim to\nattain a high exposure to the momentum factor\nwhile maintaining sufficient market\ncapitalization and number of securities\ncoverage. The weight of each Underlying Index\nconstituent is determined based on the product\nof the security\u2019s momentum score and its\nmarket capitalization weight in the parent\nindex and each individual issuer is capped at\n5%. MSCI uses an algorithm to determine the\nnumber of components in the Underlying Index\nbased on the number of constituents in the\nParent Index. Calculation Methodology. The\nFund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated\nwith net dividends reinvested. MSCI uses the\nindex constituent companies\u2019 country of\nincorporation to determine the relevant\ndividend withholding tax rates in calculating\nthe net dividends. The regular cash dividend\nis reinvested after deduction of withholding\ntax by applying the maximum rate of the\ncompany\u2019s country of incorporation applicable\nto institutional investors. Net dividends\nmeans dividends after taxes withheld at the\nrate applicable to non-resident institutional\ninvestors who do not benefit from double\ntaxation treaties. Such withholding rates may\ndiffer from those applicable to U.S.\nresidents. MSCI World ex USA Sector Neutral\nQuality Index Number of Components:\napproximately 299 Index Description. The MSCI\nWorld ex USA Sector Neutral Quality Index is\nan MSCI Global Standard Index. The Underlying\nIndex is based on a traditional market\ncapitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI\nWorld ex USA Index, which includes large- and\nmid-capitalization equity securities in\ndeveloped market countries, excluding the U.S.\nThe Underlying Index seeks to capture the\nperformance of quality stocks by identifying\ncommon stocks with high quality scores while\nmaintaining reasonably high trading liquidity,\ninvestment capacity and moderate index\nturnover. As of July 31, 2024, the Underlying\nIndex consisted of companies in the following\n22 countries or regions: Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\nJapan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPortugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland and the U.K. Index Methodology.\nThe MSCI World ex USA Sector Neutral Quality\nIndex holds a fixed number of securities that\nare chosen from constituents within the parent\nindex. The MSCI World ex USA Sector Neutral\nQuality Index aims to capture the performance\nof high quality stocks by identifying common\nstocks with high \u201c quality scores \u201d based on\nthree variables: Return on equity: Trailing\n12-month earnings per share divided by the\nlatest book value per share. Earnings\nvariability: Standard deviation of year-over-\nyear earnings per share growth over last five\nfiscal years. Debt-to-equity: Latest fiscal\nyear total debt-to-book value. The methodology\ncalculates a \u201c quality score \u201d for each\nsecurity in the parent index by averaging the\nz-scores of the three fundamental variables\nabove. A sector relative quality score is then\nderived by standardizing the composite quality\nz-scores within each sector. The sector-\nrelative quality scores are then standardized\nat +/- 3 standard deviations and the\nstandardized z-scores are translated into an\naverage quality score. A fixed number of\nsecurities with the highest positive quality\nscores are predetermined for the Underlying\nIndex at initial construction with an aim to\nattain a high exposure to the quality factor\nwhile maintaining sufficient index market\ncapitalization and number of securities\ncoverage. The weight of each Underlying Index\nconstituent is determined based on the product\nof the security\u2019s quality score and its market\ncapitalization weight in the parent index.\nWeights in the Underlying Index are next\nnormalized so that sectors in the Underlying\nIndex represent the same weight as in the\nParent Index. Additionally, each individual\nissuer is capped at 5%. The Underlying Index\nis rebalanced semi-annually. Calculation\nMethodology. The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents.\n\n42\n\nAdditional Information. \u201c MSCI, \u201d MSCI EAFE \u00ae\nIndex, MSCI EAFE \u00ae Growth Index, MSCI EAFE \u00ae\nMinimum Volatility Index, MSCI EAFE \u00ae Small\nCap Index, MSCI EAFE \u00ae Value Index, MSCI\nEurope Financials Index, MSCI Europe Minimum\nVolatility (USD) Index, MSCI Europe Small Cap\nIndex, MSCI Japan Minimum Volatility (USD)\nIndex, MSCI USA Index, MSCI USA Low Size\nIndex, MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Extended\nESG Reduced Carbon Target Index, MSCI USA\nMinimum Volatility Index, MSCI USA Momentum SR\nVariant Index, MSCI USA Sectoral Neutral\nQuality Index, MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index,\nMSCI World ex USA Enhanced Value Index, MSCI\nWorld ex USA Low Size Index, MSCI World ex USA\nMomentum Index, and MSCI World ex USA Sector\nNeutral Quality Index are servicemarks of MSCI\nInc. and have been licensed for use for\ncertain purposes by BFA or its affiliates.

In addition, certain companies\nincluded in the Underlying Index may also\noperate in business lines other than the theme\nto which they are assigned that also generate\nrevenue in other industries. The STOXX Indexes\nSTOXX Total Market Indexes Each of the STOXX\nTotal Market Indexes is a subset of the STOXX\nGlobal Total Market index (the \u201c Global TMI \u201d\n), which represents 95 percent of the free\nfloat market capitalization worldwide, with a\nvariable number of components. The STOXX\nglobal equity universe includes all common\nstocks and equities with similar\ncharacteristics from financial markets that\nprovide real-time and historical component and\ncurrency pricing. The Global TMI is the\nfraction of the STOXX investable universe\nlisted on eligible stock exchanges. The STOXX\nCountry Total Market indexes form the basis\nfor all regional STOXX Total Market indexes\n(each, a \u201c Regional TMI \u201d ). Each STOXX\nCountry Total Market index aims to represent a\nbroad market and covers at least 95 percent of\nthe free float market capitalization of the\nrespective country\u2019s investable universe. Each\nof the STOXX Total Market Indexes is derived\nfrom its respective Regional TMI(s). STOXX\nWorld Equity Indexes The STOXX World Equity\nIndexes includes a number of regional, country\nand sector equity indexes which are modular\ncomponents of the STOXX World AC All Cap Index\n(AC stand for All Countries). The STOXX World\nAC All Cap Index aims to provide a broad\nuniverse that includes all investable stocks,\nADR\u2019s and GDR\u2019s from all developed and\nemerging markets in the world. Large Cap, Mid\nCap and Small Cap Indexes provide coverage of\napproximately the top 70 percent, 85 percent\nand 95\n\n45\n\npercent of each respective countries\u2019 free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization. The\nuniverse for all countries besides China, is\nthe combination of the respective STOXX\nCountry Total Market Index, the respective\ncountry\u2019s constituents in the STOXX GCC Total\nMarket Index (a Regional TMI that aims to\nrepresent the Gulf Cooperation Council\ncountries market, which consists of Bahrain,\nKuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the\nUnited Arab Emirates) and the respective\ncountry\u2019s constituents of the STOXX World DR\nIndex (a free-float market capitalization-\nweighted index of depositary receipts whose\nuniverse includes ADRs and GDRs that are\ntraded on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ,\nor the London Stock Exchange). For China the\nuniverse is the aggregate of the STOXX China\nTotal Market Index, the STOXX China A Total\nMarket Index, the STOXX China P-Chip Total\nMarket Index, and the China constituents in\nthe STOXX Global DR Index. STOXX International\nEquity Factor Index Number of Components:\napproximately 442 Index Description. The STOXX\nInternational Equity Factor Index is a rules-\nbased equity index provided by STOXX Ltd. The\nUnderlying Index is a subset of the STOXX\nGlobal 1800 ex-USA (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ).\nThe Parent Index is a subset of the STOXX\nGlobal 1800, which is a fixed component index\nthat measures the performance of the largest\ndeveloped market stocks and is an aggregation\nof these indices: STOXX North America 600,\nSTOXX Asia/Pacific 600 and STOXX Europe 600.\nThe Parent Index is a free float market\ncapitalization-weighted index that measures\nthe performance of the largest companies of\nthe developed equity market excluding the\nU.S., as defined by STOXX. Free float market\ncapitalization is calculated by multiplying\nthe total market capitalization of a security\nby a free float factor, as determined by the\nIndex Provider, to reflect the market\ncapitalization of the number of shares\navailable in the market (rather than that of\nthe total number of shares outstanding). The\nUnderlying Index is composed of large- and\nmid-capitalization equity securities from the\nParent Index that are selected and weighted\nusing an optimization process designed to\nmaximize exposure to five target factors:\nmomentum, quality, value, low volatility and\nsize. The Underlying Index also seeks to\nmitigate exposure to unintended systematic\nexposures, limit turnover and maintain a level\nof risk similar to that of the Parent Index.\nIndex Methodology. The momentum score is\ncalculated from the following signals: price\nmomentum, earnings momentum and earnings\nannouncement drift ( i.e. , the difference\nbetween a stock\u2019s performance on and\nimmediately following an earnings announcement\ndate). The quality score is calculated from\nthe following signals: gross profitability,\nshare dilution, accruals, changes in net\noperating assets, carbon emissions intensity\nand greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG \u201d ) reduction\ntargets. Carbon emissions intensity is based\non the issuer\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG\nemissions ( i.e. , direct emissions from\nsources that an issuer owns or controls and\nindirect emissions from the issuer\u2019s purchase\nof energy) relative to peers in its Industry\nClassification Benchmark ( \u201c ICB \u201d )\nSupersector, as reported by Institutional\nShareholder Services ( \u201c ISS \u201d ). The GHG\ntargets signal is based on the robustness of\nan issuer's GHG reduction targets, including\nwhether they are part of the Science Based\nTargets initiative ( \u201c SBTi \u201d ) framework;\nthis is assessed by ISS based on its own ESG\nratings data and SBTi data. The value score is\ncalculated from the following signals: current\nbook value-to-price ratio, dividend yield (\ni.e. , 12-month trailing dividend divided by\ntotal market capitalization), earnings yield (\ni.e. , 12-month net income divided by total\nmarket capitalization), cash flow yield ( i.e.\n, 12-month cash flow divided by total market\ncapitalization) and time series normalized\ncash flow yield over the previous 36 months.\nThe low volatility score is based on prior\n12-month volatility, as calculated by the\nIndex Provider. The size score seeks to\nmeasure an issuer\u2019s market capitalization\nrelative to other companies in the Parent\nIndex. The Index Provider derives a composite\nscore based on a combination of the five\nfactors at the following weights: momentum,\n27%; quality, 36%; value, 27%; low volatility,\n5%; and size, 5%. The composite score is an\ninput to the optimization process through\nwhich the Index Provider selects securities\nfrom the Parent Index and assigns weights. The\noptimization process seeks to maximize the\noverall exposure to the five factors while\napplying certain constraints, which include\nthe following: \u2022 A constituent\u2019s minimum\nweight is the greater of 0% and its weight in\nthe Parent Index minus 2%. \u2022 A constituent\u2019s\nmaximum weight is the lesser of its weight in\nthe Parent Index plus 2% and 20 times its\nParent Index weight. \u2022 The maximum weight for\na single issuer is 10% of the Underlying\nIndex.\n\n46\n\n\u2022 The sum of issuer weights that are\nindividually greater than 4.5% must be less\nthan 22.5% of the Underlying Index. \u2022 The\nmaximum exposure to each ICB Industry (Level\n1) (as defined by the Index Provider) must be\nwithin 2% of the exposure in the Parent Index.\n\u2022 The exposure to a particular country must be\nwithin 5% of the exposure in the Parent Index.\n\u2022 The maximum one-way turnover at each\nquarterly rebalance is 5%. \u2022 The maximum ex\nante tracking error relative to the Parent\nIndex is 1%. \u2022 Constraints are also applied\nfor the minimum and maximum exposures to the\nfive factors relative to the Parent Index. The\nUnderlying Index is reviewed and rebalanced\neach March, June, September and December.\nSTOXX International Small-Cap Equity Factor\nIndex Number of Components: approximately\n1,027 Index Description. The STOXX\nInternational Small-Cap Equity Factor Index\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ) is a subset of the\nSTOXX International Developed Markets Small\nCap Index (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), which is a\nfree float market capitalization-weighted\nindex designed to measure the performance of\nsmall-capitalization companies from developed\nmarket countries excluding the U.S. Small-\ncapitalization companies, as calculated by the\nIndex Provider, represent approximately the\nbottom 15% of the investable market\ncapitalization of each developed market\ncountry included in the Parent Index, as\ndefined by STOXX. Free float market\ncapitalization is calculated by multiplying\nthe total market capitalization of a security\nby a free float factor, as determined by the\nIndex Provider, to reflect the market\ncapitalization of the number of shares\navailable in the market (rather than that of\nthe total number of shares outstanding). The\nUnderlying Index is composed of small-\ncapitalization equity securities from the\nParent Index that are selected and weighted\nusing an optimization process designed to\nmaximize exposure to four target factors:\nmomentum, quality, value, and low volatility.\nThe Underlying Index also seeks to mitigate\nexposure to unintended systematic exposures,\nlimit turnover and maintain a level of risk\nsimilar to that of the Parent Index.

The momentum score is calculated\nfrom the following signals: price momentum,\nearnings momentum and earnings announcement\ndrift (i.e., the difference between a stock\u2019s\nperformance on and immediately following an\nearnings announcement date). The quality score\nis calculated from the following signals:\ngross profitability, share dilution, accruals,\nchanges in net operating assets, carbon\nemissions intensity and greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG\n\u201d ) reduction targets. Carbon emissions\nintensity is based on the issuer\u2019s Scope 1 and\nScope 2 GHG emissions ( i.e., direct emissions\nfrom sources that an issuer owns or controls\nand indirect emissions from the issuer\u2019s\npurchase of energy) relative to peers in its\nIndustry Classification Benchmark ( \u201c ICB \u201d )\nSupersector, as reported by Institutional\nShareholder Services ( \u201c ISS \u201d ).

Engage in the\nbusiness of underwriting securities issued by\nother persons, except to the extent that the\nFund may technically be deemed to be an\nunderwriter under the 1933 Act in disposing of\nportfolio securities.

For purposes of this\nlimitation, securities of the U.S. government\n(including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities), repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities,\nand securities of state or municipal\ngovernments and their political subdivisions\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. 2. Borrow money, except that (i)\neach Fund may borrow from banks for temporary\nor emergency (not leveraging) purposes,\nincluding the meeting of redemption requests\nwhich might otherwise require the untimely\ndisposition of securities; and (ii) each Fund\nmay, to the extent consistent with its\ninvestment policies, enter into repurchase\nagreements, reverse repurchase agreements,\nforward roll transactions and similar\ninvestment strategies and techniques.

Notations Regarding\neach Fund's Fundamental Investment Policies\nThe following notations are not considered to\nbe part of a Fund\u2019s fundamental investment\npolicies and are subject to change without\nshareholder approval. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to concentration\nset forth in (1) above, the Investment Company\nAct does not define what constitutes \u201c\nconcentration \u201d in an industry. The SEC staff\nhas taken the position that investment of 25%\nor more of a fund\u2019s total assets in one or\nmore issuers conducting their principal\nactivities in the same industry or group of\nindustries constitutes concentration. It is\npossible that interpretations of concentration\ncould change in the future. The policy in (1)\nabove will be interpreted to refer to\nconcentration as that term may be interpreted\nfrom time to time. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to permit investment without limit\nin the following: securities of the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; securities of state,\nterritory, possession or municipal governments\nand their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\neach Fund's industry classifications, each\nFund currently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to each\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits each Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund's total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires each Fund to maintain at all\ntimes an \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300%\nof the amount of its borrowings. Asset\ncoverage means the ratio that the value of\neach Fund's total assets (including amounts\nborrowed), minus liabilities other than\nborrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of\nall borrowings. Borrowing money to increase\nportfolio holdings is known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d\nCertain trading practices and investments,\nsuch as reverse repurchase agreements, may be\nconsidered to be borrowings or involve\nleverage and thus are subject to the\nInvestment Company Act restrictions. In\naccordance with Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act, when each Fund engages\nin reverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions, the Fund may either\n(i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300%\nwith respect to such transactions and any\nother borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii)\ntreat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of a fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the\n\n52\n\nbusiness of underwriting, the policy in (5)\nabove will be interpreted not to prevent a\nfund from engaging in transactions involving\nthe acquisition or disposition of portfolio\nsecurities, regardless of whether a fund may\nbe considered to be an underwriter under the\n1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the\nunderwriting business to the extent permitted\nby applicable law. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit each Fund from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies of the\nFunds. Under its non-fundamental investment\nrestrictions, which may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval, each Fund\nmay not: 1. Purchase shares of any registered\nopen-end investment company or registered unit\ninvestment trust, in reliance on Section\n12(d)(1)(F) or (G) of the Investment Company\nAct, at any time the Fund has knowledge that\nits shares are purchased by another investment\ncompany investor in reliance on the provisions\nof subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1). The\nforegoing restriction does not restrict the\nFund from acquiring the shares of registered\nopen-end investment companies to the extent\notherwise permissible under other provisions\nof the 1940 Act, as interpreted, modified or\notherwise permitted by regulatory authority\nhaving jurisdiction, from time to time. 2. In\naccordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act,\nunder normal circumstances, invest less than\n80% of the value of its net assets, plus the\namount of any borrowings for investment\npurposes, in component securities of its\nUnderlying Index or in Depositary Receipts\nrepresenting component securities in the\nUnderlying Index. A Fund will notify its\nshareholders at least 60 days prior to any\nchange in its restrictions described in 2\nabove. Notations Regarding each Fund's\nFundamental and Non-Fundamental Investment\nPolicies Unless otherwise indicated, all\nlimitations under a Fund\u2019s fundamental or non-\nfundamental investment restrictions apply only\nat the time that a transaction is undertaken.\nAny change in the percentage of a Fund\u2019s\nassets invested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from market fluctuations\nor other changes in a Fund\u2019s total assets will\nnot require the Fund to dispose of an\ninvestment. Continuous Offering The method by\nwhich Creation Units are created and traded\nmay raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery requirement and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client\nmay be deemed a statutory underwriter if it\ntakes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into\nconstituent shares and sells such shares\ndirectly to customers or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of new shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the 1933 Act must take into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-\ndealer or its client in the particular case\nand the examples mentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions\nin shares, whether or not participating in the\ndistribution of shares, generally are required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in\nrespect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus delivery obligation with\nrespect to shares of the Funds are reminded\nthat, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act,\na prospectus delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the 1933\n\n53\n\nAct owed to an exchange member in connection\nwith a sale on the Listing Exchange generally\nis satisfied by the fact that the prospectus\nis available at the Listing Exchange upon\nrequest. The prospectus delivery mechanism\nprovided in Rule 153 is available only with\nrespect to transactions on an exchange.\nManagement Trustees and Officers. The Board\nhas responsibility for the overall management\nand operations of the Funds, including general\nsupervision of the duties performed by BFA and\nother service providers. Each Trustee serves\nuntil he or she resigns, is removed, dies,\nretires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer\nshall hold office until his or her successor\nis elected and qualifies or until his or her\ndeath, resignation or removal. Trustees who\nare not \u201c interested persons \u201d (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the Trust are referred to as\nindependent trustees ( \u201c Independent Trustees\n\u201d ). The registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nBlackRock-advised Funds \u201d ) are organized into\nthe BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex, the\nBlackRock Fixed-Income Complex and the iShares\nComplex (each, a \u201c BlackRock Fund Complex \u201d ).\nEach Fund is included in the iShares Complex,\nwhich includes iShares Trust, iShares U.S. ETF\nTrust, and iShares, Inc. Each Trustee also\nserves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a\nTrustee of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a\nresult, oversees all of the funds within the\niShares Complex, which consists of 420 funds\nas of November 29, 2024. With the exception of\nStephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron\nWasserman, the address of each Trustee and\nofficer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address\nof Mr. Kapito and Mr. Wasserman is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001.

Board \u2013\nLeadership Structure and Oversight\nResponsibilities Overall responsibility for\noversight of the Funds rests with the Board.\nThe Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds\non a day-to-day basis. The Board is\nresponsible for overseeing BFA and other\nservice providers in the operations of the\nFunds in accordance with the provisions of the\n1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and\nother laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The Board\nis currently composed of eleven members, nine\nof whom are Independent Trustees. The Board\ncurrently conducts regular in person meetings\nfour times a year. In addition, the Board\nfrequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The Independent Trustees meet\nregularly outside the presence of management,\nin executive session or with other service\nproviders to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Funds, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Funds with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the\n\n61\n\noversight functions delegated to the Committee\nby the Board and reports its finding to the\nBoard. The Board and each standing Committee\nconduct annual assessments of their oversight\nfunction and structure. The Board has\ndetermined that the Board\u2019s leadership\nstructure is appropriate because it allows the\nBoard to exercise independent judgment over\nmanagement and it allocates areas of\nresponsibility among committees of Independent\nTrustees and the full Board to enhance\neffective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Funds is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Funds. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of each\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Funds. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by each Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting each Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Funds'\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support each Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight responsibilities.\nFrom time to time, the Board may modify the\nmanner in which it conducts risk oversight.\nThe Board\u2019s oversight role does not make it a\nguarantor of the Funds' investment performance\nor other activities.

Certain activities of\nBFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively\nreferred to in this section as \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, with respect to the Funds and/or\nother accounts managed by BlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, including the business units or\nentities and personnel who may be involved in\nthe investment activities and business\noperations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in\nbusinesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Funds. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage a Fund and\nits shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by a Fund.\n\n74\n\nBlackRock has proprietary interests in, and\nmay manage or advise with respect to, accounts\nor funds (including separate accounts and\nother funds and collective investment\nvehicles) that have investment objectives\nsimilar to those of a Fund and/or that engage\nin transactions in the same types of\nsecurities, currencies and instruments as the\nFunds. BlackRock is also a major participant\nin the global currency, equities, swap and\nfixed-income markets, in each case, for the\naccounts of clients and, in some cases, on a\nproprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or\nmay be actively engaged in transactions in the\nsame securities, currencies, and instruments\nin which a Fund invests. Such activities could\naffect the prices and availability of the\nsecurities, currencies, and instruments in\nwhich a Fund invests, which could have an\nadverse impact on a Fund's performance. Such\ntransactions, particularly in respect of most\nproprietary accounts or client accounts, will\nbe executed independently of a Fund's\ntransactions and thus at prices or rates that\nmay be more or less favorable than those\nobtained by the Funds. When BlackRock seeks to\npurchase or sell the same assets for managed\naccounts, including a Fund, the assets\nactually purchased or sold may be allocated\namong the accounts on a basis determined in\nits good faith discretion to be equitable. In\nsome cases, this system may adversely affect\nthe size or price of the assets purchased or\nsold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of a\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding a\nFund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for a Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause a Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so. Conflicts may also\narise because portfolio decisions regarding a\nFund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby a Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and\nthe purchase of a security or covering of a\nshort position in a security by a Fund may\nincrease the price of the same security held\nby (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its\nother accounts or funds. In addition, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, certain\nFunds may invest their assets in other funds\nadvised by BlackRock, including funds that are\nmanaged by one or more of the same portfolio\nmanagers, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to asset allocation, timing\nof Fund purchases and sales, and increased\nremuneration and profitability for BlackRock,\nand/or its personnel, including portfolio\nmanagers. In certain circumstances, BlackRock,\non behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from\nor sell securities to another fund or account\nadvised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is\nnot required to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when a\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which a Fund has\ninvested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of a\nFund's investments may be negatively impacted\nby the activities of BlackRock or its clients,\nand transactions for the Fund may be impaired\nor effected at prices or terms that may be\nless favorable than would otherwise have been\nthe case. The results of a Fund\u2019s investment\nactivities may differ significantly from the\nresults achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by a Fund.\nMoreover, it is possible that a Fund will\nsustain losses during periods in which one or\nmore proprietary or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock achieve significant\nprofits. The opposite result is also possible.\n\n75\n\nFrom time to time, a Fund may be restricted\nfrom purchasing or selling securities, or from\nengaging in other investment activities\nbecause of regulatory, legal or contractual\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock or other\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock,\nand/or the internal policies of BlackRock\ndesigned to comply with such requirements. As\na result, there may be periods, for example,\nwhen BlackRock will not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions in certain\nsecurities or instruments with respect to\nwhich BlackRock is performing services or when\nposition limits have been reached. For\nexample, the investment activities of\nBlackRock for its proprietary accounts and\naccounts under its management may limit the\ninvestment opportunities for a Fund in certain\nemerging and other markets in which\nlimitations are imposed upon the amount of\ninvestment, in the aggregate or in individual\nissuers, by affiliated foreign investors. In\nconnection with its management of a Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on behalf of a Fund in\naccordance with such analysis and models. In\naddition, BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to make available any information\nregarding its proprietary activities or\nstrategies, or the activities or strategies\nused for other accounts managed by them, for\nthe benefit of the management of a Fund and it\nis not anticipated that BlackRock will have\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the\nactivities or strategies used for accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock or other client accounts\ncould conflict with the transactions and\nstrategies employed by BlackRock in managing a\nFund. The Funds may be included in investment\nmodels developed by BlackRock for use by\nclients and financial advisors. To the extent\nclients invest in these investment models and\nincrease the assets under management of the\nFunds, the investment management fee amounts\npaid by the Funds to BlackRock may also\nincrease. The price, availability and\nliquidity of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by model-\ndriven investment portfolios, as well as by\nBlackRock itself and by its advisory clients.\nIn addition, certain principals and certain\nemployees of a Fund\u2019s investment adviser are\nalso principals or employees of other business\nunits or entities within BlackRock. As a\nresult, these principals and employees may\nhave obligations to such other business units\nor entities or their clients and such\nobligations to other business units or\nentities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund\nin which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by a Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which a Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non a Fund could potentially lead to increased\npurchase activity with respect to the Fund and\nincreased assets under management for\nBlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Funds or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may from\ntime to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. A Fund may, subject\nto applicable law, purchase investments that\nare the subject of an underwriting or other\ndistribution by BlackRock and may also enter\ninto transactions with other clients of\nBlackRock where such other clients have\ninterests adverse to those of the Fund.\n\n76\n\nAt times, these activities may cause business\nunits or entities within BlackRock to give\nadvice to clients that may cause these clients\nto take actions adverse to the interests of a\nFund. To the extent such transactions are\npermitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock on\nan arm\u2019s-length basis. To the extent\nauthorized by applicable law, BlackRock may\nact as broker, dealer, agent, lender or\nadviser or in other commercial capacities for\na Fund. It is anticipated that the\ncommissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial\nadvisory fees, underwriting and placement\nfees, sales fees, financing and commitment\nfees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation\nor profits, rates, terms and conditions\ncharged by BlackRock will be in its view\ncommercially reasonable, although BlackRock,\nincluding its sales personnel, will have an\ninterest in obtaining fees and other amounts\nthat are favorable to BlackRock and such sales\npersonnel, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Funds. Index based funds may use an index\nprovider that is affiliated with another\nservice provider of a Fund or BlackRock that\nacts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in\nother commercial capacities for a Fund or\nBlackRock. Subject to applicable law,\nBlackRock (and its personnel and other\ndistributors) will be entitled to retain fees\nand other amounts that they receive in\nconnection with their service to the Funds as\nbroker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in\nother commercial capacities. No accounting to\nthe Funds or their shareholders will be\nrequired, and no fees or other compensation\npayable by the Funds or their shareholders\nwill be reduced by reason of receipt by\nBlackRock of any such fees or other amounts.\nWhen BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities in\nrelation to the Funds, BlackRock may take\ncommercial steps in its own interests, which\nmay have an adverse effect on the Funds. A\nFund will be required to establish business\nrelationships with its counterparties based on\nthe Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will\nnot have any obligation to allow its credit to\nbe used in connection with a Fund's\nestablishment of its business relationships,\nnor is it expected that the Fund's\ncounterparties will rely on the credit of\nBlackRock in evaluating the Fund's\ncreditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of BFA\npursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFunds. BlackRock will also receive\ncompensation for managing the reinvestment of\nthe cash collateral from securities lending.\nThere are potential conflicts of interests in\nmanaging a securities lending program,\nincluding but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto, among other things, increase or decrease\nthe amount of securities on loan or to lend\nparticular securities in order to generate\nadditional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock\nand its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto allocate loans to clients that would\nprovide more revenue to BlackRock. As\ndescribed further below, BlackRock seeks to\nmitigate this conflict by providing its\nsecurities lending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Funds and certain other\nclients and/or funds against a shortfall in\ncollateral in the event of borrower default.\nOn a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the\npotential dollar exposure of collateral\nshortfall resulting from a borrower default (\n\u201c shortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock may decline\nto make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of a\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. In addition, some bank\nborrowers may prefer certain BlackRock lenders\nthat provide additional protections against\nlender default that are favored by their\nprudential regulation. BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e ., indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a loan opportunity arrives; and\n(iii) the lending portfolio must also have\nenough inventory, either on its own or when\n\n77\n\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for a Fund may be\nbunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Funds will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Funds. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Funds will\nnot be charged the same commission or\ncommission equivalent rates in connection with\na bunched or aggregated order. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock may select brokers\nthat furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other\nBlackRock client accounts or personnel,\ndirectly or through correspondent\nrelationships, with research or other\nappropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Funds and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the\nFunds based on the amount of brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Funds and such other\nBlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client's commissions may not be\nused in managing that client's account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate benefits, of economies of\nscale or price discounts in connection with\nproducts and services that may be provided to\nthe Funds and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself. BlackRock\ndoes not currently enter into arrangements to\nuse the Funds' assets for, or participate in,\nsoft dollars, although BlackRock may receive\nresearch that is bundled with the trade\nexecution, clearing, and/or settlement\nservices provided by a particular broker-\ndealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives\nresearch on this basis, many of the same\nconflicts related to traditional soft dollars\nmay exist. For example, the research\neffectively will be paid by client commissions\nthat also will be used to pay for the\nexecution, clearing, and settlement services\nprovided by the broker-dealer and will not be\npaid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless\nprohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to\nexecute trades through brokers who, pursuant\nto such arrangements, provide research or\nother services in order to ensure the\ncontinued receipt of research or other\nservices BlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to engage in\nthe above described arrangements to varying\ndegrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by\napplicable law, may also enter into commission\nsharing arrangements under which BlackRock may\nexecute transactions through a broker-dealer,\nand request that the broker-dealer allocate a\nportion of the commissions or commission\ncredits to another firm that provides research\nto BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock\nengages in commission sharing arrangements,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. BlackRock\nmay utilize certain electronic crossing\nnetworks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including, without\nlimitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an\ninvestment or other interest, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law) in executing\nclient securities transactions for certain\ntypes of securities. These ECNs may charge\nfees for their services, including access fees\nand transaction fees. The transaction fees,\nwhich are similar to commissions or\nmarkups/markdowns, will generally be charged\nto clients and, like commissions and\nmarkups/markdowns, would generally be included\nin the cost of the securities purchased.\nAccess fees may be paid by BlackRock even\nthough incurred in connection with executing\ntransactions on behalf of clients, including\nthe\n\n78\n\nFunds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may\noffer volume discounts that will reduce the\naccess fees typically paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent\nwith its obligation to seek to obtain best\nexecution in client transactions. BlackRock\nowns a minority interest in, and is a member\nof, Members Exchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly\ncreated U.S. stock exchange. Transactions for\na Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party\nbrokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue\nfor execution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of such Funds. In addition,\ntransactions in Fund shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the\nappropriate venue for the execution of such\norders. BlackRock has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent conflicts of\ninterest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Funds, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock's fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee the Proxy Voting Policy section of this\nSAI. It is also possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of a\nFund. Increasing a Fund\u2019s assets may enhance\nliquidity, investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the\nright, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw, to sell into the market or redeem in\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of a Fund acquired for its own accounts\nor the account of a BlackRock advisory client.\nA large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund\nby BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory\nclient could significantly reduce the asset\nsize of the Fund, which might have an adverse\neffect on the Fund's liquidity, investment\nflexibility, portfolio diversification,\nexpense ratio or ability to comply with the\nlisting requirements for the Fund. It is\npossible that a Fund may invest in securities\nof, or engage in transactions with, companies\nin which BlackRock has significant debt or\nequity investments or other interests. A Fund\nmay also invest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for which\nBlackRock provides and is compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances. In making\ninvestment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is\nnot permitted to obtain or use material non-\npublic information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the activities\nof BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in\npurchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment. BlackRock, its\npersonnel and other financial service\nproviders may have interests in promoting\nsales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock\nand its personnel, the remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Funds or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFunds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFunds may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor\nevents (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to a Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients'\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\na Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other data sources unavailable to the\nFund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will\ngenerally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to a Fund's\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund's pricing\n\n79\n\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan the valuation for such security or\ninvestment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock. As disclosed in more detail in the\nDetermination of Net Asset Value section in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, each Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value by BFA. BFA has been designated\nas each Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBFA pricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BFA using proprietary or third-party\nvaluation models, fair value represents only a\ngood faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of one or\nmore assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, a Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, a Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in a Fund bearing\nsome additional expenses. BlackRock and its\ndirectors, officers and employees, may buy and\nsell securities or other investments for their\nown accounts and may have conflicts of\ninterest with respect to investments made on\nbehalf of a Fund. As a result of differing\ntrading and investment strategies or\nconstraints, positions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees that are the\nsame, different from or made at different\ntimes than positions taken for a Fund. To\nlessen the possibility that a Fund will be\nadversely affected by this personal trading,\neach Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted\na code of ethics in compliance with Section\n17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts\nsecurities trading in the personal accounts of\ninvestment professionals and others who\nnormally come into possession of information\nregarding a Fund's portfolio transactions.\nEach code of ethics is available by contacting\nBlackRock at the telephone number on the back\ncover of each Fund\u2019s Prospectus or by\naccessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's\nInternet site at http://www.sec.gov, and\ncopies may be obtained, after paying a\nduplicating fee, by e-mail at\npublicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will not\npurchase securities or other property from, or\nsell securities or other property to, a Fund,\nexcept that a Fund may in accordance with\nrules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act\nengage in transactions with another Fund or\naccounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a\nresult of common officers, directors, or\ninvestment advisers or pursuant to exemptive\norders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock\nby the SEC. These transactions would be\neffected in circumstances in which BlackRock\ndetermined that it would be appropriate for a\nFund to purchase and another client of\nBlackRock to sell, or a Fund to sell and\nanother client of BlackRock to purchase, the\nsame security or instrument on the same day.\nFrom time to time, the activities of a Fund\nmay be restricted because of regulatory\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock and/or\nBlackRock's internal policies designed to\ncomply with, limit the applicability of, or\notherwise relate to such requirements. A\nclient not advised by BlackRock would not be\nsubject to some of those considerations. There\nmay be periods when BlackRock may not initiate\nor recommend certain types of transactions, or\nmay otherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of a Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which a Fund wishes to purchase\nor sell. However, if permitted by applicable\nlaw, and where consistent with BlackRock\u2019s\npolicies and procedures (including the\nnecessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Funds may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer.\n\n80\n\nThe investment activities of BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts and for client accounts\nmay also limit the investment strategies and\nrights of the Funds. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Funds invest in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or are\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invest in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Funds) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Funds or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Funds), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the\nFunds), may limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Funds),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations. In addition to the\nforegoing, other ownership thresholds may\ntrigger reporting requirements to governmental\nand regulatory authorities, and such reports\nmay entail the disclosure of the identity of a\nclient or BlackRock\u2019s intended strategy with\nrespect to such security or asset. BlackRock\nmay not serve as an Authorized Participant in\nthe creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement, certain Funds\nhave retained BRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to\nperform certain order processing, Authorized\nParticipant communications, and related\nservices in connection with the issuance and\nredemption of Creation Units of the Funds ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d )\non the design and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may have, or from\ntime to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its affiliates. In order to defray\ntransaction expenses and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, the Funds may\ncollect certain fees from Authorized\nParticipants in connection with cash\nsubstitutions for creation and redemption\ntransactions. While BlackRock uses good faith\nestimates of the expected costs to the Funds\nin determining the rates for fees collected by\nthe Funds related to creation and redemption\nactivity, BlackRock may have incentives to\nimprove Fund performance through the\ncollection of these fees. As these charges are\nbased on estimates, where the charges exceed\nactual transaction- related costs and/or\nexpenses incurred by a Fund, Fund performance\ncould improve as a result. BlackRock has\nestablished processes to oversee the\ndetermination of these estimates in an effort\nto mitigate this conflict. BlackRock may\nmaintain securities indices. To the extent\npermitted by applicable laws, the Funds may\nseek to license and use such indices as part\nof their investment strategy. Index based\nfunds that seek to track the performance of\nsecurities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Funds using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to a Fund\nand the Funds are\n\n81\n\nunder no obligation to use BlackRock indices.\nAny Fund that enters into a license for a\nBlackRock index cannot be assured that the\nterms of any index licensing agreement with\nBlackRock will be as favorable as those terms\noffered to other licensees. BlackRock may\nenter into contractual arrangements with\nthird-party service providers to a Fund ( e.g.\n, custodians, administrators and index\nproviders) pursuant to which BlackRock\nreceives fee discounts or concessions in\nrecognition of BlackRock\u2019s overall\nrelationship with such service providers.\nBlackRock may also enter into contractual\narrangements with such service providers\npursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional\ncosts if the service provider\u2019s services are\nterminated with respect to a Fund. To the\nextent that BlackRock is responsible for\npaying service providers out of its fees that\nit receives from the Funds, the benefits of\nlower fees, including any fee discounts or\nconcessions, or any additional savings, may\naccrue, in whole or in part, to BlackRock,\nwhich could result in conflicts of interest\nrelating to the use or termination of service\nproviders to a Fund. In addition, conflicts of\ninterest may arise with respect to contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to a Fund, or the selection of such\nproviders, particularly in circumstances where\nBlackRock is negotiating on behalf of both\nfunds that have a unitary management fee and\nthose that do not or different service\nproviders have different fee structures.\nConflicts of interest may arise as a result of\nsimultaneous investment management of multiple\nclient accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s investment\nprofessionals. For example, differences in the\nadvisory fee structure may create the\nappearance of actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest because such differences could create\npecuniary incentives for BlackRock to favor\none client account over another. BlackRock\nowns or has an ownership interest in certain\ntrading, portfolio management, operations\nand/or information systems used by Fund\nservice providers. These systems are, or will\nbe, used by a Fund service provider in\nconnection with the provision of services to\naccounts managed by BlackRock and funds\nmanaged and sponsored by BlackRock, including\nthe Funds, that engage the service provider\n(typically the custodian). A Fund\u2019s service\nprovider remunerates BlackRock for the use of\nthe systems. A Fund service provider\u2019s\npayments to BlackRock for the use of these\nsystems may enhance the profitability of\nBlackRock. BlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a\nservice provider in connection with the use of\nsystems provided by BlackRock may create an\nincentive for BlackRock to recommend that a\nFund enter into or renew an arrangement with\nthe service provider. In recognition of a\nBlackRock client\u2019s overall relationship with\nBlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in a Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock (including BFA), its\ndirectors, officers and employees, in addition\nto those described in this section, may give\nrise to additional conflicts of interest.\nInvestment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services Investment Adviser. BFA\nserves as investment adviser to each Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and\nBFA. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is\nregistered as an investment adviser under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nUnder the investment advisory agreement, BFA,\nsubject to the supervision of the Board and in\nconformity with the stated investment policies\nof each Fund, manages and administers the\nTrust and the investment of each Fund\u2019s\nassets. BFA is responsible for placing\npurchase and sale orders and providing\ncontinuous supervision of the investment\nportfolio of each Fund. Pursuant to the\ninvestment advisory agreement, BFA may, from\ntime to time, in its sole discretion and to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to a Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law.\n\n82\n\nBFA is responsible, under the investment\nadvisory agreement, for substantially all\nexpenses of the Funds, including the cost of\ntransfer agency, custody, fund administration,\nlegal, audit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Funds will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees). The following describes the\ncalculation of the management fee for each\nFund whose management fee is subject to\nbreakpoints. The management fee for all Funds\nis set forth in the table that follows the\ndescription of breakpoints. For its investment\nadvisory services to the iShares MSCI EAFE\nSmall-Cap ETF, BFA is paid a management fee\nfrom the Fund calculated based on the\naggregate average daily net assets of the\nfollowing iShares funds: iShares Europe ETF,\niShares International Select Dividend ETF and\niShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap ETF. The\nmanagement fee for the iShares MSCI EAFE\nSmall-Cap ETF equals the ratio of the Fund\u2019s\nnet assets over the aggregate net assets of\nthe above iShares funds multiplied by the\namount calculated as follows: 0.4000% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets less than or\nequal to $12 billion, plus 0.3800% per annum\nof the aggregate net assets over $12 billion,\nup to and including $18 billion, plus 0.3610%\nper annum of the aggregate net assets over $18\nbillion, up to and including $24 billion, plus\n0.3430% per annum of the aggregate net assets\nover $24 billion, up to and including $30\nbillion, plus 0.3259% per annum of the\naggregate net assets in excess of $30 billion.\nEffective June 30, 2022 and through July 31,\n2023, for its investment advisory services to\nthe iShares MSCI EAFE Min Vol Factor ETF and\nthe iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, BFA is paid a\nmanagement fee from each Fund corresponding to\nthe Fund\u2019s allocable portion of an aggregate\nmanagement fee calculated based on the\naggregate average daily net assets of the\nfollowing iShares funds: iShares MSCI ACWI\nETF, iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF, iShares\nMSCI EAFE ETF, iShares MSCI EAFE Min Vol\nFactor ETF and iShares MSCI Global Min Vol\nFactor ETF. The aggregate management fee for\nthe iShares MSCI EAFE ETF is calculated as\nfollows: 0.3500% per annum of the aggregate\nnet assets less than or equal to $30.0\nbillion, plus 0.3200% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $30.0 billion, up to\nand including $60.0 billion, plus 0.2800% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets over $60.0\nbillion, up to and including $90.0 billion,\nplus 0.2520% per annum of the aggregate net\nassets over $90.0 billion, up to and including\n$120.0 billion, plus 0.2270% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $120.0 billion, up\nto and including $150.0 billion, plus 0.2040%\nper annum of the aggregate net assets in\nexcess of $150.0 billion. Prior to June 30,\n2023, the aggregate management fee for the\niShares MSCI EAFE Min Vol Factor ETF was\ncalculated as follows: 0.3500% per annum of\nthe aggregate net assets less than or equal to\n$30.0 billion, plus 0.3200% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $30.0 billion, up to\nand including $60.0 billion, plus 0.2800% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets over $60.0\nbillion, up to and including $90.0 billion,\nplus 0.2520% per annum of the aggregate net\nassets over $90.0 billion, up to and including\n$120.0 billion, plus 0.2270% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $120.0 billion, up\nto and including $150.0 billion, plus 0.2040%\nper annum of the aggregate net assets in\nexcess of $150.0 billion. Effective June 30,\n2023, the aggregate management fee for the\niShares MSCI EAFE Min Vol Factor ETF equals\nthe ratio of the Fund\u2019s net assets over the\naggregate net assets of the above iShares\nfunds multiplied by 0.20% per annum of the\naggregate net assets. From August 1, 2023\nthrough July 31, 2024, for its investment\nadvisory services to the iShares MSCI EAFE\nValue ETF, BFA was paid a management fee from\nthe iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF calculated\nbased on the average daily net assets of the\niShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF as follows:\n0.4000% per annum of net assets less than or\nequal to $3.0 billion, plus 0.3800% per annum\nof net assets over $3.0 billion, up to and\nincluding $4.5 billion, plus 0.3610% per annum\nof net assets over $4.5 billion, up to and\nincluding $6.0 billion, plus 0.3430% per annum\nof net assets over $6.0 billion, up to and\nincluding $7.5 billion, plus 0.3258% per annum\nof net assets over $7.5 billion, up to and\nincluding $9.0 billion, plus 0.3096% per annum\nof net assets over $9.0 billion, up to and\nincluding $10.5 billion, plus 0.2941% per\nannum of net assets over $10.5 billion, up to\nand including $12.0 billion, plus 0.2793% per\nannum of net assets over $12.0 billion, up to\nand including $13.5 billion, plus 0.2653% per\nannum of net assets over $13.5 billion, up to\nand including $15.0 billion, plus 0.2520% per\nannum of net assets in excess of $15.0\nbillion. Effective August 1, 2024, for its\ninvestment advisory services to the iShares\nMSCI EAFE Value ETF, BFA is paid a management\nfee from the iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF\ncalculated based on the average daily net\nassets of the iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF as\nfollows: 0.4000% per annum of net assets less\nthan or equal to $3.0 billion, plus 0.3800%\nper annum of net assets over $3.0 billion, up\nto and including $4.5 billion, plus 0.3610%\nper annum of net assets over $4.5 billion, up\nto and including $6.0 billion, plus 0.3430%\nper annum of net assets over $6.0 billion, up\nto and including $7.5 billion, plus 0.3258%\nper\n\n83\n\nannum of net assets over $7.5 billion, up to\nand including $9.0 billion, plus 0.3096% per\nannum of net assets over $9.0 billion, up to\nand including $10.5 billion, plus 0.2941% per\nannum of net assets over $10.5 billion, up to\nand including $12.0 billion, plus 0.2793% per\nannum of net assets over $12.0 billion, up to\nand including $13.5 billion, plus 0.2653% per\nannum of net assets over $13.5 billion, up to\nand including $15.0 billion, plus 0.2520% per\nannum of net assets over $15.0 billion, up to\nand including $18.0 billion, plus 0.2394% per\nannum of net assets in excess of $18.0\nbillion.

As a consequence, from time to\ntime each Fund may receive a smaller\nallocation of an investment opportunity than\nit would have if the Portfolio Managers and\nBFA and its affiliates did not manage other\nportfolios or accounts. Like the Funds, the\nother portfolios or accounts for which the\nPortfolio Managers are primarily responsible\nfor the day-to-day portfolio management\ngenerally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its\naffiliates, as applicable, for its advisory\nservices. One or more of those other\nportfolios or accounts, however, may pay BFA\nor its affiliates a performance-based fee in\nlieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee\nfor its advisory services. A portfolio or\naccount with a performance-based fee would pay\nBFA or its affiliates a portion of that\nportfolio\u2019s or account\u2019s gains, or would pay\nBFA or its affiliates more for its services\nthan would otherwise be the case if BFA or any\nof its affiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or\n\n86\n\naccounts, in order to earn larger fees.\nAlthough BFA and each of its affiliates have\nan obligation to allocate resources and\nopportunities equitably among portfolios and\naccounts and intend to do so, shareholders of\nthe Funds should be aware that, as with any\ngroup of portfolios and accounts managed by an\ninvestment adviser and/or its affiliates\npursuant to varying fee arrangements,\nincluding performance-based fee arrangements,\nthere is the potential for a conflict of\ninterest, which may result in the Portfolio\nManagers favoring those portfolios or accounts\nwith performance-based fee arrangements. The\ntables below show, for each Portfolio Manager,\nthe number of portfolios or accounts of the\ntypes set forth in the above tables and the\naggregate of total assets in those portfolios\nor accounts with respect to which the\ninvestment management fees are based on the\nperformance of those portfolios or accounts as\nof July 31, 2024:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts        Performance   Total Assets  \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1  $3,129,000,0\u2026  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of July 31, 2024.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its underlying index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance.\n\n87\n\nAs of July 31, 2024, the Portfolio Managers\nbeneficially owned shares of the Funds, for\nwhich they are primarily responsible for the\nday-to-day

The Distributor's principal\naddress is 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001. Shares are continuously offered for\nsale by the Funds through the Distributor or\nits agent only in Creation Units, as described\nin the applicable Prospectus and below in the\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nsection of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts\nless than Creation Units are generally not\ndistributed by the Distributor or its agent.\nThe Distributor or its agent will arrange for\nthe delivery of the applicable Prospectus and,\nupon request, this SAI to persons purchasing\nCreation Units and will maintain records of\nboth orders placed with it or its agents and\nconfirmations of acceptance furnished by it or\nits agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer\nregistered under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a\nmember of the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc. ( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor\nis also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50\nU.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the\nU.S. Virgin Islands and the District of\nColumbia. The Distribution Agreement for each\nFund provides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii)\nthe vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the relevant Fund.

BFA or its affiliates may, from\ntime to time and from its own resources, pay,\ndefray or absorb costs relating to\ndistribution, including payments out of its\nown resources to the Distributor, or to\notherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that a Fund\nengages in securities lending, each Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Funds,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA,\npursuant to a written agreement (the \u201c\nSecurities Lending Agency Agreement \u201d ). Each\nFund retains a portion of the securities\nlending income and remits the remaining\nportion to BTC as compensation for its\nservices as securities lending agent.\nSecurities lending income is generally equal\nto the total of income earned from the\nreinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes\ncollateral investment fees as defined below),\nand any fees or other payments to and from\nborrowers of securities. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each\nFund is responsible for fees in connection\nwith the investment of cash collateral\nreceived for securities on loan in a money\nmarket fund managed by BFA (the \u201c collateral\ninvestment fees \u201d ); however, BTC has agreed\nto reduce the amount of securities lending\nincome it receives in order to effectively\nlimit the collateral\n\n91\n\ninvestment fees a Fund bears to an annual rate\nof 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will\nnot be subject to a sales load, redemption\nfee, distribution fee or service fee. To the\nextent that a Fund invests cash collateral in\na non-government money market fund, the Fund\nmay be subject to a discretionary liquidity\nfee of up to 2% on all redemptions.\nDiscretionary liquidity fees may be imposed or\nterminated at any time at the discretion of\nthe board of directors of the money market\nfund, or its delegate, if it is determined\nthat such fee would be, or would not be,\nrespectively, in the best interest of the\nmoney market fund. Additionally, a Fund will\nbe subject to a mandatory liquidity fee if the\nmoney market fund\u2019s total net redemptions on a\nsingle day exceed 5% of the money market\nfund\u2019s net assets, unless the liquidity costs\nare de minimis ( i.e ., less than one basis\npoint (0.01%)). The money market fund will\ndetermine the size of the mandatory liquidity\nfee by making a good faith estimate of certain\ncosts the money market fund would incur if it\nwere to sell a pro rata amount of each\nsecurity in the portfolio to satisfy the\namount of net redemptions on that day. There\nis no limit to the size of a mandatory\nliquidity fee. If the money market fund cannot\nestimate the costs of selling a pro rata\namount of each portfolio security in good\nfaith and supported by data, it is required to\napply a default liquidity fee of 1% on the\nvalue of shares redeemed on that day. The\nimposition of any such discretionary or\nmandatory liquidity fee would reduce the\nFund\u2019s returns on securities lending. Under\nthe securities lending program, the Funds are\ncategorized into one of several specific asset\nclasses. The determination of a Fund\u2019s asset\nclass category (fixed-income, domestic equity,\ninternational equity or fund-of-funds), each\nof which may be subject to a different fee\narrangement, is based on a methodology agreed\nto by the Trust and BTC.

In addition, commencing the\nbusiness day following the date that the\naggregate securities lending income (which\nincludes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the iShares\nComplex (as defined in the Management \u2014\nTrustees and Officers section of this SAI) in\na calendar year exceeds a specified threshold,\neach applicable Fund, pursuant to the current\nSecurities Lending Agency Agreement, will\nreceive for the remainder of that calendar\nyear securities lending income as follows:\nDomestic Equity Funds (i) 81% of securities\nlending income (which excludes collateral\ninvestment fees); and (ii) this amount can\nnever be less than 70% of the sum of\nsecurities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees. International Equity Funds\n(i) 85% of securities lending income (which\nexcludes collateral investment fees); and (ii)\nthis amount can never be less than 70% of the\nsum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees. The services\nprovided to the Funds by BTC in the most\nrecent fiscal year ended July 31, 2024\nprimarily included the following: (1)\nselecting borrowers from an approved list of\nborrowers and executing a securities lending\nagreement as agent on behalf of the Funds with\neach such borrower;\n\n92\n\n(2) negotiating the terms of securities loans,\nincluding the amount of fees; (3) directing\nthe delivery of loaned securities; (4)\nmonitoring the daily value of the loaned\nsecurities and directing the payment of\nadditional collateral or the return of excess\ncollateral, as necessary; (5) investing cash\ncollateral received in connection with any\nloaned securities; (6) monitoring\ndistributions on loaned securities (for\nexample, interest and dividend activity); (7)\nin the event of default by a borrower with\nrespect to any securities loan, using the\ncollateral or the proceeds of the liquidation\nof collateral to purchase replacement\nsecurities of the same issue, type, class and\nseries as that of the loaned securities; and\n(8) terminating securities loans and arranging\nfor the return of loaned securities to the\nFunds at loan termination.

BFA and/or\nits affiliates ( \u201c BFA Entities \u201d ) pay\ncertain broker-dealers, registered investment\nadvisers, banks and other financial\nintermediaries ( \u201c Intermediaries \u201d ) for\ncertain activities related to a Fund and other\nfunds or products sponsored and/or advised by\nBFA Entities (collectively for purposes of\nthis section, the \u201c Products \u201d ). BFA Entities\nmake these payments from their own assets and\nnot from the assets of the Fund. Although a\nportion of BFA Entities\u2019 revenue comes\ndirectly or indirectly in part from fees paid\nby the Fund or other Products (including, if\napplicable, any underlying Products held by\nthe Fund), these payments do not increase the\nprice paid by investors for the purchase of\nshares of, or the cost of owning, the Fund or\nother Products. BFA Entities make payments for\nIntermediaries\u2019 participation in activities\nthat are designed to make registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors more knowledgeable about\nexchange-traded products, including the Fund\nand other Products, or for other activities,\nsuch as participation in marketing activities\nand presentations, educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems ( \u201c\nEducation Costs \u201d ). BFA Entities also make\npayments to Intermediaries for certain\nprinting, publishing and mailing costs or\nmaterials relating to the Fund or other\nProducts ( \u201c Publishing Costs \u201d ). In\naddition, BFA Entities make payments to\nIntermediaries that make shares of the Fund or\nother Products available to their clients, in\nsome cases at a waived or reduced commission\nrate or ticket charge, develop new products\nthat feature iShares, create educational\ncontent about the Fund or other Products that\nis featured on an Intermediary\u2019s platform, or\notherwise promote the Fund or other Products.\nBFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or\nmake payments from their own assets to\nIntermediaries or other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\nbusiness of the BFA Entities or facilitate\ninvestment in the Fund or other Products.\nPayments of the type described above are\nsometimes referred to as revenue-sharing\npayments. Payments to an Intermediary may be\nsignificant to the Intermediary, and amounts\nthat Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or\nother investment professional may also be\nsignificant for your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional. Because an\nIntermediary may make decisions about which\ninvestment options it will recommend or make\navailable to its clients, what services to\nprovide for various products or what marketing\ncontent to make available to its clients based\non payments it receives or is eligible to\nreceive, such payments may create conflicts of\ninterest between the Intermediary and its\nclients. These financial incentives may cause\nthe Intermediary to recommend the Fund or\nother Products or otherwise promote the Fund\nor other Products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm. In addition to\nthe payments described above, BFA Entities\nhave developed proprietary tools, calculators\nand related interactive or digital content\nthat is made available through the\nwww.blackrock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Fund or other\nProducts.\n\n98\n\nAs of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have\ncontractual arrangements to make payments (in\naddition to payments for Education Costs or\nPublishing Costs) to one Intermediary,\nFidelity Brokerage Services LLC ( \u201c FBS \u201d ).\nEffective June 4, 2016, this relationship was\nexpanded to include National Financial\nServices, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an affiliate of\nFBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and\nsignificant arrangement (the \u201c Marketing\nProgram \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of their\naffiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d ) have\nagreed, among other things, to actively\npromote certain Funds and Products to\ncustomers, investment professionals and other\nintermediaries and in advertising campaigns as\nthe preferred exchange-traded product, to\noffer certain Funds and Products in certain\nFidelity platforms and investment programs, in\nsome cases at a waived or reduced commission\nrate or ticket charge, and to provide\nmarketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities\nhave agreed to facilitate the Marketing\nProgram by, among other things, making certain\npayments to FBS and NFS for marketing and\nimplementing certain brokerage and investment\nprograms. Upon termination of the arrangement,\nthe BFA Entities will make additional payments\nto FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of\ncriteria, including the overall success of the\nMarketing Program and the level of services\nprovided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down\nperiod. In addition, BFA Entities have entered\ninto other contractual arrangements with\nIntermediaries and certain other third parties\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\nbusiness of the BFA Entities or facilitate\ninvestment in the Fund or certain Products.\nSuch agreements can include payments by BFA\nEntities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. In certain cases, such\npayments to Intermediaries are subject to\ncertain minimum payment levels or tiered\npayments. With respect to certain Funds and\nProducts, payments by the BFA Entities may\ntake the form of, among other things, \u201c due\ndiligence \u201d payments for an Intermediary\u2019s\nreview of such Funds and Products; payment for\nproviding employee training and information\nrelating to such Funds and Products; fees for\naccess (in some cases on a preferential basis)\nto an Intermediary\u2019s registered\nrepresentatives, salespersons or other\npersonnel, fees for maintaining an\nIntermediary\u2019s investor platform, \u201c shelf\nspace \u201d payments for making such Funds and\nProducts available on the Intermediary\u2019s\nplatform or fees for providing assistance in\npromoting the sale of such Funds and Products.\nIn such cases, the payments to Intermediaries\nmay be tiered or based on a percentage of the\nvalue of the Funds and Products held by\ncustomers of the applicable Intermediary and\nmay also be subject to minimum payment levels.\nPayments made pursuant to such arrangements\nmay vary in any year and may be different for\ndifferent Intermediaries and third parties and\nmay reflect different services provided. As of\nthe date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and\nother third parties (or their respective\naffiliates) receiving one or more types of the\ncontractual payments described above include\n(in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit\nExchange, AE Wealth Management, LLC, American\nEnterprise Investment Services, Inc., Avantax\nInvestment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital\nMarkets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk\nAnalytics, LLC, Cetera Financial Group, Inc.,\nCharles Schwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund\nCentre AG, Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC,\nDorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, Dynasty\nFinancial Partners LLC, E*Trade Securities\nLLC, Envestnet Asset Management, Inc., eToro\nUSA Securities Inc., LPL Financial LLC,\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith\nIncorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC,\nNorthwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC,\nOrion Portfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC,\nPublic Holdings, Inc., Raymond James Financial\nServices, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary\nWealth Group, LLC, Stash Investments LLC, TD\nAmeritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc.,\nWells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells\nFargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\nProducts, including the Fund, in a year or\nother period, any of which arrangements may\ninclude an agreed-upon minimum or maximum\npayment, or any combination of the foregoing.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Fund or other Products. The Fund\nmay participate in certain market maker\nincentive programs of a national securities\nexchange in which an affiliate of the Fund\nwould pay a fee to the exchange used for the\npurpose of incentivizing one or more market\nmakers in the securities of the Fund to\nenhance the liquidity and quality of the\nsecondary market of securities of the Fund.\nThe fee would then be credited by the exchange\nto one or more market makers that meet or\nexceed liquidity and market quality standards\nwith respect to the securities of the Fund.\nEach market maker incentive program is subject\nto approval from the SEC. Any such fee\npayments made to an exchange will be made by\nan affiliate of the Fund solely for the\nbenefit of the Fund and will not be paid from\nany Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA\nmay also participate in such programs.\n\n99\n\nDetermination of Net Asset Value Valuation of\nShares. The NAV for each Fund is generally\ncalculated as of the close of regular trading\nhours on the New York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE\n\u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each\nbusiness day the NYSE is open. Valuation of\nassets held by a Fund is as follows: Equity\nInvestments. Equity securities traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange ( e.g. , NYSE),\non separate trading boards of a securities\nexchange or through a market system that\nprovides contemporaneous transaction pricing\ninformation (each an \u201c Exchange \u201d ) are valued\nusing information obtained via independent\npricing services, generally at the closing\nprice or, if an Exchange closing price is not\navailable, the last traded price on that\nExchange prior to the time as of which the\nassets or liabilities are valued. However,\nunder certain circumstances, other means of\ndetermining current market value may be used.\nIf an equity security is traded on more than\none Exchange, the current market value of the\nsecurity where it is primarily traded\ngenerally will be used. In the event that\nthere are no sales involving an equity\nsecurity held by a Fund on a day on which a\nFund values such security, the prior day\u2019s\nprice will be used, unless BFA determines that\nsuch prior day\u2019s price no longer reflects the\nfair value of the security, in which case such\nasset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset\n(as defined below). Options, Futures, Swaps\nand Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded equity\noptions (except those that are customized) for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values\nsuch option, the last bid (long positions) or\nask (short positions) price, if available,\nwill be used as the value of such option. If\nno bid or ask price is available on a day on\nwhich a Fund values such option, the prior\nday\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value a Fund\u2019s securities and other\nassets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time a Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich a Fund valued such security, the revised\npricing service quotation generally will be\napplied prospectively. Such determination will\nbe made considering pertinent facts and\ncircumstances surrounding the revision. The\nprice a Fund could receive upon the sale of\nany particular portfolio investment may differ\nfrom a Fund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for assets that trade in thin or\nvolatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation methodology or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. As a\nresult, the price received upon the sale of an\ninvestment may be less than the value ascribed\nby a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund\u2019s\nability to value its investment may also be\nimpacted by technological issues and/or errors\nby pricing services or other third-party\nservice providers. All cash, receivables and\ncurrent payables are carried on a Fund\u2019s books\nat their fair value. In the event that\napplication of the methods of valuation\ndiscussed above result in a price for a\nsecurity which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, each Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by a Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates.\n\n100\n\nUse of fair value prices and certain current\nmarket valuations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used in the Underlying\nIndex, which, in turn, could result in a\ndifference between a Fund\u2019s performance and\nthe performance of the Underlying Index. Fair\nValue. When market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, a Fund\u2019s investments are valued at\nfair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing a Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, a Fund. On\nany day the NYSE is open and a foreign market\nor the primary exchange on which a foreign\nasset or liability is traded is closed, such\nasset or liability will be valued using the\nprior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA is not\naware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. For certain foreign assets, a third-\nparty vendor supplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the movement of\na proprietary multi-factor model after the\nrelevant foreign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing methodology is\ndesigned to correlate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S. markets\nfollowing the close of the local markets to\nthe prices that might have prevailed as of a\nFund\u2019s pricing time. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee\nis responsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a\nFund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair\nValue Assets is subsequently reported to the\nBoard or a committee thereof. When determining\nthe price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will\nseek to determine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on which\nthe asset or liability is being valued, and\ndoes not seek to determine the price a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair\nvalue determinations will be based upon all\navailable factors that BFA deems relevant at\nthe time of the determination, and may be\nbased on analytical values determined by BFA\nusing proprietary or third-party valuation\nmodels. Fair value represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. When determining the fair value of\nan investment, one or more fair value\nmethodologies may be used (depending on\ncertain factors, including the asset type).\nFor example, the investment may be initially\npriced based on the original cost of the\ninvestment or, alternatively, using\nproprietary or third-party models that may\nrely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nEach Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements.\n\n101\n\nGenerally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules\napplicable to funds and various assets in\nwhich they invest are evolving. Such changes\nmay adversely affect a Fund. For example, the\nevolution of rules governing the determination\nof the fair market value of assets or\nliabilities, to the extent such rules become\nmore stringent, would tend to increase the\ncost and/or reduce the availability of third-\nparty determinations of fair market value.\nThis may in turn increase the costs associated\nwith selling assets or affect their liquidity\ndue to a Fund\u2019s inability to obtain a third-\nparty determination of fair market value.\nBrokerage Transactions Subject to policies\nestablished by the Board, BFA is primarily\nresponsible for the execution of a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio transactions and the allocation of\nbrokerage. BFA does not execute transactions\nthrough any particular broker or dealer, but\nseeks to obtain the best net results for the\nFunds, taking into account such factors as\nprice (including the applicable brokerage\ncommission or dealer spread), size of order,\ndifficulty of execution, operational\nfacilities of the firm and the firm\u2019s risk and\nskill in positioning blocks of securities.\nWhile BFA generally seeks reasonable trade\nexecution costs, a Fund does not necessarily\npay the lowest spread or commission available,\nand payment of the lowest commission or spread\nis not necessarily consistent with obtaining\nthe best price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including a\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause a Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for a Fund and may take into account\na variety of factors including: (i) the size,\nnature and character of the security or\ninstrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time, a\nFund may purchase new issues of securities in\na fixed price offering. In these situations,\nthe broker may be a member of the selling\ngroup that will, in addition to selling\nsecurities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). The\nFunds anticipate that brokerage transactions\ninvolving foreign equity securities generally\nwill be conducted primarily on the principal\nstock exchanges of the applicable country.\nForeign equity securities may be held by the\nFunds in the form of depositary receipts, or\nother securities convertible into foreign\nequity securities. Depositary receipts may be\nlisted on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC\nmarkets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may\nbe. ADRs, like other securities traded in the\nU.S., will be subject to negotiated commission\nrates. OTC issues, including most fixed-income\nsecurities such as corporate debt and U.S.\nGovernment securities, are normally traded on\na \u201c net \u201d basis without a stated commission,\nthrough dealers acting for their own account\nand not as brokers. The Funds will primarily\nengage in transactions with these dealers or\ndeal directly with the issuer unless a better\nprice or execution could be obtained by using\na broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit.\n\n102\n\nUnder the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a\nFund and persons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the dealers\nacting as principal for their own accounts,\nthe Funds will not deal with affiliated\npersons and affiliated persons of such\naffiliated persons in connection with such\ntransactions. The Funds will not purchase\nsecurities during the existence of any\nunderwriting or selling group relating to such\nsecurities of which BFA, BRIL or any\naffiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nthereof is a member except pursuant to\nprocedures adopted by the Board in accordance\nwith Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act. Purchases\nof money market instruments by the Funds are\nmade from dealers, underwriters and issuers.\nThe Funds do not currently expect to incur any\nbrokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Funds with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Funds\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. Initial public\nofferings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of securities may be\nover-subscribed and subsequently trade at a\npremium in the secondary market. When BFA is\ngiven an opportunity to invest in such an\ninitial offering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue,\nthe supply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in a Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well.\n\n103\n\nBecause different accounts may have differing\ninvestment objectives and policies, BFA may\nbuy and sell the same securities at the same\ntime for different clients based on the\nparticular investment objective, guidelines\nand strategies of those accounts. For example,\nBFA may decide that it may be entirely\nappropriate for a growth fund to sell a\nsecurity at the same time a value fund is\nbuying that security. To the extent that\ntransactions on behalf of more than one client\nof BFA or the other Affiliates during the same\nperiod increase the demand for securities\nbeing purchased or the supply of securities\nbeing sold, there may be an adverse effect on\nprice. For example, sales of a security by\nBlackRock on behalf of one or more of its\nclients may decrease the market price of such\nsecurity, adversely impacting other BlackRock\nclients that still hold the security. If\npurchases or sales of securities arise for\nconsideration at or about the same time that\nwould involve the Funds or other clients or\nfunds for which BFA or another Affiliate act\nas investment manager, transactions in such\nsecurities will be made, insofar as feasible,\nfor the respective funds and clients in a\nmanner deemed equitable to all. In certain\ninstances, BFA may find it efficient for\npurposes of seeking to obtain best execution,\nto aggregate or \u201c bunch \u201d certain\ncontemporaneous purchases or sale orders of\nits advisory accounts and advisory accounts of\naffiliates. In general, all contemporaneous\ntrades for client accounts under management by\nthe same portfolio manager or investment team\nwill be bunched in a single order if the\ntrader believes the bunched trade would\nprovide each client with an opportunity to\nachieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Funds are\nconcerned, in other cases it could be\nbeneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected\nby BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of\nmore than one of its clients during the same\nperiod may increase the demand for securities\nbeing purchased or the supply of securities\nbeing sold, causing an adverse effect on\nprice. The trader will give the bunched order\nto the broker-dealer that the trader has\nidentified as being able to provide the best\nexecution of the order. Orders for purchase or\nsale of securities will be placed within a\nreasonable amount of time of the order receipt\nand bunched orders will be kept bunched only\nlong enough to execute the order. The table\nbelow sets forth the brokerage commissions\npaid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted.\nAny differences in brokerage commissions paid\nby a Fund from year to year are principally\ndue to increases or decreases in that Fund\u2019s\nassets over those periods or the magnitude of\nchanges to the components of a Fund's\nUnderlying Index\n                                              \n

If purchases or\nsales of portfolio securities of the Funds and\none or more other accounts managed or advised\nby BlackRock are considered at or about the\nsame time, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Funds and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Funds\nare concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFunds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest\nfor its own account in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may,\nfrom time to time, effect trades on behalf of\nand for the account of the Funds with brokers\nor dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions.

The Trust issues shares of beneficial\ninterests in the funds with no par value. The\nBoard may designate additional iShares funds.\nEach share issued by a fund has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of that fund. Shares\nhave no preemptive, exchange, subscription or\nconversion rights and are freely transferable.\nEach share is entitled to participate equally\nin dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to the relevant fund, and\nin the net distributable assets of such fund\non liquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Following the creation of the\ninitial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund\nand immediately prior to the commencement of\ntrading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more\nthan 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject\nto the reporting provisions of Section 13 of\nthe 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould consult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff. In accordance with\nthe Trust's current Agreement and Declaration\nof Trust (the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the\nBoard may, without shareholder approval\n(unless such shareholder approval is required\nby the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Funds. Shares of\neach Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis\n\n108\n\nowned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of each\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of each Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with each Fund's\nlaunch, each Fund was seeded through the sale\nof one or more Creation Units by each Fund to\none or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof each Fund or each Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor each Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nEach Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant.\n\n109\n\nAny Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer\nor agents participating in the distribution of\nshares may be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the\n1933 Act, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\neach Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund\u2019s NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the applicable Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, the Funds may\nrequire orders to be placed earlier in the\nday.

A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\neach Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. Each Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\neach Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay.\n\n110\n\nFund Deposit. The consideration for purchase\nof Creation Units of a Fund generally consists\nof Deposit Securities and the Cash Component\ncomputed as described below. Together, the\nDeposit Securities and the Cash Component\nconstitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d which, when\ncombined with a Fund's portfolio securities,\nis designed to generate performance that has a\ncollective investment profile similar to that\nof the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent\ninvestment amount for a Creation Unit of any\nFund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject\nto any adjustments as described below, to\npurchases of Creation Units of shares of a\ngiven Fund until such time as the next-\nannounced Fund Deposit is made available. The\n\u201c Cash Component \u201d is an amount equal to the\ndifference between the NAV of the shares (per\nCreation Unit) and the \u201c Deposit Amount, \u201d\nwhich is an amount equal to the market value\nof the Deposit Securities, and serves to\ncompensate for any differences between the NAV\nper Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount.\nPayment of any stamp duty or other similar\nfees and expenses payable upon transfer of\nbeneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities\nare the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant purchasing a Creation Unit. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit\nSecurities change pursuant to changes in the\ncomposition of a Fund's portfolio and as\nrebalancing adjustments and corporate action\nevents are reflected from time to time by BFA\nwith a view to the investment objective of the\nFund. The composition of the Deposit\nSecurities may also change in response to\nadjustments to the weighting or composition of\nthe component securities constituting the\nrelevant Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit\nmay also be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nDeposit Securities portion of the Fund Deposit\nthrough \u201c systematic rounding. \u201d The rounding\nmethodology \u201c rounds up \u201d position sizes of\nsecurities in the Deposit Securities (which in\nturn reduces the cash portion). However, the\nmethodology limits the maximum allowed\npercentage change in weight and share quantity\nof any given security in the Fund Deposit.\nFund Deposits may also be modified to position\na fund towards a forward index rebalance to\nreflect revisions that account for index\nadditions, deletions, and re-weights. The\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the\nCash Component to replace any Deposit Security\nin certain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit partial or full cash purchases of\nCreation Units of its funds, when partial or\nfull cash purchases of Creation Units are\navailable or specified for a Fund, they will\nbe effected in essentially the same manner as\nin-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a\npartial or full cash purchase, the Authorized\nParticipant must pay the cash equivalent of\nthe Deposit Securities it would otherwise be\nrequired to provide through an in-kind\npurchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Funds, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith the Funds or one of their service\nproviders that allows such member or\nparticipant to place orders for the purchase\nand redemption of Creation Units is referred\nto as an \u201c Authorized Participant. \u201d All\nshares of the Funds, however created, will be\nentered on the records of DTC in the name of\nCede & Co. for the account of a DTC\nParticipant. Role of the Authorized\nParticipant. Creation Units may be purchased\nonly by or through a member or participant of\na clearing agency registered with the SEC,\nwhich has a written agreement with the Funds\nor one of their service providers that allows\nsuch member or participant to place orders for\nthe purchase and redemption of Creation Units\n(an \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ). Such\nAuthorized Participant will agree, pursuant to\nthe terms of such Authorized Participant\nAgreement and on behalf of itself or any\ninvestor on whose behalf it will act, to\ncertain conditions, including that such\nAuthorized Participant will make available in\nadvance of each purchase of shares an amount\nof cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component,\nonce the\n\n111\n\nNAV of a Creation Unit is next determined\nafter receipt of the purchase order in proper\nform, together with the transaction fees\ndescribed below. An Authorized Participant,\nacting on behalf of an investor, may require\nthe investor to enter into an agreement with\nsuch Authorized Participant with respect to\ncertain matters, including payment of the Cash\nComponent. Investors who are not Authorized\nParticipants must make appropriate\narrangements with an Authorized Participant.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not be a DTC Participant\nor may not have executed an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and that orders to\npurchase Creation Units may have to be placed\nby the investor's broker through an Authorized\nParticipant. As a result, purchase orders\nplaced through an Authorized Participant may\nresult in additional charges to such investor.\nThe Trust does not expect to enter into an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement with more\nthan a small number of DTC Participants. A\nlist of current Authorized Participants may be\nobtained from the Distributor. The Distributor\nhas adopted guidelines regarding Authorized\nParticipants\u2019 transactions in Creation Units\nthat are made available to all Authorized\nParticipants. These guidelines set forth the\nprocesses and standards for Authorized\nParticipants to transact with the Distributor\nand its agents in connection with creation and\nredemption transactions. In addition, the\nDistributor may be appointed as the proxy of\nthe Authorized Participant and may be granted\na power of attorney under its Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Purchase Orders. To\ninitiate an order for a Creation Unit, an\nAuthorized Participant must submit to the\nDistributor or its agent an irrevocable order\nto purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form,\ngenerally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on\nany Business Day to receive that day\u2019s NAV.\nThe Distributor or its agent will notify BFA\nand the custodian of such order. The custodian\nwill then provide such information to any\nappropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and\nrequirements governing the delivery of the\nFund Deposit are set forth in the procedures\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Investors, other\nthan Authorized Participants, are responsible\nfor making arrangements for a creation request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFunds, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\napplicable deadline for cash transfers by\ncontacting the operations department of the\nbroker or depositary institution effectuating\nthe transfer of the Cash Component. This\ndeadline is likely to be significantly earlier\nthan the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors\nshould be aware that an Authorized Participant\nmay require orders for purchases of shares\nplaced with it to be in the particular form\nrequired by the individual Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant is\nresponsible for any and all expenses and costs\nincurred by a Fund, including any applicable\ncash amounts, in connection with any purchase\norder. Timing of Submission of Purchase\nOrders. An Authorized Participant must submit\nan irrevocable order to purchase shares of a\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Funds to the Distributor or\nits agent pursuant to procedures set forth in\nthe Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic\nor market disruptions or changes, or telephone\nor other communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. Orders to create\nshares of a Fund that are submitted on the\nBusiness Day immediately preceding a holiday\nor a day (other than a weekend) when the\nequity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market\nare closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as that Fund's\n\u201c Cutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with a\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Funds are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFunds will accept the order, subject to each\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below.\n\n112\n\nOnce a Fund has accepted an order, upon the\nnext determination of the NAV of the shares,\nthe Fund will confirm the issuance of a\nCreation Unit, against receipt of payment, at\nsuch NAV. The Distributor or its agent will\nthen transmit a confirmation of acceptance to\nthe Authorized Participant that placed the\norder. Each Fund reserves the right to reject\nor revoke a creation order transmitted to it\nby the Distributor or its agent provided that\na rejection or revocation of a creation order\ndoes not violate Rule 6c-11 under the\nInvestment Company Act. For example, a Fund\nmay reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent if (i) the order is not in proper form;\n(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the\nshares ordered, would own 80% or more of the\ncurrently outstanding shares of the Fund;\n(iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not\nconform to the identity and number of shares\nspecified, as described above; (iv) acceptance\nof the Deposit Securities is not legally\nrequired or would, in the opinion of counsel,\nbe unlawful; or (v) circumstances outside the\ncontrol of the Fund, the Distributor or its\nagent and BFA make it impracticable to process\npurchase orders. The Distributor or its agent\nshall notify a prospective purchaser of a\nCreation Unit and/or the Authorized\nParticipant acting on behalf of such purchaser\nof its rejection of such order. The Funds,\nState Street, Citibank or JPMorgan, as\napplicable, the sub-custodian and the\nDistributor or its agent are under no duty,\nhowever, to give notification of any defects\nor irregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall any of them incur any\nliability for failure to give such\nnotification. Issuance of a Creation Unit.\nExcept as provided herein, a Creation Unit\nwill not be issued until the transfer of good\ntitle to the applicable Fund of the Deposit\nSecurities and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the sub-\ncustodian has confirmed to the custodian that\nthe securities included in the Fund Deposit\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant sub-\ncustodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor\nor its agent and BFA shall be notified of such\ndelivery and the applicable Fund will issue\nand cause the delivery of the Creation Unit.\nFor the iShares ESG MSCI USA Min Vol Factor\nETF, iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF,\niShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF, iShares\nMSCI USA Quality Factor ETF, iShares MSCI USA\nSize Factor ETF, iShares MSCI USA Small-Cap\nMin Vol Factor ETF, iShares MSCI USA Value\nFactor ETF, iShares U.S. Equity Factor ETF,\niShares U.S. Small-Cap Equity Factor ETF and\niShares U.S. Tech Breakthrough Multisector\nETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a\n\u201c T+1 basis \u201d (i.e., one Business Day after\ntrade date). For the iShares China Large-Cap\nETF, iShares International Equity Factor ETF,\niShares International Small-Cap Equity Factor\nETF, iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares MSCI EAFE\nGrowth ETF, iShares MSCI EAFE Min Vol Factor\nETF, iShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap ETF, iShares\nMSCI EAFE Value ETF, iShares MSCI Europe\nFinancials ETF, iShares MSCI Europe Small-Cap\nETF, iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF,\niShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor ETF and\niShares MSCI Intl Value Factor ETF, Creation\nUnits are generally issued on a \u201c T+2 basis \u201d\n(i.e., two Business Days after trade date).\nHowever, each Fund reserves the right to\nsettle Creation Unit transactions on a\ndifferent basis, if necessary or appropriate\nunder the circumstances and compliant with\napplicable law. These circumstances may\ninclude, among others, accommodating non-U.S.\nmarket holiday schedules and accounting for\ndifferent treatment among non-U.S. and U.S.\nmarkets of dividend record dates and ex-\ndividend dates (i.e., the last day the holder\nof a security can sell the security and still\nreceive dividends payable on the security). To\nthe extent contemplated by an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement with the Distributor,\neach Fund will issue Creation Units to such\nAuthorized Participant, notwithstanding the\nfact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have\nnot been received in part or in whole, in\nreliance on the undertaking of the Authorized\nParticipant to deliver the missing Deposit\nSecurities as soon as possible, which\nundertaking shall be secured by such\nAuthorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\nbuy Deposit Securities for the Funds. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by a Fund or its custodian on\nthe contractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Funds' current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent.

Under an ETF Services\nAgreement, the Funds have retained BRIL, an\naffiliate of BFA, to perform certain ETF\nServices. BRIL will receive from an Authorized\nParticipant a standard transaction fee on each\ncreation order, which consists of (1) a fee\nfor providing the ETF Services (the \u201c ETF\nServicing Fee \u201d ) and (2) transfer, processing\nand other transaction costs\n\n114\n\ncharged by a Fund custodian in connection with\nthe issuance of Creation Units for such\ncreation order ( \u201c Custody Transaction Costs \u201d\n). BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF\nServicing Fee pursuant to the ETF Services\nAgreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody\nTransaction Costs to the applicable Fund\ncustodian according to the amounts invoiced by\nsuch custodian. The ETF Servicing Fee is a\nflat fee per order regardless of the number of\nCreation Units being purchased, which amount\nwill vary among different Funds based on a\nnumber of factors, including the complexity of\nthe order and the types of securities or\ninstruments included in a Fund\u2019s Creation\nBasket, among other variables. The actual\nCustody Transaction Costs vary per order based\non the number of trades, underlying markets\nand settlement locations associated with the\nissuance of a Creation Unit. The following\ntable sets forth, for each Fund, either the\nactual creation transaction fee that was\ncharged on October 31, 2024 or an estimate of\nthe creation transaction fee that would have\nbeen charged if the Fund had issued a Creation\nUnit on that date. The actual fee that was or\nwould have been charged to an Authorized\nParticipant in connection with a creation\norder will vary over time depending on the\nfactors discussed above, and may be higher\nthan the fee set forth below. In order to\ndefray transaction expenses for a Fund and\nprotect against possible shareholder dilution,\nif a creation transaction consists solely or\npartially of cash, the Authorized Participant\nmay also be required to cover (up to the\nmaximum amount shown below) certain brokerage,\ntax, foreign exchange, execution and other\ncosts and expenses related to the execution of\ntrades resulting from such transaction (which\nmay, in certain instances, be based on a good\nfaith estimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread between the expected bid\nand offer side of the market and anticipated\nmarket impact).

Redemption\nof Creation Units. Shares of a Fund may be\nredeemed by Authorized Participants only in\nCreation Units at their NAV next determined\nafter receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form by the Distributor or its agent\nand only on a Business Day. The Funds will not\nredeem shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits. There can be no assurance, however,\nthat there will be sufficient liquidity in the\nsecondary market at any time to permit\nassembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should\nexpect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number\nof shares to constitute a Creation Unit that\ncould be redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant. Beneficial owners also may sell\nshares in the secondary market.\n\n115\n\nEach Fund generally redeems Creation Units for\nFund Securities (as defined below). Please see\nthe Cash Redemption Method section below and\nthe following discussion summarizing the in-\nkind method for further information on\nredeeming Creation Units of the Funds. Each\nFund publishes the designated portfolio of\nsecurities (including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be substituted)\nthat will be applicable to redemption requests\nreceived in proper form (as defined below) on\nthat day ( \u201c Fund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption\nBasket \u201d ), and an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash\nAmount, \u201d as described below) in order to\neffect redemptions of Creation Units of a\nFund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount\nwill remain in effect until such time as the\nnext announced composition of the Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount is made available.\nThe Fund Securities and Cash Amount are\nsubject to possible amendment or correction.\nFund Securities received on redemption may not\nbe identical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Unless cash\nredemptions are available or specified for a\nFund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit generally consist of Fund Securities,\nplus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal\nto the difference between the NAV of the\nshares being redeemed, as next determined\nafter the receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form, and the value of Fund Securities,\nless a redemption transaction fee (as\ndescribed below). The Trust may, in its sole\ndiscretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally\nredeems Creation Units for Fund Securities,\nbut each Fund reserves the right to utilize a\ncash option for redemption of Creation Units.\nEach Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide\nsuch redeeming Authorized Participant a\nportfolio of securities that differs from the\nexact composition of the Fund Securities, but\ndoes not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket\nmay also be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index\nrebalance to reflect revisions that account\nfor index additions, deletions, and re-\nweights. Cash Redemption Method. Although the\nTrust does not generally permit partial or\nfull cash redemptions of Creation Units of its\nfunds, when partial or full cash redemptions\nof Creation Units are available or specified\nfor a Fund, they will be effected in\nessentially the same manner as in-kind\nredemptions thereof. In the case of partial or\nfull cash redemption, the Authorized\nParticipant receives the cash equivalent of\nthe Fund Securities it would otherwise receive\nthrough an in-kind redemption, plus the same\nCash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\niShares China Large-Cap ETF, iShares\nInternational Equity Factor ETF, iShares\nInternational Small-Cap Equity Factor ETF,\niShares MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares MSCI EAFE\nGrowth ETF, iShares MSCI EAFE Min Vol Factor\nETF, iShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap ETF, iShares\nMSCI EAFE Value ETF, iShares MSCI Europe\nFinancials ETF, iShares MSCI Europe Small-Cap\nETF, iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF,\niShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor ETF and\niShares MSCI Intl Value Factor ETF A standard\nredemption transaction fee is imposed to\noffset transfer and other transaction costs\nthat may be incurred by the relevant Fund. The\nstandard redemption transaction fee is charged\nto the Authorized Participant on the day such\nAuthorized Participant redeems a Creation\nUnit, and is the same regardless of the number\nof Creation Units redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant on the applicable Business Day. In\norder to defray transaction expenses for a\nFund and protect against possible shareholder\ndilution, if a redemption transaction consists\nsolely or partially of cash, the Authorized\nParticipant may also be required to cover (up\nto the maximum\n\n116\n\namount shown below) certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution and other costs\nand expenses related to the execution of\ntrades resulting from such transaction (which\nmay, in certain instances, be based on a good\nfaith estimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread between the expected bid\nand offer side of the market and anticipated\nmarket impact). However, a Fund is not\nobligated to trade identical securities to the\nsecurities identified by BlackRock in\nestimating these transaction and other costs\nand expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or\nan affiliate may determine in its discretion\nto deviate from the regular charge, subject to\nthe maximum amounts shown below.

As described\nabove, under an ETF Services Agreement, the\nFunds have retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA,\nto perform certain ETF Services. BRIL will\nreceive from an Authorized Participant a\nstandard transaction fee on each redemption\norder, which consists of (1) the ETF Servicing\nFee and (2) Custody Transaction Costs. BRIL is\nentitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee\npursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but\nBRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction\nCosts to the applicable Fund custodian\naccording to the amounts invoiced by such\ncustodian. The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee\nper order regardless of the number of Creation\nUnits being redeemed, which amount will vary\namong different Funds based on a number of\nfactors, including the complexity of the order\nand the types of securities or instruments\nincluded in a Fund\u2019s Redemption Basket, among\nother variables. The actual Custody\nTransaction Costs vary per order based on the\nnumber of trades, underlying markets, and\nsettlement locations associated with the\nredemption of a Creation Unit. The following\ntable sets forth, for each Fund, either the\nactual standard redemption transaction fee\nthat was charged on October 31, 2024 or an\nestimate of the standard redemption\ntransaction fee that would have been charged\nif the Fund had redeemed a Creation Unit on\nthat date. The actual fee that was or would\nhave been charged to an Authorized Participant\nin connection with a redemption order will\nvary over time depending on the factors\ndiscussed above, and may be higher than the\nfee set forth below.\n\n117\n\nIn order to defray transaction expenses for a\nFund and protect against possible shareholder\ndilution, if a redemption transaction consists\nsolely or partially of cash, the Authorized\nParticipant may also be required to cover (up\nto the maximum amount shown below) certain\nbrokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution\nand other costs and expenses related to the\nexecution of trades resulting from such\ntransaction (which may, in certain instances,\nbe based on a good faith estimate of\ntransaction costs based on historical data or\nother inputs, at BlackRock\u2019s discretion, and\nmay include part or all of the spread between\nthe expected bid and offer side of the market\nand anticipated market impact). However, a\nFund is not obligated to trade identical\nsecurities to the securities identified by\nBlackRock in estimating these transaction and\nother costs and expenses. In certain cases,\nBlackRock or an affiliate may determine in its\ndiscretion to deviate from the regular charge,\nsubject to the maximum amounts shown below.\nAuthorized Participants will also bear the\ncosts of transferring the Fund Securities from\na Fund to their account on their order.\nCertain fees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances.

Redemption\nrequests for Creation Units of the Funds must\nbe submitted to the Distributor or its agent\nby or through an Authorized Participant. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable request to redeem shares of a Fund\ngenerally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on\nany Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, a Fund may require\norders to redeem Creation Units to be placed\nearlier that day. Investors, other than\nAuthorized Participants, are responsible for\nmaking arrangements for a redemption request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. The Authorized Participant must\ntransmit the request for redemption in the\nform required by the Funds to the Distributor\nor its agent in accordance with procedures set\nforth in the Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that,\ntherefore, requests to redeem Creation Units\nmay have to be placed by the investor's broker\nthrough an Authorized Participant who has\nexecuted an Authorized Participant Agreement.\nAt any time, only a limited number of broker-\ndealers will have an Authorized Participant\nAgreement in effect. Investors making a\nredemption request should be aware that such\nrequest must be in the form specified by such\nAuthorized Participant. Investors making a\nrequest to redeem Creation Units should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe request by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Funds'\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the applicable\nFund is received by the Distributor or its\nagent from the Authorized Participant\n\n118\n\non behalf of itself or another redeeming\ninvestor within the time periods specified\nabove; and (iii) all other procedures set\nforth in the Authorized Participant Agreement\nare properly followed. Upon receiving a\nredemption request, the Distributor or its\nagent shall notify the applicable Fund and the\nFund's transfer agent of such redemption\nrequest. The tender of an investor's shares\nfor redemption and the distribution of the\nsecurities and/or cash included in the\nredemption payment made in respect of Creation\nUnits redeemed will be made through DTC and\nthe relevant Authorized Participant to the\nBeneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the\nbook-entry system of DTC or the DTC\nParticipant through which such investor holds,\nas the case may be, or by such other means\nspecified by the Authorized Participant\nsubmitting the redemption request. A redeeming\nAuthorized Participant, whether on its own\naccount or acting on behalf of a Beneficial\nOwner, must maintain appropriate security\narrangements with a qualified broker-dealer,\nbank or other custody providers in each\njurisdiction in which any of the portfolio\nsecurities are customarily traded, to which\naccount such portfolio securities will be\ndelivered. For the iShares ESG MSCI USA Min\nVol Factor ETF, iShares MSCI USA Min Vol\nFactor ETF, iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor\nETF, iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF,\niShares MSCI USA Size Factor ETF, iShares MSCI\nUSA Small-Cap Min Vol Factor ETF, iShares MSCI\nUSA Value Factor ETF, iShares U.S. Equity\nFactor ETF, iShares U.S. Small-Cap Equity\nFactor ETF and iShares U.S. Tech Breakthrough\nMultisector ETF, deliveries of redemption\nproceeds are generally made within one\nBusiness Day (i.e., \u201c T+1 \u201d ). For the iShares\nChina Large-Cap ETF, iShares International\nEquity Factor ETF, iShares International\nSmall-Cap Equity Factor ETF, iShares MSCI EAFE\nETF, iShares MSCI EAFE Growth ETF, iShares\nMSCI EAFE Min Vol Factor ETF, iShares MSCI\nEAFE Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI EAFE Value\nETF, iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF,\niShares MSCI Europe Small-Cap ETF, iShares\nMSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, iShares MSCI\nIntl Quality Factor ETF and iShares MSCI Intl\nValue Factor ETF, deliveries of redemption\nproceeds are generally made within two\nBusiness Days (i.e., \u201c T+2 \u201d ). However, each\nFund reserves the right to settle redemption\ntransactions on a different basis, if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. These circumstances may include, among\nothers, accommodating non-U.S. market holiday\nschedules and accounting for different\ntreatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of\ndividend record dates and dividend ex-dates\n(i.e., the last date the holder of a security\ncan sell the security and still receive\ndividends payable on the security). If neither\nthe Authorized Participant nor the Beneficial\nOwner on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting has appropriate\narrangements to take delivery of Fund\nSecurities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in\nits discretion exercise its option to redeem\nsuch shares in cash, and the Beneficial Owner\nwill be required to receive its redemption\nproceeds in cash. In such case, the investor\nwill receive a cash payment equal to the net\nasset value of its shares based on the NAV of\nthe relevant Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charges specified above to offset\nthe Fund's brokerage and other transaction\ncosts associated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and each Fund (whether or not it\notherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves\nthe right to redeem Creation Units for cash to\nthe extent that the Fund cannot lawfully\ndeliver specific Fund Securities upon\nredemptions or cannot do so without first\nregistering the Fund Securities under such\nlaws. Although the Trust does not ordinarily\npermit cash redemptions of Creation Units, in\nthe event that cash redemptions are permitted\nor required by the Trust, proceeds will be\npaid to the Authorized Participant redeeming\nshares as soon as practicable after the date\nof redemption (within seven calendar days\nthereafter). If a Fund includes a foreign\ninvestment in its basket, and if a local\nmarket holiday, or series of consecutive\nholidays, or the extended delivery cycles for\ntransferring foreign investments to redeeming\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of the foreign investment in response\nto a redemption request, the Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if the Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant's\nagreement with the Distributor or its agent,\nin the event an Authorized Participant has\nsubmitted a redemption request in proper form\nbut is unable to transfer all or part of the\nCreation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or\nprior to the time specified by the Fund or its\ncustodian on the Business Day after the date\nof submission of such redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be\n\n119\n\nsecured by the Authorized Participant's\ndelivery and maintenance of collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. Such collateral must be\ndelivered no later than the time specified by\na Fund or its custodian on the Business Day\nafter the date of submission of such\nredemption request and shall be held by State\nStreet, Citibank or JPMorgan, as applicable,\nand marked-to-market daily. The fees of State\nStreet, Citibank or JPMorgan, as applicable,\nand any sub-custodians in respect of the\ndelivery, maintenance and redelivery of the\ncollateral shall be payable by the Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement permits the Funds to acquire shares\nof the Funds at any time and subjects the\nAuthorized Participant to liability for any\nshortfall between the aggregate of the cost to\nthe Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the\nvalue of the Cash Amount, and the value of the\ncollateral together with liability for related\nbrokerage and other charges. Because the\nportfolio securities of a Fund may trade on\nexchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange\nis closed or are otherwise not Business Days\nfor such Fund, shareholders may not be able to\nredeem their shares of such Fund or purchase\nor sell shares of such Fund on the Listing\nExchange on days when the NAV of such a Fund\ncould be significantly affected by events in\nthe relevant non-U.S. markets. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of\npayment postponed with respect to any Fund:\n(i) for any period during which the applicable\nListing Exchange is closed (other than\ncustomary weekend and holiday closings); (ii)\nfor any period during which trading on the\napplicable Listing Exchange is suspended or\nrestricted; (iii) for any period during which\nan emergency exists as a result of which\ndisposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio\nsecurities or determination of its NAV is not\nreasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and each Fund may accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\na Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. Each Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of a Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of a Fund may be taken into\naccount. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for each Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Funds, as set forth in each\nFund's policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets.\n\n120\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of a Fund.\nThis summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to a Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Regulated Investment\nCompany Qualifications. Each Fund intends to\nqualify for treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) (and 90% of net tax-exempt\nincome for each of the iShares MSCI EAFE Min\nVol Factor ETF and iShares MSCI USA Min Vol\nFactor ETF), and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of each\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of each\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of each Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of each\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. A Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests\nand does not timely cure the failure, that\nFund will be taxed in the same manner as an\nordinary corporation and distributions to its\nshareholders will not be deductible by that\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. A\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, a Fund must\ndistribute to its shareholders at least the\nsum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than the\nexcess of its net realized long-term capital\ngain over its net realized short-term capital\nloss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and\n(ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the\ntaxable year. A Fund will be subject to income\ntax at regular corporate rates on any taxable\nincome or gains that it does not distribute to\nits shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify\nfor any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet\nthe distribution requirement, all of its\ntaxable income will be subject to tax at\nregular corporate income tax rates without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand such distributions generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends\nto the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although\neach Fund intends to distribute substantially\nall of its net investment income and its\ncapital gains for each taxable year, a Fund\nmay decide to retain a portion of its income\nor gains if the Fund determines that\n\n121\n\ndoing so is in the interest of its\nshareholders. Each Fund will be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation to the extent any\nsuch income or gains are not distributed. If a\nFund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it\nmust pay out its earnings and profits\naccumulated in that year in order to qualify\nagain as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as\na RIC for a period greater than two taxable\nyears, the Fund may be required to recognize\nany net built-in gains with respect to certain\nof its assets ( i.e., the excess of the\naggregate gains, including items of income,\nover aggregate losses that would have been\nrealized with respect to such assets if the\nFund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a\nRIC in a subsequent year. Excise Tax. A Fund\nwill be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by a Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. Each Fund intends to declare\nand distribute dividends and distributions in\nthe amounts and at the times necessary to\navoid the application of this 4% excise tax.\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards. Net capital\nloss carryforwards may be applied against any\nnet realized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that a Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. The following\nFunds had net capital loss carryforwards as\nset forth in the table below as of July 31,\n2024, the tax year-end for the Funds listed:\n                                              \n  Fund                   Non-ExpiringCapital  \n                            LossCarryforward  \n  iShares China               $4,065,806,628  \n  Large-Cap ETF                               \n  iShares ESG MSCI                            \n  USA Min Vol                        491,613  \n  FactorETF                                   \n  iShares                                     \n  International                  162,940,407  \n  Equity Factor ETF                           \n  iShares                                     \n  International                   13,329,180  \n  Small-Cap                                   \n  EquityFactor ETF                            \n  iShares MSCI EAFE            8,819,287,179  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI EAFE            1,377,449,217  \n  Growth ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI EAFE              984,937,639  \n  Min Vol Factor ETF                          \n  iShares MSCI EAFE              884,211,082  \n  Small-Cap ETF                               \n  iShares MSCI EAFE            1,130,024,311  \n  Value ETF                                   \n  iShares MSCI Europe            218,142,185  \n  Financials ETF                              \n  iShares MSCI Europe             22,424,410  \n  Small-Cap ETF                               \n  iShares MSCI Intl              132,143,066  \n  Momentum FactorETF                          \n  iShares MSCI Intl              244,931,469  \n  Quality Factor ETF                          \n  iShares MSCI Intl               76,001,038  \n  Value Factor ETF                            \n  iShares MSCI USA             2,772,795,428  \n  Min Vol Factor ETF                          \n  iShares MSCI USA             3,651,093,524  \n  Momentum FactorETF                          \n  iShares MSCI USA             1,700,911,469  \n  Quality Factor ETF                          \n  iShares MSCI USA                68,187,873  \n  Size Factor ETF                             \n  iShares MSCI USA                            \n  Small-Cap Min               133,073,349.00  \n  VolFactor ETF                               \n  iShares MSCI USA               935,509,785  \n  Value Factor ETF                            \n  iShares U.S. Equity          78,694,795.00  \n  Factor ETF                                  \n  iShares U.S.                                \n  Small-Cap Equity             89,031,369.00  \n  Factor ETF                                  \n                                              \n122\n                                              \n  Fund                   Non-ExpiringCapital  \n                            LossCarryforward  \n  iShares U.S. Tech                           \n  BreakthroughMultis\u2026          25,845,953.00  \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nTaxation of U.S. Shareholders. Dividends and\nother distributions by a Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by a Fund in\nOctober, November or December of any calendar\nyear and payable to shareholders of record on\na specified date in such a month shall be\ndeemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. Each\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if a Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\na Fund reports as capital gains dividends are\ntaxable as long-term capital gains, whether\npaid in cash or in shares and regardless of\nhow long a shareholder has held shares of the\nFund. All other dividends of a Fund (including\ndividends from short-term capital gains) from\nits current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits ( \u201c regular dividends \u201d ) are\ngenerally subject to tax as ordinary income,\nsubject to the discussion of qualified\ndividend income below. Long-term capital gains\nare eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of\n15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders,\ndepending on whether their income exceeds\ncertain threshold amounts. If an individual\nreceives a regular dividend qualifying for the\nlong-term capital gains rates and such\ndividend constitutes an \u201c extraordinary\ndividend, \u201d and the individual subsequently\nrecognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of\nstock in respect of which the extraordinary\ndividend was paid, then the loss will be long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of such\nextraordinary dividend. An \u201c extraordinary\ndividend \u201d on common stock for this purpose is\ngenerally a dividend (i) in an amount greater\nthan or equal to 10% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax\nbasis (or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount\ngreater than 20% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax basis\n(or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin a 365-day period. Distributions in\nexcess of a Fund\u2019s current and accumulated\nearnings and profits will, as to each\nshareholder, be treated as a tax-free return\nof capital to the extent of a shareholder\u2019s\nbasis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital\ngain thereafter (if the shareholder holds\nshares of the Fund as capital assets).\nDistributions in excess of a Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but not in excess\nof a Fund\u2019s earnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will not\nconstitute nontaxable returns of capital.\nShareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on net investment\nincome, including, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates and trusts.\n\n123\n\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution may nevertheless be\ntaxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of\nrecord of any security on the record date for\nany dividends payable with respect to such\nsecurity, such dividends will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income not as of the date\nreceived but as of the later of (a) the date\nsuch security became ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividends ( i.e. , the date on which a\nbuyer of the security would not be entitled to\nreceive the declared, but unpaid, dividends);\nor (b) the date the Fund acquired such\nsecurity. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its\nincome distribution requirements, a Fund may\nbe required to pay dividends based on\nanticipated earnings, and shareholders may\nreceive dividends in an earlier year than\nwould otherwise be the case. In certain\nsituations, a Fund may, for a taxable year,\ndefer all or a portion of its net capital loss\n(or if there is no net capital loss, then any\nnet long-term or short-term capital loss)\nrealized after October and its late-year\nordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the\nexcess of post-October foreign currency and\npassive foreign investment company ( \u201c PFIC \u201d\n) losses over post-October foreign currency\nand PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-\nDecember ordinary losses over post-December\nordinary income) until the next taxable year\nin computing its investment company taxable\nincome and net capital gain, which will defer\nthe recognition of such realized losses. Such\ndeferrals and other rules regarding gains and\nlosses realized after October (or December)\nmay affect the tax character of shareholder\ndistributions. Sales of Shares. Upon the sale\nor exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder\nwill realize a taxable gain or loss equal to\nthe difference between the amount realized and\nthe shareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund.\nA redemption of shares by a Fund will be\ntreated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain\nor loss will be treated as capital gain or\nloss if the shares are capital assets in the\nshareholder\u2019s hands and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor more than one year and short-term capital\ngain or loss if the shares are held for one\nyear or less. Any loss realized on a sale or\nexchange will be disallowed to the extent the\nshares disposed of are replaced, including\nreplacement through the reinvesting of\ndividends or capital gains distributions, or\nby an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of a Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, a Fund will be required to withhold at\na 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such\namounts withheld from any distributions paid\nto a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability. Sections 351 and 362. The Trust, on\nbehalf of each Fund, has the right to reject\nan order for a purchase of shares of the Fund\nif the purchaser (or group of purchasers)\nwould, upon obtaining the shares so ordered,\nown 80% or more of the outstanding shares of a\ngiven Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351\nand 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that\nFund would have a basis in the securities\ndifferent from the market value of such\nsecurities on the date of deposit. If a Fund\u2019s\nbasis in such securities on the date of\ndeposit was less than market value on such\ndate, the Fund, upon disposition of the\nsecurities, would recognize more taxable gain\nor less taxable loss than if its basis in the\nsecurities had been equal to market value. It\nis not anticipated that the Trust will\nexercise the right of rejection except in a\ncase where the Trust determines that accepting\nthe order could result in material adverse tax\nconsequences to a Fund or its shareholders.\nThe Trust also has the right to require\ninformation necessary to determine beneficial\nshare ownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination.\n\n124\n\nTaxation of Certain Derivatives. A Fund\u2019s\ntransactions in zero coupon securities,\nnon-U.S. currencies, forward contracts,\noptions and futures contracts (including\noptions and futures contracts on non-U.S.\ncurrencies), to the extent permitted, will be\nsubject to special provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code (including provisions relating to\n\u201c hedging transactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d )\nthat, among other consequences, may affect the\ncharacter of gains and losses realized by the\nFund ( i.e. , may affect whether gains or\nlosses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer\nFund losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also (a) will require a Fund to\nmark-to-market certain types of the positions\nin its portfolio ( i.e. , treat them as if\nthey were closed out at the end of each year)\nand (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income\nwithout receiving cash with which to pay\ndividends or make distributions in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\ntaxes. Each Fund will monitor its\ntransactions, will make the appropriate tax\nelections and will make the appropriate\nentries in its books and records when it\nacquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S.\ncurrency, forward contract, option, futures\ncontract or hedged investment in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and prevent\ndisqualification of a Fund as a RIC. A Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in so-called \u201c Section 1256\ncontracts, \u201d such as regulated futures\ncontracts, most non-U.S. currency forward\ncontracts traded in the interbank market and\noptions on most security indexes, are subject\nto special tax rules. All Section 1256\ncontracts held by a Fund at the end of its\ntaxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in a\nFund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by a Fund from positions in Section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by a Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, a Fund may make\nor receive periodic net payments. A Fund may\nalso make or receive a payment when a swap is\nterminated prior to maturity through an\nassignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if a Fund has been a party to the swap\nfor more than one year). With respect to\ncertain types of swaps, a Fund may be required\nto currently recognize income or loss with\nrespect to future payments on such swaps or\nmay elect under certain circumstances to mark\nsuch swaps to market annually for tax purposes\nas ordinary income or loss. Qualified Dividend\nIncome. Distributions by a Fund of investment\ncompany taxable income (including any short-\nterm capital gains), whether received in cash\nor shares, will be taxable either as ordinary\nincome or as qualified dividend income, which\nis eligible to be taxed at long-term capital\ngain rates to the extent a Fund receives\nqualified dividend income on the securities it\nholds and a Fund reports the distribution as\nqualified dividend income. Qualified dividend\nincome is, in general, dividend income from\ntaxable U.S. corporations (but generally not\nfrom U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S.\ncorporations ( e.g. , non-U.S. corporations\nthat are not PFICs and which are incorporated\nin a possession of the U.S. or in certain\ncountries with a comprehensive tax treaty with\nthe U.S., or the stock of which is readily\ntradable on an established securities market\nin the U.S. (where the dividends are paid with\nrespect to such stock)). Under current IRS\nguidance, the U.S. has appropriate\ncomprehensive income tax treaties with the\nfollowing countries: Australia, Austria,\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria,\nCanada, Chile, China (but not with Hong Kong,\nwhich is treated as a separate jurisdiction\nfor U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech\nRepublic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India,\nIndonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica,\nJapan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania,\nLuxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan,\nthe Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania,\nthe Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa,\nSouth Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago,\nTunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and\nVenezuela. Substitute payments received by a\nFund for securities lent out by a Fund will\nnot be qualified dividend income. A dividend\nfrom a Fund will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income to the extent that: (i) the\nshareholder has not held the shares on which\nthe dividend was paid for 61 days during the\n121-day period that begins on the date that is\n60 days before the date on which the shares\nbecome ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe securities it holds that paid the\ndividends distributed to the shareholder (or,\nin the case of certain preferred stocks, the\nholding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) a Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a\nFund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated\n\n125\n\nas qualified dividend income only to the\nextent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by a Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by a Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by a Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify\nfor the U.S. federal dividends received\ndeduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum\nholding period during the 90-day period that\nbegins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or\n91-day minimum holding period during the 180\nperiod beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend\ndate for certain preference dividends) during\nwhich risk of loss may not be diminished is\nrequired for the applicable shares, at both\nthe Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend\nto be eligible for the dividends received\ndeduction. Restrictions may apply if\nindebtedness, including a short sale, is\nattributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Funds\nserve to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by\ntheir tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a\nFund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-\nfinanced property in the hands of the tax-\nexempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by a Fund\nfrom REITs, real estate mortgage investment\nconduits, taxable mortgage pools or other\ninvestments may cause the Fund to report some\nor all of its distributions as \u201c excess\ninclusion income. \u201d To Fund shareholders, such\nexcess inclusion income may: (i) constitute\ntaxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders\nwho would otherwise be tax-exempt such as\nindividual retirement accounts, 401(k)\naccounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and\ncertain charitable entities; (ii) not be\noffset by otherwise allowable deductions for\ntax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for\nreduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S.\nshareholders even from tax treaty countries;\nand (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax\nif certain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust. A Fund tries to avoid\ninvesting in REITs that are expected to\ngenerate excess inclusion income, but a Fund\nmay not always be successful in doing so.\nBecause information about a REIT\u2019s investments\nmay be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a\nREIT may change its investment program, a Fund\nmay not be successful in avoiding the\nconsequences described above. Avoidance of\ninvestments in REITs that generate excess\ninclusion income may require a Fund to forego\notherwise attractive investment opportunities.\nNon-U.S. Investments. Under Section 988 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, gains or losses\nattributable to fluctuations in exchange rates\nbetween the time a Fund accrues income or\nreceivables or expenses or other liabilities\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency and the\ntime a Fund actually collects such income or\npays such liabilities are generally treated as\nordinary income or ordinary loss. In general,\ngains (and losses) realized on debt\ninstruments will be treated as Section 988\ngain (or loss) to the extent attributable to\nchanges in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and the currencies in which the\ninstruments are denominated. Similarly, gains\nor losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S.\ncurrency forward contracts and certain\nnon-U.S. currency options or futures contracts\ndenominated in non-U.S. currency, to the\nextent attributable to fluctuations in\nexchange rates between the acquisition and\ndisposition dates, are also treated as\nordinary income or loss unless a Fund was to\nelect otherwise. Each Fund may be subject to\nnon-U.S. income taxes withheld at the source.\nEach Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to\n\u201c pass through \u201d to its investors the amount\nof non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund\nprovided that the Fund held the security on\nthe dividend settlement date and for at least\n15 additional days immediately before and/or\nthereafter, with the result that each investor\nwith respect to shares of the Fund held for a\nminimum 16-day holding period at the time of\ndeemed distribution will (i) include in gross\nincome, even though not actually received, the\ninvestor\u2019s pro rata share of the Fund\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct\n(in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only\nfor investors who itemize their deductions on\ntheir personal tax returns) or credit (in\ncalculating U.S. federal income tax) the\ninvestor\u2019s pro rata share of the Fund\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on\ndividends on non-U.S. securities while such\nsecurities are lent out by a Fund are not\neligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through.\nTaxes not \u201c passed through \u201d for tax purposes\nwill not be available to\n\n126\n\nshareholders for foreign tax credit purposes.\nA non-U.S. person invested in a Fund in a year\nthat the Fund elects to \u201c pass through \u201d its\nnon-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving\nadditional dividend income subject to U.S.\nwithholding tax. A non-U.S. tax credit may not\nexceed the investor\u2019s U.S. federal income tax\notherwise payable with respect to the\ninvestor\u2019s non-U.S. source income. For this\npurpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S.\nsource gross income (i) their proportionate\nshares of non-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and\n(ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the\nFund that represents income derived from\nnon-U.S. sources; the Fund\u2019s gain from the\nsale of securities will generally be treated\nas U.S.-source income. Certain limitations\nwill be imposed to the extent to which the\nnon-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your\nFund shares are loaned pursuant to securities\nlending arrangements, you may lose the ability\nto use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through\nby a Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid\nwhile the shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\nwith respect to shares of a Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. Certain of the Funds have filed\nrefund claims in various EU countries to\nrecover taxes withheld on dividend income\nreceived during past years based upon certain\nprovisions in the Treaty on the Functioning of\nthe EU. Whether or when a Fund will receive a\ntax refund is within the control of the\nindividual country. Pending confirmatory\nguidance from the IRS, the refunds received\nmay reduce a Fund\u2019s pass-through of foreign\ntax credits in such year and potentially\nfuture years or may result in the Funds paying\nan IRS compliance fee to cover the effect of\nthe tax credits previously passed through to\nshareholders on refunded foreign taxes.\nPassive Foreign Investment Companies. If a\nFund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on a\nportion of any \u201c excess distribution \u201d or gain\nfrom the disposition of such shares even if\nsuch income is distributed as a taxable\ndividend by the Fund to its shareholders.\nAdditional charges in the nature of interest\nmay be imposed on the Fund in respect of\ndeferred taxes arising from such distributions\nor gains. If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC\nand elect to treat the PFIC as a \u201c qualified\nelecting fund \u201d under the Internal Revenue\nCode, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, a\nFund might be required to include in income\neach year a portion of the ordinary earnings\nand net capital gains of the qualified\nelecting fund, even if not distributed to a\nFund, and such amounts would be subject to the\n90% and excise tax distribution requirements\ndescribed above. In order to make this\nelection, a Fund would be required to obtain\ncertain annual information from the PFICs in\nwhich it invests, which may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain. Alternatively, a Fund\nmay make a mark-to-market election that would\nresult in a Fund being treated as if it had\nsold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end\nof each year. In such case, a Fund would\nreport any such gains as ordinary income and\nwould deduct any such losses as ordinary\nlosses to the extent of previously recognized\ngains. The election must be made separately\nfor each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made,\nwould be effective for all subsequent taxable\nyears, unless revoked with the consent of the\nIRS. By making the election, a Fund could\npotentially ameliorate the adverse tax\nconsequences with respect to its ownership of\nshares in a PFIC, but in any particular year\nmay be required to recognize income in excess\nof the distributions it receives from PFICs\nand its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC\nstock. A Fund may have to distribute this \u201c\nphantom \u201d income and gain to satisfy the 90%\ndistribution requirement and to avoid\nimposition of the 4% excise tax. A Fund will\nmake the appropriate tax elections, if\npossible, and take any additional steps that\nare necessary to mitigate the effects of these\nrules. Reporting. If a shareholder recognizes\na loss with respect to a Fund\u2019s shares of $2\nmillion or more for an individual shareholder\nor $10 million or more for a corporate\nshareholder, the shareholder must file with\nthe IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form\n8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio\nsecurities are in many cases exempted from\nthis reporting requirement, but under current\nguidance, shareholders of a RIC are not\nexempted. The fact that a loss is reportable\nunder these regulations does not affect the\nlegal determination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally\n\n127\n\nnot subject to such withholding tax. In order\nto obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a\nnon-U.S. shareholder will be required to\nprovide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to\nbenefits under a treaty. The withholding tax\ndoes not apply to regular dividends paid to a\nnon-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form\nW-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are\neffectively connected with the non-U.S.\nshareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business\nwithin the U.S. Instead, the effectively\nconnected dividends will be subject to regular\nU.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder\nwere a U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S.\ncorporation receiving effectively connected\ndividends may also be subject to additional \u201c\nbranch profits tax \u201d imposed at a rate of 30%\n(or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS\nForm W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be\nsubject to backup withholding at the\nappropriate rate. Properly-reported dividends\nare generally exempt from U.S. federal\nwithholding tax where they (i) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net interest\nincome \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S. source\ninterest income, other than certain contingent\ninterest and interest from obligations of a\ncorporation or partnership in which the Fund\nis at least a 10% shareholder or partner,\nreduced by expenses that are allocable to such\nincome) or (ii) are paid in respect of the\nFund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term capital gains \u201d\n(generally, the excess of the Fund\u2019s net\nshort-term capital gain over the Fund\u2019s long-\nterm capital loss for such taxable year).\nHowever, depending on its circumstances, the\nFund may report all, some or none of its\npotentially eligible dividends as such\nqualified net interest income or as qualified\nshort-term capital gains and/or treat such\ndividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible\nfor this exemption from withholding. In order\nto qualify for this exemption from\nwithholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will need\nto comply with applicable certification\nrequirements relating to its non-U.S. status\n(including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form).\nIn the case of shares held through an\nintermediary, the intermediary may withhold\neven if the Fund reports the payment as\nqualified net interest income or qualified\nshort-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders\nshould contact their intermediaries with\nrespect to the application of these rules to\ntheir accounts. Special rules may apply to a\nforeign shareholder receiving a Fund\ndistribution if at least 50% of the Fund's\nassets consist of interests in U.S. real\nproperty interests, including certain REITs\nand U.S. real property holding corporations\n(as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and\nTreasury regulations). Fund distributions that\nare attributable to gain from the disposition\nof a U.S. real property interest will be\ntaxable as ordinary dividends and subject to\nwithholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if\nthe foreign shareholder held no more than 5%\nof the Fund's shares at any time during the\none-year period ending on the date of the\ndistribution. If the foreign shareholder held\nat least 5% of the Fund's shares, the\ndistribution would be treated as income\neffectively connected with a trade or business\nwithin the U.S. and the foreign shareholder\nwould be subject to withholding tax at a rate\nof 21% and would generally be required to file\na U.S. federal income tax return. Similar\nconsequences would generally apply to a\nforeign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund\nshares unless the Fund is domestically\ncontrolled (meaning that more than 50% of the\nvalue of the Fund's shares is held by U.S.\nshareholders) or the foreign shareholder owns\nno more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any\ntime during the five-year period ending on the\ndate of sale. Finally, a domestically\ncontrolled Fund may be required to recognize a\nportion of its gain on the in-kind\ndistribution of certain U.S. real property\ninterests. Shareholders that are nonresident\naliens or foreign entities are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors concerning the\nparticular tax consequences to them of an\ninvestment in the Fund. The rules laid out in\nthe previous two paragraphs, other than the\nwithholding rules, will apply notwithstanding\na Fund's participation in a wash sale\ntransaction or its payment of a substitute\ndividend. Shareholders that are nonresident\naliens or foreign entities are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors concerning the\nparticular tax consequences to them of an\ninvestment in a Fund. Separately, a 30%\nwithholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to: (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address,\n\n128\n\nand taxpayer identification number of each\nsubstantial U.S. owner or provide\ncertifications of no substantial U.S.\nownership unless certain exceptions apply.\nShares of a Fund held by a non-U.S.\nshareholder at death will be considered\nsituated within the U.S. and subject to the\nU.S. estate tax. The foregoing discussion is a\nsummary of certain material U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations only and is not\nintended as a substitute for careful tax\nplanning. Purchasers of shares should consult\ntheir own tax advisors as to the tax\nconsequences of investing in such shares,\nincluding consequences under state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the foregoing\ndiscussion is based on applicable provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code, regulations,\njudicial authority and administrative\ninterpretations in effect on the date of this\nSAI. Changes in applicable authority could\nmaterially affect the conclusions discussed\nabove, and such changes often occur.

The\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive\n( \u201c AIFMD \u201d ) imposes detailed and\nprescriptive obligations on fund managers\nestablished in the EU ( \u201c EU Operative\nProvisions \u201d ). These do not currently apply\nto managers established outside of the EU,\nsuch as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers are only\nrequired to comply with certain disclosure,\nreporting and transparency obligations of\nAIFMD ( \u201c AIFMD Disclosure Provisions \u201d ) if\nsuch managers market a fund to EU investors.\n\n129\n\nWhere the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate\nto EU Operative Provisions that do not apply\nto BFA, no meaningful disclosure can be made.\nThese EU Operative Provisions include\nprescriptive rules on: measuring and capping\nleverage in line with known European\nstandards; the treatment of investors; the use\nof \u201c depositaries \u201d ; and coverage for\nprofessional liability risks. AIFMD imposes\ncertain conditions on the marketing of funds,\nsuch as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD\nrequires that an \u2018alternative investment fund\nmanager\u2019 ( \u201c AIFM \u201d ) be identified to meet\nsuch conditions where such marketing is\nsought. For these purposes BFA, as the legal\nentity responsible for performing the\nportfolio and risk management of the Funds,\nshall be the AIFM. AIFMD requires disclosure\non an ongoing basis of certain information\nrelating to the use of special arrangements,\nleverage, rights of reuse of collateral,\nguarantees granted under leverage arrangements\nand the use of gates, side pockets and similar\nliquidity management tools. Given that the\nFunds do not use any special arrangements or\nallow for collateral reuse, it is not intended\nthat such disclosures will need to be made by\nthe Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the\nextent relevant and appropriate, disclose in\nits annual report information on the Fund's\nleverage, risk profile and risk management\nsystems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also\ndisclose material changes, if any, to the\nliquidity management systems and procedures\nemployed in respect of the Fund. BFA has\nregistered the following Funds for marketing\nto investors in the respective countries\nlisted below: iShares China Large-Cap ETF:\nFinland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the U.K.\niShares MSCI EAFE ETF: Finland, the\nNetherlands, Sweden and the U.K.\niShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap ETF: Finland,\nSweden, and the U.K. Investors\u2019 Rights. Each\nFund relies on the services of BFA and its\nother service providers, including the\nDistributor, administrator, custodian and\ntransfer agent. Further information about the\nduties and roles of these service providers is\nset out in this SAI. Investors who acquire\nshares of a Fund are not parties to the\nrelevant agreement with these service\nproviders and do not have express contractual\nrights against the Fund or its service\nproviders, except certain institutional\ninvestors that are Authorized Participants may\nhave certain express contractual rights with\nrespect to the Distributor under the terms of\nthe relevant Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors may have certain legal rights under\nfederal or state law against a Fund or its\nservice providers. In the event that an\ninvestor considers that it may have a claim\nagainst a Fund, or against any service\nprovider in connection with its investment in\na Fund, such investor should consult its own\nlegal advisor. By contract, Authorized\nParticipants irrevocably submit to the non-\nexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State\nor U.S. federal court sitting in New York City\nover any suit, action or proceeding arising\nout of or relating to the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Jurisdiction over other\nclaims, whether by investors or Authorized\nParticipants, will turn on the facts of the\nparticular case and the law of the\njurisdiction in which the proceeding is\nbrought.\n\n130\n\nAppendix A - iShares ETFs Proxy Voting\nPolicies Open-End Fund Proxy Voting Policy\nProcedures Governing Delegation of Proxy\nVoting to Fund Advisers Effective Date: August\n1, 2021 Last Review Date: August 25, 2023\nOpen-End Mutual Funds (including money market\nfunds) Exchange-Traded Funds Objective and\nScope Set forth below is the Open-End Fund\nProxy Voting Policy. Policy/Document\nRequirements and Statements The Boards of\nTrustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d ) of open-\nend funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d ) advised by\nBlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors,\nLLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ), have the responsibility\nfor the oversight of voting proxies relating\nto portfolio securities of the Funds, and have\ndetermined that it is in the best interests of\nthe Funds and their shareholders to delegate\nthe responsibility to vote proxies to\nBlackRock, subject to the principles outlined\nin this Policy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s\nauthority to manage, acquire and dispose of\naccount assets, all as contemplated by the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment management\nagreements.

We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals. We also publish a quarterly list of\nall companies with which we engaged and the\nkey topics addressed in the engagement\nmeeting. In this way, we help inform our\nclients about the work we do on their behalf\nin promoting the governance and business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\n11 The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.\n\nA-15\n\nIS-SAI-07-1124\n"
