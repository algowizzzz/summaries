  "text": "iShares \u00ae\n\niShares Trust\n\nSupplement dated December 23, 2024\n\nto the currently effective Statement of\nAdditional Information (the \u0093SAI\u0094) for the\n\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) (the \u0093Fund\u0094)\n\nThe\nfollowing changes for the Fund will be\neffective on January 1, 2025.\n                                              \n        The section of the SAI entitled       \n  1.    \u0093Proxy Voting Policy\u0094 is deleted in     \n        its entirety and replaced with the    \n        following:                            \n                                              \nThe Board of Trustees of iShares Trust (the\n\u0093Board\u0094) has approved a voting choice proxy\nvoting policy for the Fund (the \u0093Policy\u0094).\nUnder the Policy,\neligible Fund shareholders have the\nopportunity to select from among eight proxy\nvoting policies that include: 1) BlackRock\nInvestment Stewardship\u0092s Global Benchmark\nPolicy, comprised of the Global Principles for\nBenchmark Policies, regional\nvoting guidelines, and engagement priorities,\n(\u0093BFA\u0092s Proxy Voting Policy\u0094) and 2) various\nthird-party proxy voting policies (each, a\n\u0093Third-Party Proxy Voting Policy\u0094 and together\nwith BFA\u0092s Proxy Voting Policy, the\n\u0093IVV Proxy Voting Policies\u0094). BFA will\nadminister the Policy, will utilize the\napplicable IVV Proxy Voting Policy when\nselected by an eligible Fund shareholder (as\ndescribed below), and will be responsible for\nany interpretative questions\nin connection with the Policy and the\nutilization of a IVV Proxy Voting Policy,\nincluding the Third-Party Proxy Voting\nPolicies.\n\nOnce an IVV Proxy Voting Policy is\nselected by an eligible Fund shareholder, BFA\nwill apply it at the annual general\nshareholder meetings (\u0093AGMs\u0094) of issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund based on the Fund\nshareholder\u0092s proportional ownership of the\nFund as of the\nrecord date of the applicable AGM, subject to\ncertain exceptions described below. Once a\nFund shareholder makes an election, the\nselection will be retained and applied by the\nFund for the applicable account going forward\nso long as the applicable\nIVV Proxy Voting Policy is an available option\nunder the Policy or the shareholder makes a\ndifferent selection. If a Fund shareholder\ndoes not, or is unable to, select an IVV Proxy\nVoting Policy, BFA will continue to use BFA\u0092s\nProxy Voting\nPolicy for each such Fund shareholder\u0092s\nproportional ownership of the Fund. In\naddition, if the IVV Proxy Voting Policy is no\nlonger available under the Policy, the default\npolicy will be BFA\u0092s Proxy Voting Policy.\n\nShareholder Eligibility for the Policy\n\nBFA is working with Broadridge\nInvestor Communication Solutions Inc.\n(\u0093Broadridge\u0094) to identify and track known\nshareholder accounts in the Fund, which are\nreferred to as \u0093Eligible Shareholders.\u0094\nBroadridge will identify shareholder accounts\nthat are Eligible\nShareholders but will only do so for a\ncommunication in February using its network of\nbrokers to identify Fund shareholder\ninformation. Fund shareholder accounts that\nare not known to Broadridge or are not\naccounts at the time of the communications\nand shareholders that cannot be reached due to\nlimits on proxy voting infrastructure are not\nexpected to be eligible to select a Third-\nParty Proxy Voting Policy. Shareholders\npurchasing shares after February will not be\nEligible Shareholders until\nthe next annual communication. The Eligible\nShareholders will be notified by email or\nmail, as applicable under their current\npreferences to receive Fund proxy\ncommunications, and will be asked to\nparticipate in a survey to select from the IVV\nProxy\nVoting Polices by accessing a third-party\nservice provider\u0092s platform with the survey\ninformation. Please note that Eligible\nShareholders should retain the instructions\nfor accessing the survey as the Fund does not\nexpect to send additional\ninstructions to current Eligible Shareholders\nand, if the instructions are lost, Eligible\nShareholders will likely not be able to access\nthe survey to update the proxy voting\nselection, select a new proxy voting policy if\nadded, or to make any other\nchanges.\n\nShareholders that hold the Fund in multiple\nshareholder accounts may receive a survey\nrequest for each account identified by\nBroadridge and may only\nreceive the survey for certain accounts.\nShareholders should submit a response for each\nshareholder account.\n\nEligible Shareholders may also subsequently\nselect a\ndifferent IVV Proxy Voting Policy, from time\nto time, by accessing the survey through the\nprior communication they received. BFA will\nreview and implement initial and subsequent\nshareholder selections; provided that such\nselections will not be\nimplemented until\n\nafter all such reviews are complete. Eligible\nShareholders should expect a reasonable delay\nafter each selection is made before being\nimplemented. For Fund shareholders that choose\nnot to\nparticipate or are not eligible to\nparticipate, BFA will continue to vote the\nFund shareholder\u0092s proportional ownership of\nthe Fund pursuant to BFA\u0092s Proxy Voting\nPolicy. If BFA has invested another client\n(including a registered\ninvestment company) in the Fund, BFA will\nutilize BFA\u0092s Proxy Voting Policy as the\nclient\u0092s selection unless otherwise agreed\nbetween the client and BFA. BFA will not seek\nthe preferences of the investors in other\nregistered investment\ncompany clients.\n\nAdministration and Voting\n\nBFA has been delegated the\nresponsibility to administer the Policy and\nvote proxies for the Fund. BFA will cast votes\non behalf of the Fund on specific proxy issues\nin respect of securities held by the Fund (or\nmay refrain from voting) in accordance with\nthe IVV Proxy Voting\nPolicies at AGMs, subject to BFA\u0092s\ninterpretation of the IVV Proxy Voting\nPolices. The number of shares voted pursuant\nto each IVV Proxy Voting Policy will be based\non the pro rata ownership of Eligible\nShareholders that have selected such IVV\nProxy Voting Policy, calculated as of the\nrecord date for the applicable proxy for the\nunderlying security held by the Fund. BFA will\nrely on the information reasonably available\nto it to determine the percentages and\ncorresponding votes for the\nEligible Shareholders.\n\nBFA is authorized to use discretion in not\nvoting or limiting the use of a Third-Party\nProxy Voting Policy for certain underlying\nsecurities\nor certain proposals due to considerations\nincluding, but not limited to, cost,\noperational risk and/or complexity, local\nmarket regulation and practice, and financial\nconsiderations, including the decision not to\nrecall securities on loan by the\nFund. In addition, for corporate actions,\nspecial meetings such as in connection with\nmerger transactions or other change of control\ntransactions, voting in contested director\nelections, or other proxy issues where BFA has\ndetermined that a\nconsistent vote cast according to BFA\u0092s Proxy\nVoting Policy would be in the best interest of\nthe Fund as a whole, BFA will apply BFA\u0092s\nProxy Voting Policy.\n\nBFA will review proxy voting activity on\nbehalf of the Fund, including any voting\nconducted in accordance with a Third-Party\nProxy Voting Policy, to ensure that votes\nare cast in accordance with the Board\u0092s\ndelegation and applicable IVV Proxy Voting\nPolicy.\n\nIVV Proxy Voting Policies\n\nEligible Shareholders can select from the IVV\nProxy Voting Policies, which are listed below\nin alphabetical order and included as\nappendices:\n                                              \n  BlackR\u2026    Egan-Jo\u2026    Glass      ISS       \n                         Lewis                \n  BFA\u0092s                              Catholic  \n  Proxy      Wealth      Benchm\u2026    Faith-B\u2026  \n  Voting     Focused     Policy     Proxy     \n  Policy*    Policy      Guidel\u2026    Voting    \n                                    Guideli\u2026  \n                                    Global    \n                         Climate    Board-A\u2026  \n                         Policy     Proxy     \n                                    Voting    \n                                    Guideli\u2026  \n                                    Socially  \n                         Corpor\u2026    Respons\u2026  \n                         Govern\u2026    Investm\u2026  \n                         Focused    (SRI)     \n                         Policy     Proxy     \n                                    Voting    \n                                    Guideli\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       With respect to BFA\u0092s Proxy Voting      \n       Policy, the Global Principles are      \n  *    included as an appendix while the      \n       regional voting guidelines and         \n       engagement priorities are available    \n       upon request.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n        The section of each SAI entitled      \n  2.    \u0093Conflicts of Interest\u0094 shall be        \n        deleted in its entirety and replaced  \n        with the following:                   \n                                              \nConflicts of Interest. Certain activities of\nBlackRock, Inc., BlackRock Advisors, LLC,\nBlackRock Fund Advisors and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc.\n(collectively referred to in this section as\n\u0093BlackRock\u0094) and their respective directors,\nofficers or employees, with respect to the\nFunds and/or other accounts managed by\nBlackRock, may give rise to actual or\nperceived conflicts\nof interest such as those described below.\n\n2\n\nBlackRock is one of the world\u0092s largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective\ndirectors, officers and employees, including\nthe business units or entities and personnel\nwho may be involved in the investment\nactivities and business operations of a Fund,\nare engaged worldwide in businesses, including\nmanaging equities,\nfixed income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and other financial services, and\nhave interests other than that of managing the\nFunds. These are considerations of which\ninvestors in a Fund should be aware, and which\nmay cause\nconflicts of interest that could disadvantage\na Fund and its shareholders. These businesses\nand interests include potential multiple\nadvisory, transactional, financial and other\nrelationships with, or interests in companies\nand interests\nin securities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by a Fund.\n\nBlackRock has proprietary interests in, and\nmay manage or advise with respect to,\naccounts or funds (including separate accounts\nand other funds and collective investment\nvehicles) that have investment objectives\nsimilar to those of a Fund and/or that engage\nin transactions in the same types of\nsecurities, currencies\nand instruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also\na major participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is\nor may be actively engaged in transactions in\nthe same securities, currencies, and\ninstruments in which a Fund invests.\n\nSuch activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\na Fund\u0092s performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or\nclient accounts, will be executed\nindependently of a Fund\u0092s transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFund. In addition, the portfolio holdings of\ncertain BlackRock-advised\ninvestment vehicles managed in an identical or\nsubstantially similar manner as certain Funds\nare made publicly available on a more timely\nbasis than the applicable Fund. In some cases,\nsuch portfolio holdings are made publicly\navailable on\na daily basis. While not expected, it is\npossible that a recipient of portfolio\nholdings information for such an investment\nvehicle could cause harm to a Fund that is\nmanaged in an identical or substantially\nsimilar manner, including by\ntrading ahead of or against such Fund based on\nthe information received.\n\nWhen BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the\nsame assets for client accounts,\nincluding a Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets\npurchased or sold for a Fund. In addition,\ntransactions in investments by one or more\nother accounts managed by BlackRock may have\nthe effect of diluting or otherwise\ndisadvantaging the values, prices or\ninvestment strategies of a Fund,\nparticularly, but not limited to, with respect\nto small capitalization, emerging market or\nless liquid strategies. This may occur with\nrespect to BlackRock-advised accounts when\ninvestment decisions regarding a Fund are\nbased on research\nor other information that is also used to\nsupport decisions for other accounts. When\nBlackRock implements a portfolio decision or\nstrategy on behalf of another account ahead\nof, or contemporaneously with, similar\ndecisions\nor strategies for a Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the\nFund could otherwise be disadvantaged.\nBlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to\nimplement internal policies and procedures\ndesigned to limit such consequences, which may\ncause a Fund to be unable to engage in certain\nactivities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so.\n\nConflicts may also arise because portfolio\ndecisions regarding\na Fund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby a Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or\nits other accounts or funds, and the purchase\nof a security or covering of a short position\nin a security by a Fund may increase the price\nof the same security held by (and therefore\nbenefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or\nfunds.\n\nBlackRock, on behalf of other client accounts,\non the one hand, and a Fund, on the other\nhand, may invest in or extend credit to\ndifferent parts of the capital\nstructure of a single issuer. BlackRock may\npursue rights, provide advice or engage in\nother activities, or refrain from pursuing\nrights, providing\n\n3\n\nadvice or engaging in other activities, on\nbehalf of other clients with respect to an\nissuer in which a Fund has invested, and such\nactions (or refraining from action) may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Fund. In\nsituations in which clients of BlackRock\n(including the Funds) hold positions in\nmultiple parts of the capital structure of an\nissuer, BlackRock may not pursue certain\nactions or remedies that may be\navailable to a Fund, as a result of legal and\nregulatory requirements or otherwise.\nBlackRock addresses these and other potential\nconflicts of interest based on the facts and\ncircumstances of particular situations. For\nexample, BlackRock\nmay determine to rely on information barriers\nbetween different business units or portfolio\nmanagement teams. BlackRock may also determine\nto rely on the actions of similarly situated\nholders of loans or securities rather than, or\nin\nconnection with, taking such actions itself on\nbehalf of the Funds.\n\nIn addition, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, certain Funds may invest their\nassets in other funds advised by BlackRock,\nincluding funds that are managed by one or\nmore of the same portfolio managers, which\ncould result in conflicts of interest relating\nto asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases\nand redemptions,\nand increased remuneration and profitability\nfor BlackRock and/or its personnel, including\nportfolio managers.\n\nIn certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf\nof the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell\nsecurities to another fund or account advised\nby BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not\nrequired to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients (\u0093cross trades\u0094),\nincluding the\nFunds, if BlackRock believes such transactions\nare appropriate based on each party\u0092s\ninvestment objectives and guidelines, subject\nto applicable law and regulation. There may be\npotential conflicts of interest or regulatory\nissues\nrelating to these transactions which could\nlimit BlackRock\u0092s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such\ntransactions.\n\nBlackRock and its clients may pursue or\nenforce rights with respect to an issuer in\nwhich a Fund has invested, and those\nactivities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of\nthe Fund\u0092s investments may be negatively\nimpacted by the activities of BlackRock or its\nclients, and transactions for the Fund may be\nimpaired or\neffected at prices or terms that may be less\nfavorable than would otherwise have been the\ncase.\n\nThe results of a Fund\u0092s investment activities\nmay differ\nsignificantly from the results achieved by\nBlackRock for its proprietary accounts or\nother accounts (including investment companies\nor collective investment vehicles) that it\nmanages or advises. It is possible that one or\nmore accounts\nmanaged or advised by BlackRock and such other\naccounts will achieve investment results that\nare substantially more or less favorable than\nthe results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it\nis possible that a Fund will sustain losses\nduring\nperiods in which one or more proprietary or\nother accounts managed or advised by BlackRock\nachieve significant profits. The opposite\nresult is also possible.\n\nFrom time to time, a Fund may be restricted\nfrom purchasing or selling securities, or from\nengaging in other investment activities\nbecause of regulatory, legal or\ncontractual requirements applicable to\nBlackRock or other accounts managed or advised\nby BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of\nBlackRock designed to comply with such\nrequirements. As a result, there may be\nperiods, for example, when\nBlackRock will not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions in certain\nsecurities or instruments with respect to\nwhich BlackRock is performing services or when\nposition limits have been reached. For\nexample, the investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and accounts under its management may\nlimit the investment opportunities for a Fund\nin certain emerging and other markets in which\nlimitations are imposed upon the amount of\ninvestment,\nin the aggregate or in individual issuers, by\naffiliated foreign investors.\n\nIn connection with its management of a Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on behalf of a Fund in\naccordance with such analysis and models. In\naddition,\nBlackRock will not have any obligation to make\navailable any information regarding its\nproprietary activities or strategies, or the\nactivities or strategies used for other\naccounts managed by them, for the benefit of\nthe management of a\nFund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock\nwill have\n\n4\n\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the\nactivities or strategies used for accounts\nmanaged\nby BlackRock or other client accounts could\nconflict with the transactions and strategies\nemployed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.\n\nThe Funds may be\nincluded in investment models developed by\nBlackRock for use by clients and financial\nadvisors. To the extent clients invest in\nthese investment models and increase the\nassets under management of the Funds, the\ninvestment management fee\namounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may\nalso increase. The net asset value and\nliquidity of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by model-\ndriven investment portfolios, as well as by\nBlackRock itself and by its\nadvisory clients.\n\nIn addition, certain principals and certain\nemployees of a Fund\u0092s investment adviser are\nalso principals or employees of other business\nunits or entities within BlackRock. As a\nresult, these principals and employees may\nhave obligations to such other business units\nor entities or their clients and such\nobligations to other business units or\nentities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware.\n\nBlackRock may enter into transactions and\ninvest in securities, instruments and\ncurrencies on behalf of\na Fund in which clients of BlackRock, or, to\nthe extent permitted by the Commission and\napplicable law, BlackRock, serves as the\ncounterparty, principal or issuer. In such\ncases, such party\u0092s interests in the\ntransaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch\ninvestments by a Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock.\n\nBlackRock may also create, write or issue\nderivatives for clients, the underlying\nsecurities,\ncurrencies or instruments of which may be\nthose in which a Fund invests or which may be\nbased on the performance of the Fund.\nAdditionally, an affiliate of BlackRock will\ncreate, write or issue options, which may be\nbased on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares ETFs, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares\nETFs. Trading activity in these derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\ngreater liquidity for such products, increased\npurchase activity with respect to these\niShares ETFs and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. A Fund may,\nsubject to applicable law, purchase\ninvestments that are the subject of an\nunderwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse\nto those of the Fund. At times, these\nactivities may cause business units or\nentities within BlackRock to give advice to\nclients that may cause these clients to take\nactions adverse to the interests of the Fund.\nTo the extent such\ntransactions are permitted, a Fund will deal\nwith BlackRock on an arms-length basis.\n\nTo the extent authorized by applicable law,\nBlackRock may act as broker,\ndealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other\ncommercial capacities for a Fund. It is\nanticipated that the commissions, mark-ups,\nmark-downs, financial advisory fees,\nunderwriting and placement fees,\nsales fees, financing and commitment fees,\nbrokerage fees, other fees, compensation or\nprofits, rates, terms and conditions charged\nby BlackRock will be in its view commercially\nreasonable, although BlackRock, including its\nsales\npersonnel, will have an interest in obtaining\nfees and other amounts that are favorable to\nBlackRock and such sales personnel, which may\nhave an adverse effect on the Funds. Index\nbased funds may use an index provider that is\naffiliated\nwith another service provider of the Fund or\nBlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer,\nagent, lender or in other commercial\ncapacities for a Fund or BlackRock.\n\nSubject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its\npersonnel and other distributors) will be\nentitled to retain fees and other amounts that\nthey receive in connection\nwith their service to the Funds as broker,\ndealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other\ncommercial capacities. No accounting to the\nFunds or their shareholders will be required,\nand no fees or other compensation payable by\nthe Funds or their\nshareholders will be reduced by reason of\nreceipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other\namounts.\n\nWhen BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent,\nadviser or in\nother commercial capacities in relation to the\nFunds, BlackRock may take commercial steps in\nits own interests, which may have an adverse\neffect on the Funds. A Fund will be required\nto establish business relationships with its\ncounterparties\nbased on the\n\n5\n\nFund\u0092s own credit standing. BlackRock will not\nhave any obligation to allow its credit to be\nused in connection with a Fund\u0092s establishment\nof its business relationships, nor\nis it expected that the Fund\u0092s counterparties\nwill rely on the credit of BlackRock in\nevaluating the Fund\u0092s creditworthiness.\n\nBlackRock Institutional\nTrust Company, N.A. (\u0093BTC\u0094), an affiliate of\nBlackRock, pursuant to SEC exemptive relief,\nacts as securities lending agent to, and\nreceives a share of securities lending\nrevenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also\nreceive\ncompensation for managing the reinvestment of\nthe cash collateral from securities lending.\nThere are potential conflicts of interests in\nmanaging a securities lending program,\nincluding but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as\nsecurities\nlending agent may have an incentive to, among\nother things, increase or decrease the amount\nof securities on loan or to lend particular\nsecurities in order to generate additional\nrisk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its\naffiliates; and\n(ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may\nhave an incentive to allocate loans to clients\nthat would provide more revenue to BlackRock.\nAs described further below, BlackRock seeks to\nmitigate this conflict by providing its\nsecurities lending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation.\n\nAs part of its securities lending program,\nBlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain\nother clients and/or funds against a shortfall\nin collateral in the event of borrower\ndefault. On a regular basis, BlackRock\ncalculates the potential dollar exposure of\ncollateral shortfall\nresulting from a borrower default (\u0093shortfall\nrisk\u0094) in the securities lending program.\nBlackRock establishes program-wide borrower\nlimits (\u0093credit limits\u0094) to actively manage\nborrower-specific credit exposure.\nBlackRock oversees the risk model that\ncalculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary,\nBlackRock may adjust securities lending\nprogram attributes by restricting eligible\ncollateral or reducing borrower credit limits.\nAs a result, the management of program-wide\nexposure as well as BlackRock-specific\nindemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile).\n\nBlackRock may decline to make a securities\nloan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending\non behalf of a Fund or terminate a securities\nloan on behalf of a Fund for\nany reason, including but not limited to\nregulatory requirements and/or market rules,\nliquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain\ntypes of loans, loans in particular markets,\nloans of particular securities or types of\nsecurities, or for loans overall. In addition,\nsome borrowers may prefer certain BlackRock\nlenders that provide additional protections\nagainst lender\ndefault that are favored by their prudential\nregulation.\n\nBlackRock uses a predetermined systematic\nprocess in order to approximate pro rata\nallocation over\ntime. In order to allocate a loan to a\nportfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have\nsufficient lending capacity pursuant to the\nvarious program limits (i.e. indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending\nportfolio must hold the asset at the time a\nloan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the\nlending portfolio must also have enough\ninventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to\nsatisfy the loan request. In doing so,\nBlackRock seeks to provide equal lending\nopportunities for all portfolios, independent\nof whether BlackRock indemnifies the\nportfolio. Equal opportunities for lending\nportfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm.\n\nPurchases and sales of securities and other\nassets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated\nwith orders for other BlackRock client\naccounts, including with accounts\nthat pay different transaction costs solely\ndue to the fact that they have different\nresearch payment arrangements. BlackRock,\nhowever, is not required to bunch or aggregate\norders if portfolio management decisions for\ndifferent accounts\nare made separately, or if they determine that\nbunching or aggregating is not practicable or\nrequired, or in cases involving client\ndirection.\n\nPrevailing\ntrading activity frequently may make\nimpossible the receipt of the same price or\nexecution on the entire volume of securities\npurchased or sold. When this occurs, the\nvarious prices may be averaged,\n\n6\n\nand the Funds will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Funds. In addition,\nunder\ncertain circumstances, the Funds will not be\ncharged the same commission or commission\nequivalent rates in connection with a bunched\nor aggregated order.\n\nBlackRock does not currently enter into\narrangements to use the Fund\u0092s assets for, or\nparticipate in, soft dollars, although\nBlackRock may receive research that is\nbundled with the trade execution, clearing,\nand/or settlement services provided by a\nparticular broker-dealer. To the extent that\nBlackRock receives research on this basis,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist.\nFor example, the research effectively will be\npaid by client commissions that also will be\nused to pay for the execution, clearing, and\nsettlement services provided by the broker-\ndealer and will not be paid by BlackRock.\n\nSubject to applicable law, BlackRock may\nselect brokers that furnish BlackRock, the\nFunds, other BlackRock client accounts or\npersonnel, directly or through\ncorrespondent relationships, with research or\nother appropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock\u0092s view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price\nofferings and OTC transactions). Such research\nor other services may include, to the extent\npermitted by law, research reports on\ncompanies, industries and securities; economic\nand financial data; financial publications;\nproxy analysis;\ntrade industry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products.\n\nResearch or other services obtained in this\nmanner\nmay be used in servicing any or all of the\nFunds and other BlackRock client accounts,\nincluding in connection with BlackRock client\naccounts other than those that pay commissions\nto the broker relating to the research or\nother service\narrangements. Such products and services may\ndisproportionately benefit other BlackRock\nclient accounts relative to the Funds based on\nthe amount of brokerage commissions paid by\nthe Funds and such other BlackRock client\naccounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client\u0092s commissions may not be\nused in managing that client\u0092s account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate\nbenefits, of economies of scale or price\ndiscounts in connection with products and\nservices that may be provided to the Funds and\nto such other BlackRock client accounts. To\nthe extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars,\nit will not have to\npay for those products and services itself.\n\nBlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable\nlaw, may endeavor to execute trades through\nbrokers who,\npursuant to such arrangements, provide\nresearch or other services in order to ensure\nthe continued receipt of research or other\nservices BlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time\nto time choose not to engage in the above\ndescribed arrangements to varying degrees.\nBlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable\nlaw, may also enter into commission sharing\narrangements under which BlackRock may execute\ntransactions\nthrough a broker-dealer and request that the\nbroker-dealer allocate a portion of the\ncommissions or commission credits to another\nfirm that provides research to BlackRock. To\nthe extent that BlackRock engages in\ncommission sharing\narrangements, many of the same conflicts\nrelated to traditional soft dollars may exist.\n\nBlackRock may utilize certain electronic\ncrossing networks\n(\u0093ECNs\u0094) (including, without limitation, ECNs\nin which BlackRock has an investment or other\ninterest, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law) in executing client securities\ntransactions for certain types of securities.\nThese\nECNs may charge fees for their services,\nincluding access fees and transaction fees.\nThe transaction fees, which are similar to\ncommissions or markups/markdowns, will\ngenerally be charged to clients and, like\ncommissions and\nmarkups/markdowns, would generally be included\nin the cost of the securities purchased.\nAccess fees may be paid by BlackRock even\nthough incurred in connection with executing\ntransactions on behalf of clients, including\nthe Funds. In\ncertain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume\ndiscounts that will reduce the access fees\ntypically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nonly utilize ECNs consistent with its\nobligation to seek to obtain best execution in\nclient transactions.\n\n7\n\nBlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is\na member of, Members Exchange (\u0093MEMX\u0094), a\nnewly created\nU.S. stock exchange. Transactions for a Fund\nmay be executed on MEMX if third party brokers\nselect MEMX as the appropriate venue for\nexecution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of client portfolios. In\naddition, transactions\nin ETF shares may be executed on MEMX if third\nparty brokers select MEMX as the appropriate\nvenue for the execution of such orders.\n\nBlackRock has adopted policies\nand procedures designed to prevent conflicts\nof interest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Funds, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with\nBlackRock\u0092s fiduciary obligations to its\nclients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such\nproxy voting policies and procedures, actual\nproxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have\nthe effect of favoring the interests of other\nclients or\nbusinesses of other divisions or units of\nBlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes\nsuch voting decisions to be in accordance with\nits fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee\n\u0093Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures.\u0094\n\nIt is also possible that, from time to time,\nBlackRock and /or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and\nseparately managed accounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, purchase and\nhold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund\u0092s\nassets may enhance investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of\nscale that tend to reduce the Fund\u0092s expense\nratio.\n\nBlackRock reserves the right, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, to sell into\nthe market or redeem\nin Creation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of the Fund acquired for its own\naccounts or the account of a BlackRock\nadvisory client. A large sale or redemption of\nshares of the Fund by BlackRock itself\nor a BlackRock advisory client could\nsignificantly reduce the asset size of the\nFund, which might have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund\u0092s liquidity, investment flexibility,\nportfolio diversification, expense ratio or\nability to comply with the\nlisting requirements for the Fund.\n\nIt is possible that a Fund may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in transactions with,\ncompanies in which BlackRock has\nsignificant debt or equity investments or\nother interests. A Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured notes) by\nentities for which BlackRock provides and is\ncompensated for cash management services\nrelating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances. In making\ninvestment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is\nnot permitted to obtain or use material non-\npublic information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock, in the course\nof these activities. In addition, from time to\ntime, the activities of BlackRock may limit a\nFund\u0092s flexibility in purchases and sales of\nsecurities. As indicated below, BlackRock may\nengage in transactions with companies in\nwhich BlackRock-advised funds or other clients\nof BlackRock have an investment.\n\nBlackRock and its personnel and other\nfinancial service providers may have\ninterests in promoting sales of the Funds.\nWith respect to BlackRock and its personnel,\nthe remuneration and profitability relating to\nservices to and sales of the Funds or other\nproducts may be greater than remuneration and\nprofitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFunds or their\nshareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or\nother personnel may also benefit from\nincreased amounts of assets under management.\nFees and commissions may also be higher than\nfor other products or services, and the\nremuneration and\nprofitability to BlackRock and such personnel\nresulting from transactions on behalf of or\nmanagement of the Funds may be greater than\nthe remuneration and profitability resulting\nfrom other funds or products.\n\nThird parties, including service providers to\nBlackRock or the Fund, may sponsor events\n(including, but not limited to, marketing and\npromotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to the Fund.\n\nBlackRock may provide valuation assistance to\ncertain clients with respect to certain\nsecurities or other investments and the\nvaluation recommendations made for such\nclients\u0092 accounts may differ from the\nvaluations for the same securities or\ninvestments assigned by a Fund\u0092s\npricing vendors, especially if\n\n8\n\nsuch valuations are based on broker-dealer\nquotes or other data sources unavailable to\nthe Fund\u0092s pricing vendors. While BlackRock\nwill generally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to a Fund\u0092s\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund\u0092s pricing\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan\nthe valuation for such security or investment\ndetermined or recommended by BlackRock.\n\nAs disclosed in more detail in \u0093Determination\nof Net Asset Value\u0094 in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BlackRock\nto be unreliable, a Fund\u0092s investments are\nvalued at fair value by BlackRock. BlackRock\nhas been designated as the Fund\u0092s valuation\ndesignee\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment\nCompany Act and acts through BlackRock\u0092s Rule\n2a-5 Committee (the \u00932a-5\nCommittee\u0094), with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees and in accordance\nwith BlackRock\u0092s policies and procedures (the\n\u0093Valuation Procedures\u0094). When determining a\n\u0093fair value price,\u0094 the 2a-5 Committee seeks\nto determine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u0092s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the\nasset or liability to maturity. While fair\nvalue determinations will be based upon all\navailable factors that BlackRock deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BlackRock using\nproprietary or third party valuation models,\nfair value represents only a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. The fair value of one or more\nassets or liabilities may not, in retrospect,\nbe the price at which\nthose assets or liabilities could have been\nsold during the period in which the particular\nfair values were used in determining a Fund\u0092s\nNAV. As a result, a Fund\u0092s sale or redemption\nof its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding\nor holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee\nat fair value, may have the effect of diluting\nor increasing the economic interest of\nexisting shareholders and may affect the\namount of revenue received\nby BlackRock with respect to services for\nwhich it receives an asset-based fee.\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, a\nFund may invest all or some of its\nshort term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, a Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the Investment Company\nAct, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in a Fund bearing\nsome additional expenses.\n\nBlackRock and its directors, officers and\nemployees, may buy and sell securities or\nother investments for their own accounts and\nmay have conflicts of interest with\nrespect to investments made on behalf of a\nFund. As a result of differing trading and\ninvestment strategies or constraints,\npositions may be taken by directors, officers\nand employees of BlackRock that are the same,\ndifferent from or made\nat different times than positions taken for\nthe Fund. To lessen the possibility that a\nFund will be adversely affected by this\npersonal trading, the Fund, BRIL and BlackRock\neach have adopted a Code of Ethics in\ncompliance with\nSection 17(j) of the Investment Company Act\nthat restricts securities trading in the\npersonal accounts of investment professionals\nand others who normally come into possession\nof information regarding the Fund\u0092s portfolio\ntransactions. Each Code of Ethics is also\navailable on the EDGAR Database on the\nCommission\u0092s Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.\n\nBlackRock will not purchase securities or\nother property from, or sell securities or\nother\nproperty to, a Fund, except that the Fund may\nin accordance with rules or guidance adopted\nunder the Investment Company Act engage in\ntransactions with another Fund or accounts\nthat are affiliated with the Fund as a result\nof common\nofficers, directors, or investment advisers or\npursuant to exemptive orders granted to the\nFunds and/or BlackRock by the Commission.\nThese transactions would be effected in\ncircumstances in which BlackRock determined\nthat it would be\nappropriate for the Fund to purchase and\nanother client of BlackRock to sell, or the\nFund to sell and another client of BlackRock\nto purchase, the same security or instrument\non the same day. From time to time, the\nactivities of a Fund may\nbe restricted because of regulatory\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock and/or\nBlackRock\u0092s internal policies designed to\ncomply with, limit the applicability of, or\notherwise relate to such requirements. A\nclient not advised by\nBlackRock would not be subject to some of\nthose considerations. There may be periods\nwhen BlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities\nor instruments issued by or related to\ncompanies for which BlackRock is performing\n\n9\n\nadvisory or other services or has proprietary\npositions. For example, when BlackRock is\nengaged to provide advisory or risk management\nservices for a company, BlackRock may be\nprohibited\nfrom or limited in purchasing or selling\nsecurities of that company on behalf of a\nFund, particularly where such services result\nin BlackRock obtaining material non-public\ninformation about\nthe company (e.g., in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u0092 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which the Funds wish to purchase\nor sell.\nHowever, if permitted by applicable law, and\nwhere consistent with BlackRock\u0092s policies and\nprocedures (including the necessary\nimplementation of appropriate information\nbarriers), the Funds may purchase securities\nor instruments that\nare issued by such companies, are the subject\nof an advisory or risk management assignment\nby BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock\nare directors or officers of the issuer.\n\nBlackRock has adopted and implemented policies\nand procedures that are designed to address\npotential conflicts that arise in connection\nwith the advisory services\nBlackRock provides to Funds and other clients.\nCertain BlackRock advisory personnel may take\nviews, and make decisions or recommendations,\nthat are different than or opposite those of\nother BlackRock advisory personnel. Certain\nportfolio management\nteams within BlackRock may make decisions or\ntake (or refrain from taking) actions with\nrespect to clients they advise in a manner\ndifferent than or adverse to the decisions\nmade or the actions taken (or not taken) by\nthe Funds\u0092 portfolio\nmanagement teams. The various portfolio\nmanagement teams may not share information\nwith each other, including as a result of\ncertain information barriers and other\npolicies, and will not have any obligation or\nother duty to do so.\n\nBlackRock has established certain information\nbarriers and other policies to address the\nsharing of information between different\nbusinesses within BlackRock, including,\neffective on or about January 21, 2025, with\nrespect to personnel responsible with managing\nportfolios and voting proxies with respect to\ncertain index equity portfolios versus those\nresponsible for managing portfolios and voting\nproxies with\nrespect to all other portfolios. As a result\nof information barriers, certain units of\nBlackRock generally will not have access, or\nwill have limited access, to certain\ninformation and personnel, including senior\npersonnel, in other units of\nBlackRock, and generally will not manage the\nFunds with the benefit of information\npossessed by such other units. Therefore,\nBlackRock may not be able to review potential\ninvestments for the Funds with the benefit of\ninformation held by certain\nareas of BlackRock.\n\nBlackRock may determine to move certain\npersonnel, businesses, or business units from\none side of an information barrier to the\nother side of\nthe information barrier. In connection\ntherewith, BlackRock personnel, businesses,\nand business units that were moved will no\nlonger have access to the information and\npersonnel from the side of the information\nbarrier from which they were moved.\nInformation obtained in connection with such\nchanges to information barriers may limit or\nrestrict the ability of BlackRock to engage in\nor otherwise effect transactions on behalf of\nthe Funds (including purchasing or selling\nsecurities that\nBlackRock may otherwise have purchased or sold\nfor a client in the absence of a change to an\ninformation barrier). Information barriers may\nnot have their intended impact due to, for\nexample, changes in applicable law or\ninadvertent crossings of the\nbarriers, and actions by personnel on one side\nof a barrier may impact the potential actions\nof personnel on the other side of a barrier.\n\nAlthough the information\nbarriers are intended to allow for independent\nportfolio management decision-making and proxy\nvoting among certain BlackRock businesses, the\ninvestment activities of BlackRock for\nBlackRock clients, as well as BlackRock\u0092s\nproprietary accounts,\nmay nonetheless limit the investment\nstrategies and rights of other clients\n(including the Fund). As BlackRock\u0092s assets\nunder management increases, BlackRock clients\nmay face greater negative impacts due to\nownership restrictions and\nlimitations imposed by laws, regulations,\nrules, regulators, or issuers. For example, in\ncertain circumstances where a BlackRock client\ninvests in securities issued by companies that\noperate in certain industries (e.g., banking,\ninsurance, and\nutilities) or in certain emerging or\ninternational markets, or are subject to\nregulatory or corporate ownership restrictions\n(e.g., with mechanisms such as poison pills in\nplace to prevent takeovers), or where a\nBlackRock client invests in\ncertain futures and derivatives, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for its clients and BlackRock\u0092s\nproprietary accounts that may not be exceeded\nwithout the grant of a license or other\nregulatory\nor corporate approval, order, consent, relief,\nwaiver or non-disapproval or, if exceeded, may\ncause BlackRock or its\n\n10\n\nclients to be subject to enforcement actions,\ndisgorgement of share ownership or profits,\nregulatory restrictions, complex compliance\nreporting, increased compliance costs or\nsuffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. In\nlight of certain restrictions, BlackRock may\nalso seek to make indirect investments (e.g.,\nusing derivatives) on behalf of its clients to\nreceive exposure to certain securities in\nexcess of the\napplicable ownership restrictions and\nlimitations when legally permitted that will\nexpose such clients to additional costs and\nadditional risks, including any risks\nassociated with investing in derivatives.\nThere may be limited availability of\nderivatives that provide indirect exposure to\nan impacted security. In addition, BlackRock\nclients can be subject to more than one\nownership limitation depending on each\nclient\u0092s holdings, and each ownership\nlimitation can impact multiple\nsecurities held by the client. Certain clients\nor shareholders may have their own overlapping\nobligations to monitor their compliance with\nownership limitations across their\ninvestments.\n\nIf certain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or a BlackRock client or as a result\nof corporate actions by the issuer,\nthe ability of BlackRock on behalf of clients\nto purchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights (including voting) or\nundertake business transactions, may be\nrestricted by law, regulation, rule, or\norganizational documents or otherwise\nimpaired. For example, to meet the\nrequirements of an ownership limitation or\nrestriction, a client may be unable to\npurchase or directly hold a security the\nclient would otherwise purchase or hold. The\nlimitation or restriction may be based on the\nholdings of other BlackRock clients instead of\nthe specific client being restricted. For\nindex funds, this means a fund may not be able\nto track its index as closely as it would if\nit was not subject to an ownership limitation\nor restriction because\nthe fund cannot acquire the amount of the\nimpacted security included in its index.\nBlackRock on behalf of its clients may limit\npurchases, sell existing investments, utilize\nindirect investments, utilize information\nbarriers, or\notherwise restrict, forgo, or limit the\nexercise of rights (including transferring,\noutsourcing, or limiting voting rights or\nforgoing the right to receive dividends) when\nBlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it\nappropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. These types of\nrestrictions could negatively impact a\nclient\u0092s performance or ability to meet its\ninvestment\nobjective.\n\nWhen BlackRock or a BlackRock client is\nsubject to an ownership limitation, BlackRock\nmay in its discretion seek permission from the\napplicable issuers\nor regulators to exceed the limitation.\nHowever, there is no guarantee that permission\nwill be granted, or that, once granted, it\nwill not be modified or revoked at a later\ndate with minimal or no notice. The issuer\nand/or regulator may also require\nthat BlackRock on behalf of itself and its\nclients take or refrain from taking certain\nactions in connection with the approval,\norder, consent, relief or non-disapproval,\nwhich BlackRock may accept if it\nbelieves the benefits outweigh the costs and\nmay limit BlackRock from taking actions that\nit otherwise would take. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment\nopportunities equitably among clients, taking\ninto consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock may adopt\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits,\nincluding, for example, when ownership in\ncertain securities nears an applicable\nthreshold, BlackRock may limit additional\npurchases in such securities or, with respect\nto ETFs, remove such securities from the list\nof Deposit Securities to be\ndelivered to the Fund in connection with\npurchases of Creation Units of such Fund. If\nclient holdings of an issuer exceed an\napplicable threshold and BlackRock is unable\nto obtain relief to enable the continued\nholding of such investments, it\nmay be necessary to reduce these positions to\nmeet the applicable limitations and BlackRock\nor such client may be subject to regulatory\nactions. In these cases, the investments will\nbe sold in a manner that BlackRock deems fair\nand equitable\nover time.\n\nOwnership limitations are highly complex. It\nis possible that, despite BlackRock\u0092s intent\nto either comply with or be granted permission\nto exceed\nownership limitations, it may inadvertently\nbreach a limit or violate the corporate or\nregulatory approval, order, consent, relief or\nnon-disapproval that was obtained.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, other ownership\nthresholds may trigger reporting requirements\nto governmental and regulatory authorities,\nand such reports may entail\nthe disclosure of the identity of a client or\nBlackRock\u0092s intended strategy with respect to\nsuch security or asset.\n\nBlackRock may not serve as an\nAuthorized Participant in the creation and\nredemption of iShares ETFs.\n\n11\n\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has,\nwhen applicable, retained BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (the\n\u0093Distributor\u0094 or \u0093BRIL\u0094), an Affiliate of BFA,\nto perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units of\nthe Fund\n(\u0093ETF Services\u0094). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated\nwith, and received payment from, Citibank,\nN.A. (\u0093Citibank\u0094) on the design and\ndevelopment of the ETF Services platform.\nCitibank may have, or from time to time may\ndevelop, additional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA\nand its affiliates.\n\nIn order to defray transaction expenses and\nprotect against possible shareholder dilution,\nthe Fund may collect certain fees from\nAuthorized\nParticipants in connection with cash\nsubstitutions for creation and redemption\ntransactions. While BlackRock uses good faith\nestimates of the expected costs to the Fund in\ndetermining the rates for fees collected by\nthe Fund related to creation and\nredemption activity, BlackRock may have\nincentives to improve Fund performance through\nthe collection of these fees. As these charges\nare based on estimates, where the charges\nexceed actual transaction- related costs\nand/or expenses incurred by the\nFund, Fund performance could improve as a\nresult. BlackRock has established processes to\noversee the determination of these estimates\nin an effort to mitigate this conflict.\n\nBlackRock may maintain securities indices. To\nthe extent permitted by applicable laws, the\nFunds may seek to license and use such indices\nas part of their\ninvestment strategy. Index based funds that\nseek to track the performance of securities\nindices also may use the name of the index or\nindex provider in the fund name. Index\nproviders, including BlackRock (to the extent\npermitted by\napplicable law), may be paid licensing fees\nfor use of their index or index name. In\ninstances where BlackRock charges a unitary\nmanagement fee, BlackRock may have a financial\nincentive to use a BlackRock index that is\nless costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Funds using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to a Fund\nand the\nFunds are under no obligation to use BlackRock\nindices. Any Fund that enters into a license\nfor a BlackRock index cannot be assured that\nthe terms of any index licensing agreement\nwith BlackRock will be as favorable as those\nterms offered\nto other licensees.\n\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to a Fund (e.g., custodians,\nadministrators and index\nproviders) pursuant to which BlackRock\nreceives fee discounts or concessions in\nrecognition of BlackRock\u0092s overall\nrelationship with such service providers.\nBlackRock may also enter into contractual\narrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u0092s\nservices are terminated with respect to a\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it\nreceives from the Funds, the benefits of lower\nfees, including any fee discounts or\nconcessions, or any additional savings, may\naccrue, in whole or in part, to BlackRock,\nwhich could result in conflicts of interest\nrelating to the use or\ntermination of service providers to a Fund. In\naddition, conflicts of interest may arise with\nrespect to contractual arrangements with\nthird-party service providers to a Fund, or\nthe selection of such providers, particularly\nin circumstances\nwhere BlackRock is negotiating on behalf of\nboth funds that have a unitary management fee\nand those that do not or different service\nproviders have different fee structures.\n\nConflicts of interest may arise as a result of\nsimultaneous investment management of multiple\nclient accounts by the BlackRock\u0092s investment\nprofessionals. For\nexample, differences in the advisory fee\nstructure may create the appearance of actual\nor potential conflicts of interest because\nsuch differences could create pecuniary\nincentives for BlackRock to favor one client\naccount over another.\n\nBlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in\ncertain trading, portfolio management,\noperations and/or information systems used by\nFund service providers.\nThese systems are, or will be, used by a Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Funds, that engage\nthe service\nprovider (typically the custodian). A Fund\u0092s\nservice provider remunerates BlackRock for the\nuse of the systems. A Fund service provider\u0092s\npayments to BlackRock for the use of these\nsystems may enhance the profitability of\nBlackRock.\n\n12\n\nBlackRock\u0092s receipt of fees from a service\nprovider in connection with the use of systems\nprovided by\nBlackRock may create an incentive for\nBlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into\nor renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider.\n\nIn recognition of a\nBlackRock client\u0092s overall relationship with\nBlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not affect Fund fees and\nexpenses\napplicable to such client\u0092s investment in a\nFund.\n\nPresent and future activities of BlackRock and\nits directors, officers and employees, in\naddition to\nthose described in this section, may give rise\nto additional conflicts of interest.\n\nIf you have any questions, please call\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\n\niShares is a registered trademark of\nBlackRock Fund Advisors and its affiliates.\n\nIS-A-SUPP-IVV-VOTE-1224\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT\n\nFOR FUTURE REFERENCE\n\nAppendix B\n\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF - Proxy Voting Policy\n                                        \n  iShares Core S&P 500 ETF              \n  \u0096 Proxy Voting Policy \u00a0 \u2009Procedures    \n  Governing Delegation of Proxy Voting  \n                                        \nEffective Date: January 1, 2025\n\nApplies to the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF\n\nObjective and Scope\n\nSet forth below is the Proxy Voting Policy\n(the\n\u0093Policy\u0094) for the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF\n(the \u0093Fund\u0094), a series of iShares Trust (the\n\u0093Trust\u0094).\n\nPolicy / Document Requirements and Statements\n\nThe Board of Trustees (\u0093Board\u0094) of the Trust\nhas the responsibility for the oversight of\nvoting proxies relating to\nportfolio securities of the Fund.

In\nthe event that an Eligible Shareholder has not\nmade a survey election or a shareholder is not\nan Eligible Shareholder, the shareholder\u0092s pro\nrata shares\nwill be voted pursuant to the BlackRock Proxy\nVoting Guidelines.\n\nExcept as described below, BlackRock will cast\nvotes on behalf of the Fund on specific proxy\nissues in respect of securities held by the\nFund (or may refrain from voting) in\naccordance with the Proxy Voting Policies. The\nnumber of shares voted pursuant to each Proxy\nVoting Policy will be based on the\npro-rata ownership of shareholders that have\nselected such Proxy Voting Policy, calculated\nas of the record date for the applicable proxy\nfor the underlying security held by the Fund.\nBlackRock will rely on\nthe information reasonably available to it to\ndetermine the percentages and corresponding\nvotes for the shareholder accounts.\n\nBlackRock is authorized to use\ndiscretion in limiting the use of a Third-\nParty Proxy Voting Policy for certain\nunderlying securities or certain proposals due\nto considerations including, but not limited\nto, cost, operational risk and/or complexity,\nlocal market regulation and\npractice, and financial considerations,\nincluding the decision not to recall\nsecurities on loan by the Fund. In addition,\nfor corporate actions, special meetings such\nas in connection with merger transactions or\nother sale of control transactions,\nvoting in contested director elections, or\nother proxy issues where BlackRock has\ndetermined that a consistent vote cast\naccording to the BlackRock Proxy Voting\nGuidelines would be in the best interest of\nthe Fund as a whole, BlackRock will apply\nthe BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines.\n\nIn the event that a third-party service\nprovider materially modifies a Third-Party\nProxy Voting Policy, BlackRock will use\nthe updated Third-Party Proxy Voting Policy\nunless BlackRock believes the changes are\nmaterially inconsistent with the overall\nobjectives of the Program or would have\nchanged BlackRock\u0092s recommendation to the\nBoard to include the Third-Party\nProxy Voting Policy in the Program. If\nBlackRock determines the changes are\nmaterially inconsistent with the overall\nobjectives of the Program or would have\nchanged BlackRock\u0092s recommendation to the\nBoard to include the Third-Party Proxy Voting\nPolicy in the Program, BlackRock will apply\nthe BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines and\nprovide an update to the Board at the next\nregular meeting.\n\nBlackRock will\nreview proxy voting activity on behalf of the\nFund, including any voting conducted in\naccordance with a Third-Party Proxy Voting\nPolicy, to ensure that votes are cast in\naccordance with this Policy and the applicable\nProxy Voting Policy.\n\nConflicts Management\n\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to\nprevent undue influence on BlackRock\u0092s proxy\nvoting activity and to mitigate material\nconflicts of interest in the exercise of proxy\nvoting responsibilities. Potential material\nconflicts, and the resultant potential for\nundue influence, might\nbe due to a relationship between the investee\ncompany (or any shareholder proponent or\ndissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u0092s affiliates or employees, or a Fund\nor a Fund\u0092s affiliates. BlackRock has taken\ncertain steps to\nmitigate potential conflicts, which are\noutlined in detail in the BlackRock Proxy\nVoting Guidelines. In mitigating conflicts,\nBIS will adhere to the BlackRock Proxy Voting\nGuidelines.\n                         \n  Public    Page 2 of 3  \n                         \niShares Core S&P 500 ETF - Proxy Voting Policy\n\nIn certain instances, BIS will engage an\nindependent third-party voting service\nprovider to make\n\nproxy voting recommendations as a further\nsafeguard to avoid potential conflicts of\ninterest, to satisfy regulatory compliance\nrequirements, or as may be otherwise\nrequired by applicable law.\n\nWith respect to the relationship between\nsecurities lending and proxy voting, shares on\nloan cannot be voted and BlackRock may\ndetermine to recall them for voting, as guided\nby BlackRock\u0092s fiduciary responsibility to act\nin clients\u0092 financial interests. The BlackRock\nProxy Voting Guidelines set forth BlackRock\u0092s\napproach to recalling securities on loan in\nconnection with proxy voting, which applies to\nthe decision to recall securities even when\nBlackRock would otherwise use a Third-Party\nProxy Voting Policy.\n\nReports to the Board\n\nBlackRock will report on an annual basis to\nthe Board\non (1) investor participation in the Program;\n(2) feedback from investors and the public;\n(3) BlackRock\u0092s analysis of voting outcomes\nunder the various Proxy Voting Policies and a\nrepresentation that all votes were made in\naccordance with this Policy; (4) any changes\nto the Proxy Voting Policies that have not\npreviously been reported; (5) updates on the\nscope of Voting Choice at BlackRock and\nsimilar programs offered within the registered\ninvestment company\nindustry; (6) any operational issues under the\nPolicy; and (7) any material changes to\nconflicts management practices that have not\npreviously been reported.\n                         \n  Public    Page 3 of 3  \n                         \nBlackRock Investment Stewardship\n\nGlobal Principles for Benchmark Policies\n\nEffective as of January 2025\n\nContents\n                                              \n  Introduction to BlackRock Investment     3  \n  Stewardship                                 \n  Philosophy on investment stewardship     3  \n  Shareholder rights                       3  \n  Stewardship in practice                  4  \n  Key themes                               4  \n  Boards and directors                     5  \n  Auditors and audit-related issues        7  \n  Capital structure, mergers, asset           \n  sales, and other special                 8  \n  transactions                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Executive compensation                   9  \n  Material sustainability-related             \n  risks and                               10  \n  opportunities                               \n  Other corporate governance matters          \n  and shareholder                         13  \n  protections                                 \n  Shareholder proposals                   13  \n  BlackRock\u0092s oversight of its                 \n  investment stewardship                  14  \n  activities                                  \n  Voting guidelines and vote execution    15  \n  Voting Choice                           16  \n  Conflicts management policies and       16  \n  procedures                                  \n  Securities lending                      17  \n  Reporting and vote transparency         18  \n                                              \nThe purpose of this document is to provide an\noverarching explanation of BlackRock\u0092s global\napproach to our responsibilities as a\nshareholder on behalf of our clients, the\nprinciples that guide our dialogue with\ncompanies, and our commitments to clients in\nterms of our own governance and transparency.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0            Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment\u00a0           2                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nIntroduction to BlackRock Investment\nStewardship\n\nBlackRock\u0092s clients depend on us to help them\nmeet their varied investment goals. We\nconsider it one of our responsibilities to be\nan informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf, given the business decisions\nthat companies make have a direct impact on\nour clients\u0092 long-term investment outcomes and\nfinancial well-being. BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) is a dedicated function\nwithin BlackRock,\nwhich is responsible for engaging with public\ncompanies on behalf of index strategies.\nInvestment Stewardship is one of the ways we\nfulfill our fiduciary responsibilities as an\nasset manager to our clients. Our sole\nobjective when conducting our\nstewardship program is to advance our clients\u0092\nlong-term financial interests.\n\nBIS takes a long-term\napproach in our stewardship efforts,\nreflecting the investment horizons of the\nmajority of our clients. BIS does this\nthrough:\n\n1. Engaging with\ncompanies in a two-way dialogue to build our\nunderstanding of a company\u0092s practices and\ninform our voting decisions.\n\n2. Voting at shareholder meetings on\nmanagement and shareholder proposals on behalf\nof clients who have delegated voting authority\nto BlackRock.\n\n3. Contributing to industry dialogue on\nstewardship to share our perspectives on\nmatters that may impact our clients\u0092\ninvestments.\n\n4. Reporting on our activities to inform\nclients about our stewardship efforts on their\nbehalf through a range of publications and\ndirect reporting.\n\nPhilosophy on investment stewardship\n\nSound\ngovernance is critical to the success of a\ncompany, the protection of investors\u0092\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. Research indicates that high-\nperforming companies will effectively evaluate\nand address risks and opportunities\nrelevant to their businesses, which supports\ndurable, long-term financial value creation.\n\nSetting, executing,\nand overseeing strategy are the responsibility\nof management and the board. As one of many\nminority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u0096 and\ndoes not try to \u0096 direct a company\u0092s strategy\nor its implementation. Our role, on behalf of\nBlackRock\u0092s clients as long-term investors, is\nto better understand how corporate leadership\nis managing material risks and capitalizing on\nopportunities to help protect and enhance the\ncompany\u0092s ability to deliver long-term\nfinancial\nreturns. We aim to take a globally consistent\napproach, while recognizing the unique markets\nand sectors in which companies operate.\n\nShareholder rights\n\nCorporate law, regulations and listing rules\nin most markets establish certain fundamental\nrights attached to shareholding. Shareholders\nshould have the right to:\n                                              \n       Elect, remove, and nominate            \n  \u00b7    directors, approve the appointment of  \n       the auditor, and amend the corporate   \n       charter or by-laws.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote on key board decisions that are   \n       material to the protection of their    \n       investment, including but not limited  \n  \u00b7    to, changes                            \n       to the purpose of the business,        \n       dilution levels and pre-emptive        \n       rights, and the distribution of        \n       income and capital structure.          \n                                              \nBIS\u0092 Benchmark Policies, and the vote\ndecisions made consistent with these policies,\ntake a financial materiality-based approach\nand are focused solely on advancing clients\u0092\nfinancial interests. BIS\u0092 Benchmark Policies\u0096\ncomprised\nof the BIS , and \u0096 apply to clients\u0092 assets\ninvested through index strategies and provide\nguidance on our position on common corporate\ngovernance matters. We\ntake a globally consistent approach, while\nrecognizing the unique markets and sectors in\nwhich companies operate. BlackRock offers a\nwide range of investment products and funds to\nsupport our clients\u0092 unique and varied\ninvestment objectives.\nOther materials on the BIS might also provide\nuseful context.\n\nPwC, \u0093The 3 things all\nhigh-performing companies do\u0094. Harvard\nBusiness Review, \u0093\u0094, March 2024.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0            Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment\u00a0           3                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Access sufficient and timely           \n       information on material governance,    \n  \u00b7    strategic, and business matters to     \n       make informed                          \n       decisions.                             \n                                              \nTo protect the interest of minority\nshareholders like BlackRock\u0092s clients, BIS\nholds the view that shareholder voting rights\nshould be proportionate to economic\nownership\u0097the principle of \u0093one share, one\nvote\u0094 helps to achieve this balance.\n\nStewardship in practice\n\nThe assets\nBlackRock manages belong to our clients, which\ninclude public and private pension plans,\ninsurers, official institutions, endowments,\nuniversities, charities, family offices,\nwealth managers, and ultimately, the\nindividual investors that they serve.\nThrough stewardship, we assess how companies\nare creating long-term financial value to\nserve our clients, many of whom are saving for\nlong-term goals, such as retirement.\n\nAs shareholders of public companies, our\nclients have the right to vote on matters\nproposed by a company\u0092s management or its\nshareholders. Voting is an important\nmechanism for investors to express support\nfor, or concern about, a company\u0092s performance\nand most of our clients authorize BlackRock to\nexercise this right on their behalf. For those\nclients, and as a fiduciary, BlackRock is\nlegally required\nto make proxy voting determinations in a\nmanner that is consistent with their\ninvestment objectives. BIS does this by\ncasting votes in favor of proposals that, in\nour assessment, will promote stronger\ngovernance and better operating practices and,\nin turn, potentially enhance long-term\nshareholder value. Our vote decisions are\ninformed by our in-depth analysis of company\ndisclosures, engagement with boards and\nmanagement teams, third-party research, and\ncomparisons against a company\u0092s industry\npeers.\n\nBIS takes a constructive, long-term approach\nto our engagement with companies, reflecting\nthe investment\nhorizons of the majority of our clients. An\nengagement is a meeting between BIS and a\ncompany\u0092s board and management that helps\nimprove our understanding of the company\u0092s\nbusiness model and material risks and\nopportunities, to inform our\nvoting decisions on behalf of clients who\nauthorize us to vote on their behalf. In these\ntwo-way conversations, we listen to and learn\ndirectly from company directors and executives\nand ask questions relevant\nto their business. Either a company or BIS can\nrequest an engagement. Many of the engagements\nare initiated by companies to discuss their\nlong-term strategy, risk and opportunity set,\nand management\u0092s plan to deliver financial\nreturns through\nbusiness cycles. The ongoing, multiyear nature\nof our engagements allows us to build strong\nrelationships with company leadership and\nmutual understanding on key matters of\ncorporate governance and the drivers of long-\nterm financial performance.\n\nGenerally, we support the vote recommendations\nof the board of directors and management. In\ncase of concerns, we typically raise these\nthrough dialogue with board\nmembers and management teams first. When we\ndetermine it is in our clients\u0092 financial\ninterests to convey concern to companies\nthrough voting, we do so in two forms: we\nmight not support the election of directors or\nother management proposals,\nor we might not support management\u0092s voting\nrecommendation on a shareholder proposal.\n\nKey themes\n\nWhile accepted standards and norms of\ncorporate governance can differ between\nmarkets, in our experience, there are certain\nglobally applicable fundamental elements of\ncorporate governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u0092s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u0093Principles\u0094), which are\nanchored in\ntransparency and accountability.\n\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted corporate\ngovernance standards in their domestic market,\nand we ask that, if they do not, they explain\nhow their approach better supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation.\n\nOur regional voting guidelines, which we\npublish on the BIS , reflect these different\nmarket standards and norms. Depending on the\nmarket, generally accepted practice is\ninformed by corporate law, market regulation,\nbest practices, and\nindustry initiatives, amongst other factors.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0            Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment\u00a0           4                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nThese Principles cover seven key subjects:\n                            \n      Boards and directors  \n                            \n                                         \n      Auditors and audit-related issues  \n                                         \n                                              \n      Capital structure, mergers, asset       \n      sales, and other special transactions   \n                                              \n                              \n      Executive compensation  \n                              \n                                              \n      Material sustainability-related risks   \n      and opportunities                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Other corporate governance matters and  \n      shareholder protections                 \n                                              \n                             \n      Shareholder proposals  \n                             \nOur regional and market-specific explain how\nthese Principles inform our voting decisions\nin relation to common ballot items for\nshareholder\nmeetings in those markets. Alongside the\nPrinciples and regional voting guidelines, BIS\npublishes our which reflect the on which we\nmost frequently engage companies, where they\nare relevant, as these\ncan be a source of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship program globally and within each\nmarket. The BIS policies are not\nprescriptive, applied on a pragmatic, case-by-\ncase basis, taking into consideration a number\nof factors, including the sector, market, and\nbusiness environment within\nwhich a company is operating.\n\nBoards and directors\n\nCompanies whose boards are comprised of\nappropriately qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u0092s business enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. A\nstrong board gives a company a competitive\nadvantage, providing valuable oversight and\ncontributing to the most important management\ndecisions that support\nlong-term financial performance. As part of\ntheir responsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. This is why our\ninvestment stewardship efforts\nhave always started with the performance of\nthe board of directors, and why we see\nengagement with, and the election of,\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. We engage, as necessary,\nwith members of the board\u0092s nominating\nand/or governance committee to assess whether\ngovernance practices and board composition are\nappropriate given a company\u0092s business model\nand we take into consideration a number of\nfactors, including the sector, market, and\nbusiness environment\nwithin which a company is operating.\n\nWe view it as good practice when the board\nestablishes and maintains a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms\nto support its oversight of the company\u0092s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors\nengage with and oversee management. Disclosure\nof material risks that may affect a company\u0092s\nlong-term strategy and financial value\ncreation, including material sustainability-\nrelated factors when relevant, is helpful for\ninvestors to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks.\n\nWe seek to understand management\u0092s\nlong-term strategy and the milestones against\nwhich investors should assess its\nimplementation. If any strategic targets are\nsignificantly missed or materially restated,\nwe find it helpful when company disclosures\nprovide a detailed explanation of\nthe changes and an indication of the board\u0092s\nrole in reviewing the revised targets. We look\nto the board to articulate the effectiveness\nof these mechanisms in overseeing the\nmanagement of business risks and opportunities\nand the fulfillment of\nthe company\u0092s strategy.\n\nWhere a company has not adequately disclosed\nand demonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk\noversight responsibilities, we may consider\nvoting against the election of directors who,\non our assessment, have particular\nresponsibility for the issues. We assess\ndirector\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0            Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment\u00a0           5                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nperformance on a case-by-case basis and in\nlight of each company\u0092s circumstances, taking\ninto consideration\nits governance, business practices that\nsupport durable, long-term financial value\ncreation, and performance. Set out below are\nfactors we may take into consideration.\n\nRegular accountability through director\nelections\n\nTo ensure accountability\nfor their actions on behalf of shareholders,\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. Annual\ndirector elections allow shareholders to\nreaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all\ndirectors have had their appointment re-\nconfirmed, with a proportion of directors\nbeing put forward for election at each annual\ngeneral meeting.\n\nEffective board composition\n\nRegular director elections also give boards\nthe\nopportunity to adjust their composition in an\norderly way to reflect developments in the\ncompany\u0092s strategy and the market environment.\nIn our view, it is beneficial for new\ndirectors to be brought onto the board\nperiodically to refresh the\ngroup\u0092s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board and seek a balance between\nthe knowledge and experience of longer-serving\ndirectors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently.\n\nWe encourage companies to regularly review the\neffectiveness of their board (including its\nsize), and assess\ndirectors nominated for election in the\ncontext of the composition of the board as a\nwhole. In our view, the company\u0092s assessment\nshould consider a number of factors, including\neach director\u0092s independence and time\ncommitments, as well as\nthe breadth and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\ncollectively contribute to the board\u0092s\neffectiveness in advising and overseeing\nmanagement in delivering long-term financial\nreturns.\n\nDirector independence \u0097 from management,\nsignificant shareholders, or other related\nparties \u0096 is a central tenet of sound\ncorporate governance across markets. We\nencourage boards to have a sufficient number\nof independent directors, free from conflicts\nof interest or undue influence, to ensure\nobjectivity in the decision-making of the\nboard and its ability\nto oversee management. We generally consider\nit good practice for independent directors to\nmake a majority of the board, or in the case\nof controlled companies, at least one-third.\n\nCommon impediments to independence may include\nbut are not limited to:\n                                              \n      Current or recent employment at the     \n      company or a subsidiary                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Being, or representing, a shareholder   \n      with a substantial shareholding in the  \n      company                                 \n                                              \n                                  \n      Interlocking directorships  \n                                  \n                                              \n      Having any other interest, business,    \n      or other relationship which could, or   \n      could reasonably be perceived to,       \n      materially                              \n      interfere with a director\u0092s ability to   \n      act in the best interests of the        \n      company and shareholders                \n                                              \nIn our experience, boards are most effective\nat overseeing and advising management when\nthere is a senior, independent board leader.\nThis director may chair the board, or, where\nthe chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role\nof this director is to enhance the\neffectiveness of the independent members of\nthe board through shaping the agenda, ensuring\nadequate information is provided to the board,\nand encouraging independent director\nparticipation in board deliberations.\nThe lead independent director or another\nappropriate director should be available to\nmeet with shareholders in those situations\nwhere an independent director is best placed\nto explain and contextualize a company\u0092s\napproach.\n\nIn most markets directors stand for re-\nelection on an annual or triennial basis, as\ndetermined by corporate law, market regulation\nor voluntary best practice.\n\nPlease see: Tokyo Stock Exchange. \u0093.\u0094 June 11,\n2021;\nFinancial Reporting Council. \u0093.\u0094 July 16,\n2018; Investor Stewardship Group. \u0093.\u0094\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0            Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment\u00a0           6                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nThere are matters for which the board has\nresponsibility that may involve a conflict of\ninterest for executives or for\naffiliated directors or require additional\nfocus. It is our view that objective oversight\nof such matters is best achieved when the\nboard forms committees with a majority of\nindependent directors, depending on market\nnorms and a company\u0092s\nownership structure. In many markets, these\ncommittees of the board specialize in audit,\ndirector nominations, and compensation\nmatters. An ad hoc committee might also be\nformed to decide on a special transaction,\nparticularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event.\n\nWhen nominating directors to the board, we\nlook to companies to provide sufficient\ninformation on the\nindividual candidates so that shareholders can\nassess the capabilities and suitability of\neach individual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective\nexperience and expertise of the board, as well\nas the particular skill sets of individual\ndirectors, aligns with the company\u0092s long-term\nstrategy and business model. Highly qualified,\nengaged directors with professional\ncharacteristics\nrelevant to a company\u0092s business and strategy\nenhance the ability of the board to add value\nand be the voice of shareholders in board\ndiscussions.\n\nIt is in\nthis context that we are interested in a\nvariety of experiences, perspectives, and\nskillsets in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans of promoting diversity of thought to\navoid \u0093group think\u0094 in the board\u0092s exercise of\nits\nresponsibilities to advise and oversee\nmanagement.\n\nIn assessing board composition, we take a\ncase-by-case approach based on a company\u0092s\nboard size, business model, strategy, location\nand market capitalization. We look for\ncompanies to explain how their\napproach to board composition supports the\ncompany\u0092s governance practices.\n\nWe note that in many markets, policymakers\nhave set board gender diversity goals\nwhich we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a risk their board\ncomposition may be misaligned. We ask boards\nto disclose, consistent with local laws, how\ndiversity, including professional and personal\ncharacteristics, is considered\nin board composition, given the company\u0092s\nlong-term strategy and business model.\n\nSufficient capacity\n\nAs the role and expectations of a director are\nincreasingly demanding, directors must be able\nto commit an appropriate amount of time to\nboard and committee\nmatters. It is important that directors have\nthe capacity to meet all of their\nresponsibilities \u0096 including when there are\nunforeseen events \u0096 and therefore, they should\nnot take on an excessive number of roles that\nwould impair their\nability to fulfill their duties.\n\nAuditors and audit-related issues\n\nBlackRock recognizes the critical importance\nof financial statements, which should provide\na true and fair picture of a company\u0092s\nfinancial condition. Accordingly,\nwe look for the assumptions made by management\nand reviewed by the auditor in preparing the\nfinancial statements to be reasonable and\njustified.\n\nThe accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly\nrecognize that a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the\nassumptions underlying financial statements,\nparticularly those that pertain to the impact\nof the transition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u0092s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is\nan area of evolving practice and note that\ninternational standards setters, such as the\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards\n(IFRS) Board and the International Auditing\nand Assurance Standards Board (IAASB),\ncontinue to develop their guidance\nto companies.\n\nPersonal characteristics may include, but are\nnot limited to, gender; race/ethnicity;\ndisability; veteran status; LGBTQ+; and\nnational, Indigenous, religious, or cultural\nidentity.\n\nIFRS, \u0093\u0094, June 2023, and IAASB, \u0093\u0094, August\n2023.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0            Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment\u00a0           7                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nIn this context, audit committees, or\nequivalent, play a vital role in a company\u0092s\nfinancial reporting system by\nproviding independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a\ndedicated risk committee, these committees can\nprovide oversight of Enterprise Risk\nManagement systems. In our view, effective\naudit committee oversight strengthens the\nquality and reliability of\na company\u0092s financial statements and provides\nan important level of reassurance to\nshareholders.\n\nAudit committees or equivalent should have\nclearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on\nmanagement, internal audit, and the\nindependent auditor in fulfilling their\nresponsibilities but look to committee members\nto demonstrate they have relevant expertise to\nmonitor and oversee the audit process and\nrelated activities.\n\nWe take particular note of unexplained changes\nin reporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material\nfinancial weakness. In this respect, audit\ncommittees should provide timely disclosure on\nthe remediation of Key and Critical Audit\nMatters identified either by the external\nauditor or internal audit function.\n\nThe integrity of financial statements depends\non the auditor being free of any impediments\nto being an effective check on management. To\nthat end, it is important that\nauditors are, and are seen to be, independent.\nWhere an audit firm provides services to the\ncompany in addition to the audit, we look for\nthe fees earned to be disclosed and explained.\nWe look for Audit committees to have in place\na procedure for\nassessing annually the independence of the\nauditor and the quality of the external audit\nprocess.\n\nComprehensive disclosure provides investors\nwith a sense of the\ncompany\u0092s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u0092s oversight. We look to\nthe audit or risk committee to periodically\nreview the company\u0092s risk assessment and risk\nmanagement\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u0092s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that\ncompanies are not adequately managing risk.\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions\n\nThe capital structure of a company is critical\nto shareholders as it impacts the value of\ntheir investment and the priority of their\ninterest in the company relative to\nthat of other equity or debt investors. Pre-\nemptive rights are a key protection for\nshareholders against the dilution of their\ninterests.\n\nEffective voting rights are basic rights of\nshare ownership and a core principle of\neffective governance. Shareholders, as the\nresidual claimants, have the strongest\ninterest in protecting the financial value of\nthe company, and voting rights should match\neconomic exposure, i.e. one share, one vote.\n\nIn principle, we disagree\nwith the creation of a share class with\nequivalent economic exposure and preferential,\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nthis structure violates the fundamental\ncorporate governance principle of\nproportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have\na valid argument for listing dual classes of\nshares with differentiated voting rights. In\nour view, such companies should review these\nshare class structures on a regular basis or\nas company circumstances change. Additionally,\nthey should seek\nshareholder approval of their capital\nstructure on a periodic basis via a\n\nEnterprise risk management is a process,\neffected by the entity\u0092s board of directors,\nmanagement, and other\npersonnel, applied in strategy setting and\nacross the enterprise, designed to identify\npotential events that may affect the entity,\nand manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of\nobjectives. Please see the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO), \u0093\u0094, 2023.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0            Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment\u00a0           8                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nmanagement proposal at the company\u0092s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or\nphase out controlling structures at the\nappropriate time, while minimizing costs to\nshareholders.\n\nIn assessing mergers, asset sales, or other\nspecial transactions,\nBlackRock\u0092s primary consideration is the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients as\nshareholders. Boards proposing a transaction\nshould clearly explain the economic and\nstrategic rationale behind it. We will review\na proposed transaction to\ndetermine the degree to which it can enhance\nlong-term shareholder value. We find long-term\ninvestors like our clients typically benefit\nwhen proposed transactions have the unanimous\nsupport of the board and have been negotiated\nat arm\u0092s\nlength. We may seek reassurance from the board\nthat the financial interests of executives\nand/or board members in a given transaction\nhave not adversely affected their ability to\nplace shareholders\u0092 interests before their\nown. Where the\ntransaction involves related parties, the\nrecommendation to support should come from the\nindependent directors, a best practice in most\nmarkets, and ideally, the terms should have\nbeen assessed through an independent appraisal\nprocess. In addition,\nit is good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\n\nAs a matter of sound governance\npractice, shareholders should have a right to\ndispose of company shares in the open market\nwithout unnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u0092 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic\nproperty rights. Such mechanisms can serve to\nprotect and entrench interests other than\nthose of the shareholders. In our view,\nshareholders are broadly capable of making\ndecisions in their own best interests. We\nencourage any so-called \u0093shareholder rights\nplans\u0094 proposed by a board to be subject to\nshareholder approval upon introduction and\nperiodically thereafter.\n\nExecutive compensation\n\nIn most markets, one\nof the most important roles for a company\u0092s\nboard of directors is to put in place a\ncompensation structure that incentivizes and\nrewards executives appropriately. Executive\ncompensation is an important tool used by\ncompanies to support\nlong-term financial value creation. In our\nexperience, well-structured compensation\npolicies reward the successful delivery of\nstrategic, operational, and/or financial\ngoals, encourage an appropriate risk appetite,\nand align the interests of\nshareholders and executives through equity\nownership.\n\nWe look for there to be a clear link between\nvariable pay and operational and financial\nperformance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u0092s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on whether\ncompanies should use sustainability-related\ncriteria in compensation structures, but,\nwhere they are\nincluded, we look to companies to be as\nrigorous as they would be in setting other\nfinancial or operational targets. Long-term\nincentive plans should encompass timeframes\nthat 1) are distinct from annual executive\ncompensation structures and\nmetrics, and 2) encourage the delivery of\nstrong financial results over a period of\nyears.\n\nWhen designing, reviewing, and approving\nexecutive compensation policies,\nboard compensation committees \u0096 or board\nmembers responsible for setting executive\ncompensation \u0096 should carefully consider the\ncompany\u0092s specific circumstances, such as its\nrisk profile, the environment in which it\noperates, and the\nindividuals the board is trying to attract,\nretain and incentivize. We look to the\ncompensation committees to guard against\ncontractual arrangements that would entitle\nexecutives to material compensation for early\ntermination of their employment.\nFinally, pension contributions and other\ndeferred compensation arrangements should be\nreasonable in light of market practices or the\ncompany\u0092s business and executive compensation\nstrategies.\n\nWe are not supportive of one-off or special\nbonuses unrelated to company or individual\nperformance. Where discretion has been\nused by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we appreciate disclosure relating\nto how and why the discretion was used, and\nhow the adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group\nevaluation by compensation committees can help\nensure competitive pay; however, we are\nconcerned when the rationale for increases\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0            Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment\u00a0           9                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nin total compensation at a company is solely\nbased on peer benchmarking, rather than also\nconsidering rigorous measures of\noutperformance. We encourage companies to\nclearly explain how\ncompensation outcomes have rewarded\nperformance.\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could\nclawback compensation or require executives to\nforgo awards when compensation was based on\nfaulty financial statements or deceptive\nbusiness practices. We also favor recoupment\nfrom or the foregoing of the grant of any\nawards by any senior executive\nwhose behavior caused material financial harm\nto shareholders, material reputational risk to\nthe company, or resulted in a criminal\ninvestigation, even if such actions did not\nultimately result in a material restatement of\npast results.\n\nIn our view, non-executive directors should be\ncompensated in a manner that is commensurate\nwith the time and effort expended in\nfulfilling their professional\nresponsibilities. Additionally, these\ncompensation arrangements should not risk\ncompromising directors\u0092 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith\noverseeing.\n\nBIS may convey concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u0092s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote\nagainst members of the compensation committee\nor equivalent board members for poor\ncompensation practices or structures.\n\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities\n\nIt is our view that well-managed companies\nwill effectively evaluate and manage material\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nrelevant to their businesses. As with all\nrisks and opportunities in a company\u0092s\nbusiness model, appropriate oversight of\nmaterial sustainability considerations is a\ncore component of having an effective\ngovernance framework\nthat supports durable, long-term financial\nvalue creation.\n\nRobust disclosure allows investors to\neffectively evaluate companies\u0092 strategy and\nbusiness\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. We find it\nhelpful when companies\u0092 disclosures\ndemonstrate that they have a resilient\nbusiness model that integrates material\nsustainability-related risks and\nopportunities into their strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and\nS2 may prove helpful to companies in preparing\nthis disclosure. The standards build on the\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD) framework and the standards\nand metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have both\nconverged under the ISSB. We recognize that\ncompanies may phase in reporting aligned with\nthe ISSB standards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of voluntary standards. In such cases,\nwe ask that companies highlight the metrics\nthat are industry- or company-specific.\n\nWe note that climate and other sustainability-\nrelated disclosures often require companies to\ncollect and aggregate data from various\ninternal and external sources. We\nrecognize that the practical realities of data\ncollection and reporting may not line up with\nfinancial reporting cycles and companies may\nrequire additional time after their fiscal\nyear-end to accurately\ncollect, analyze, and report this data to\ninvestors. That said, while we do not\nprescribe timelines regarding when companies\nmake these disclosures, we encourage them to\nproduce climate and other sustainability-\nrelated disclosures sufficiently in\nadvance of their annual meeting, to the best\nof their abilities to provide investors with\ntime to assess the data and make informed\ndecisions.\n\nBy material sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in a company\u0092s\nbusiness model that have an environmental or\nsocial dependency or impact. Examples of\nenvironmental issues\ninclude, but are not limited to, water use,\nland use, waste management, and climate risk.\nExamples of social issues include, but are not\nlimited to, human capital management, impacts\non the communities in which a company\noperates, customer loyalty,\nand relationships with regulators.\n\nThe objective of General Requirements for\nDisclosure of\nSustainability-related Financial Information\nis to require an entity to disclose\ninformation about its sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating\nto providing resources to the entity. The\nobjective of Climate-related Disclosures is to\nrequire an entity to disclose information\nabout its climate-related risks and\nopportunities that is useful\nto primary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0             Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment\u00a0            10                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by\nsupranational organizations such as the United\nNations or the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development. Further, industry\ninitiatives on managing specific operational\nrisks may provide useful guidance to companies\non best practices and\ndisclosures. While not a voting item, we find\nit helpful to our understanding of investment\nrisk when companies disclose any relevant\nglobal climate and other sustainability-\nrelated standards adopted, the industry\ninitiatives in which they\nparticipate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices.\n\nClimate and nature-related risk\n\nIn our view, the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy is one of several mega forces\nreshaping markets. Our research shows that the\nlow-carbon transition is\na structural shift in the global economy that\nwill be shaped by changes in government\npolicies, technology, and consumer and\ninvestor preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. Yet\nthe path to a low-carbon economy is uncertain\nand uneven, with different parts of the\neconomy moving at different speeds. BIS\nrecognizes that it can be challenging for\ncompanies to predict the impact of\nclimate-related risk and opportunity on their\nbusinesses and operating environments. Many\ncompanies are assessing how to navigate the\nlow-carbon transition while delivering long-\nterm financial value to\ninvestors. At companies where these climate-\nrelated risks are material, we find it helpful\nwhen they publicly disclose, consistent with\ntheir business model and sector, how they\nintend to deliver long-term financial\nperformance through the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, including\nwhere available, their transition plan.\n\nIn our experience, disclosure consistent with\nthe ISSB standards or the TCFD framework can\nhelp investors assess company-specific\nclimate-related risks and\nopportunities, and inform investment\ndecisions. Such disclosures also provide\ninvestors with insights into how companies are\nmanaging the risks associated with climate\nchange by managing their\nown carbon emissions or emissions intensities\nto the extent financially practicable.\nRecognizing the value of these disclosures, in\nsome jurisdictions, like the U.K, large\ncompanies must disclose such climate-related\nfinancial information on a\nmandatory basis, while in other jurisdictions\nthese disclosures are viewed as best practice\nin the market.\n\nConsistent with the ISSB standards and the\nTCFD\nframework, we seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related\nscenarios. This includes a scenario in which\nglobal warming is limited to well below 2\u00b0C,\nconsidering ambitions to achieve a limit of\n1.5\u00b0C, the temperature goal recently\nreaffirmed by G20 members as part of the 2024\nLeader\u0092s\nDeclaration.\n\nBlackRock Investment Institute, \u0093Mega forces:\nAn investment opportunity\u0094, 2023.\n\nBlackRock\nInvestment Institute, \u0093Tracking the low-carbon\ntransition\u0094, July 2023.\n\nWe have observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policymakers\nin are signaling their intentions to require\nthem or already have requirements in\nplace, such as Australia, Brazil, and the\nEuropean Union. We view transition plans as a\nmethod for a company to both internally assess\nand externally communicate its long-term\nstrategy, ambition, objectives, and actions to\ncreate financial\nvalue through the global transition towards a\nlow-carbon economy. Transition plans are\nbuilding momentum internationally, with\nincreased focus from policy makers and\nsupervisors, including in the EU,\nUK, G7, G20, and from the financial industry.\nWhile many initiatives across jurisdictions\noutline a framework for transition plans,\nthere is no consensus on the key elements\nthese plans should contain. We view useful\ndisclosure as one\nthat communicates a company\u0092s approach to\nmanaging financially material business\nrelevant risks and opportunities \u0096 including\nclimate-related risks \u0096 to deliver long-term\nfinancial performance, which allows investors\nto make more\ninformed decisions. While transition plans can\nbe helpful disclosure, BIS does not make the\npreparation and production of transition plans\na voting issue. BIS may engage companies that\nhave chosen to publish a transition plan to\nunderstand their\nplanned actions and resource implications.\n\nBlackRock, \u0093Global perspectives on investing\nin the low-carbon transition\u0094, June 2023. We\nrecognize that companies may phase in\nreporting aligned with the ISSB standards over\nseveral years, depending on local\nrequirements. We also recognize and respect\nthat some\ncompanies may report using different local\nstandards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies disclose their rationale for\nreporting in line with the specific disclosure\nframework chosen and highlight the metrics\nthat are industry- or company-specific.\n\nIn November 2024, G20\nmembers reaffirmed the Paris Agreement\ntemperature goal as part of the . G20 members\ninclude the world\u0092s major economies (19\ncountries and two regional bodies, the\nEuropean Union and African Union),\nrepresenting 85% of global Gross Domestic\nProduct, over 75% of international trade, and\nabout two-thirds of the world population.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0             Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment\u00a0            11                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nThese frameworks also contemplate disclosures\non how companies are setting short-, medium-\nand long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors.\n\nWhile we recognize that regulators in some\nmarkets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding material scope 3\nemissions and recognize\nthese are provided on a good-faith basis as\nmethodology develops. Our publicly available\ncommentary provides more information on our\napproach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities.\n\nIn addition to climate-related risks and\nopportunities, the management of nature-\nrelated factors is increasingly a component of\nsome companies\u0092 ability to generate\ndurable, long-term financial returns for\nshareholders, particularly where a company\u0092s\nstrategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for\nsuch\n\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics\nand targets, to understand how these factors\nare integrated into strategy. We will evaluate\nthese disclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities. We rely on company\ndisclosures when\ndetermining how to vote on shareholder\nproposals addressing natural capital issues.\nOur publicly available provides more\ninformation on our approach to natural\ncapital.\n\nCompanies\u0092 impact on their workforce, supply\nchains, and communities\n\nIn\norder to advance long-term shareholders\u0092\ninterests, companies should consider the\ninterests of the various parties on whom they\ndepend for their success over time. It is for\neach company to determine their key\nstakeholders based on what is\nmaterial to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they\noperate.\n\nAs a long-term shareholder on behalf of our\nclients, we find it helpful when companies\ndisclose how they have identified their key\nstakeholders and\nconsidered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies discuss how they\nconsider the needs of their workforce today,\nand the skills required for\ntheir future business strategy. We are also\ninterested to understand how the board\nmonitors and engages on these matters, given\nit is well positioned to ensure that the\napproach taken by management is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u0092s\nstrategy.\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships\nwith their stakeholders. We encourage\ncompanies to implement, to the extent\nappropriate, monitoring processes (often\nreferred to as due diligence) to identify and\nmitigate potential adverse impacts and\ngrievance mechanisms to remediate any actual\nadverse material impacts. In our view,\nmaintaining trust within these relationships\ncan contribute to a company\u0092s long-term\nsuccess.\n\nGiven the growing awareness of the materiality\nof these issues for certain businesses,\nenhanced reporting on a company\u0092s natural\ncapital dependencies and impacts would aid\ninvestors\u0092 understanding. In our view, the\nfinal recommendations of\nthe (TNFD) may prove useful to some companies.\nWe recognize that some companies may report\nusing different standards, which may be\nrequired by regulation, or one of a number of\nother private\nsector standards. TNFD-aligned reporting is\nnot a voting issue.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0             Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment\u00a0            12                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nOther corporate governance matters and\nshareholder protections\n\nIn our view, shareholders have a right to\nmaterial and timely information on the\nfinancial performance and viability of the\ncompanies in which they invest. In addition,\ncompanies should publish information on the\ngovernance structures in place and the rights\nof shareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the\nboard\u0092s oversight of management and whether\ninvestors\u0092 economic interests have been\nprotected. As a general principle, we believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to\ngovernance mechanisms, to submit proposals to\nthe shareholders\u0092 meeting, and to call special\nmeetings of shareholders.\n\nCorporate form\n\nIn our view, it is the responsibility of the\nboard to determine the corporate form that is\nmost appropriate given the company\u0092s purpose\nand business model. Companies proposing to\nchange their corporate form to a public\nbenefit corporation or similar entity should\nput it to a shareholder vote if not already\nrequired to do so under applicable\nlaw. We appreciate when supporting\ndocumentation from companies or shareholder\nproponents proposing to alter the corporate\nform clearly explains how the interests of\nshareholders and different stakeholders would\nbe impacted as well as the\naccountability and voting mechanisms that\nwould be available to shareholders. We\ngenerally support management proposals if our\nanalysis indicates that shareholders\u0092 economic\ninterests are adequately protected. Relevant\nshareholder proposals are\nevaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nShareholder proposals\n\nIn most markets in which BlackRock invests on\nbehalf of clients, shareholders have the right\nto submit proposals to be voted on at a\ncompany\u0092s\nannual or extraordinary meeting, as long as\neligibility and procedural requirements are\nmet. The matters that we see put forward by\nshareholders address a wide range of topics,\nincluding governance reforms, capital\nmanagement, and improvements in\nthe management or disclosure of\nsustainability-related risks.\n\nBlackRock is subject to legal and regulatory\nrequirements in the U.S. that place\nrestrictions and\nlimitations on how BlackRock can interact with\nthe companies in which we invest on behalf of\nour clients, including our ability to submit\nshareholder proposals. We can vote, on behalf\nof clients who authorize us to do so, on\nproposals put forth by\nothers.\n\nWhen assessing shareholder proposals, we\nevaluate each proposal on its merit,\nconsidering the company\u0092s individual\ncircumstances and maintaining a\nsingular focus on the proposal\u0092s implications\nfor long-term financial value creation. BIS\u0092\nevaluation considers whether a shareholder\nproposal addresses a material risk that, if\nleft unmanaged, may impact a company\u0092s long-\nterm\nperformance. We look for consistency between\nthe specific request formally made in the\nproposal, the supporting documentation and the\nproponents\u0092 other communications on the\nissues. We also assess the company\u0092s practices\nand\ndisclosures and the costs and benefits to the\ncompany of meeting the request made in the\nproposal. We take into consideration a\ncompany\u0092s governance practices and disclosures\nagainst those of their peers.\n\nIn our experience, it is helpful when\ncompanies disclose the names of the proponent\nor organization that has submitted or advised\non the proposal.\n\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company, are unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on\nmanagement. We take into consideration the\nlegal effect of the proposal, as shareholder\nproposals may be advisory or legally binding\ndepending on the jurisdiction, while others\nmay make requests that would be deemed illegal\nin a given jurisdiction.\n\nCorporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0             Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment\u00a0            13                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nBIS is likely to support shareholder proposals\nthat request disclosures that help us, as\nlong-term investors on behalf of\nour clients, better understand the material\nrisks and opportunities companies face and how\nthey are managing them, especially where this\ninformation is additive given the company\u0092s\nexisting disclosures. We may also support\nshareholder proposals\nthat are focused on a material business risk\nthat we agree needs to be addressed and the\nintended outcome is consistent with long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\nWe\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests.\nFurther, the proponent\u0092s supporting statement\nmay refer to topics that are not directly\nrelated to the request made in the proposal.\nIn voting on behalf of\nclients, we do not submit or edit proposals or\nthe supporting statements \u0096 we must vote yes\nor no on the proposal as phrased by the\nproponent. Therefore, when we vote in support\nof a proposal, we are not necessarily\nendorsing every element of\nthe proposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients\u0092\nlong-term financial interests. We typically\nexplain to the company our rationale for\nsupporting such proposals.\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst\nthe election of one or more directors if, in\nour assessment, the board has not responded\nsufficiently or with an appropriate sense of\nurgency to a material risk. We may also\nsupport a proposal if management is on track,\nbut we believe that voting in\nfavor might accelerate efforts to address a\nmaterial risk.\n\nBlackRock\u0092s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities\n\nOversight\n\nBlackRock maintains advisory committees\n(Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees), generally consisting of\nsenior BlackRock index investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines). The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS.\n\nIn addition to the Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of the Global Head of\nInvestment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nsenior BlackRock executives with legal,\nrisk and other experience relevant to team\noversight. The Global Committee does not\ndetermine voting decisions, which are the\nresponsibility of BIS.\n\nThe Global Head\nhas primary oversight of the activities of\nBIS, including voting in accordance with the\nGuidelines, which require the application of\nprofessional judgment and consideration of\neach company\u0092s unique circumstances. The\nGlobal Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines.\n\nIn addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines.\n\nBIS carries out engagement with companies,\nexecutes proxy votes, and conducts vote\noperations (including maintaining records of\nvotes\ncast) in a manner consistent with the relevant\nGuidelines. BIS also conducts research on\ncorporate governance issues and participates\nin industry discussions to contribute to and\nkeep abreast of important developments in the\ncorporate governance\nfield. BIS may utilize third parties for\ncertain of the foregoing activities and\nperforms oversight of those third parties. BIS\nmay discuss complicated or particularly\ncontroversial matters with senior specialists\ninternally, on an advisory basis,\nprior to making a voting decision.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0             Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment\u00a0            14                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nVoting guidelines and vote execution\n\nBlackRock votes on proxy issues when our\nclients authorize us to do so. We carefully\nconsider proxies submitted to funds and other\nfiduciary account(s) (Fund or Funds)\nfor which we have voting authority. BlackRock\nvotes (or refrains from voting) proxies for\neach Fund for which we have voting authority\nbased on our evaluation of the alignment of\nthe voting items with the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients,\nin the exercise of our independent business\njudgment, and without regard to the\nrelationship of the issuer of the proxy (or\nany shareholder proponent or dissident\nshareholder) to the Fund, the Fund\u0092s\naffiliates (if any), BlackRock or\nBlackRock\u0092s affiliates, or BlackRock employees\n(see \u0093Conflicts management policies and\nprocedures,\u0094 below).\n\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Principles.\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u0092s general\nphilosophy and approach to issues that may\ncommonly arise in the proxy voting context in\neach market where we invest. The Guidelines\nare not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies\nthe Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather,\nthey reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. The\nGuidelines are reviewed annually and updated\nas necessary to reflect changes\nin market practices, developments in corporate\ngovernance and feedback from companies and\nclients. In this way, BIS aims to maintain\npolicies that explain our approach to\ngovernance practices most aligned with\nclients\u0092 long-term financial\ninterests. BIS analysts may exercise their\nprofessional judgment in determining how to\nvote if they conclude that the Guidelines do\nnot cover the specific matter raised by a\nballot item or that an exception to the\nGuidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u0092s\nclients.\n\nIn certain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u0092\nability to vote\nsuch proxies, as well as the desirability of\nvoting such proxies.

Securities lending is a\nwell-regulated practice that contributes to\ncapital market efficiency. It also enables\nfunds to generate additional returns while\nallowing fund providers to\nkeep fund expenses lower.\n\nWith regard to the relationship between\nsecurities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock\ncannot vote shares on loan and may determine\nto\nrecall them for voting, as guided by our\nfiduciary duty as an asset manager to our\nclients in helping them achieve their\ninvestment goals. While this has occurred in a\nlimited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u0092s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to\nclients of voting those securities (based on\nthe information available at the time of\nrecall consideration). BIS works with\n\nRecalling securities on loan can be impacted\nby the timing of record dates. In the U.S.,\nfor example, the record date of a shareholder\nmeeting typically falls before the proxy\nstatements are released. Accordingly, it is\nnot practicable to evaluate a\nproxy statement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to\na fund\u0092s shareholders of recalling loaned\nshares in advance of an estimated record date\nwithout knowing whether there will be a vote\non matters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for\nthe fund\u0092s shareholders) or leaving shares on\nloan to potentially earn revenue for the fund\n(thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0             Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment\u00a0            17                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \ncolleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk\nand Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate\nthe costs and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan.\n\nIn almost all instances, BlackRock anticipates\nthat the potential long-term financial value\nto the Fund of voting shares would be less\nthan the potential revenue the\nloan may provide the Fund. However, in certain\ninstances, BlackRock may determine, in our\nindependent business judgment as a fiduciary,\nthat the value of voting outweighs the\nsecurities lending revenue loss to clients and\nwould therefore recall\nshares to be voted in those instances.\n\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may\nmodify it as necessary.\n\nReporting and vote transparency\n\nWe are committed to transparency in the\nstewardship work we do on behalf of clients.\nWe inform clients about our engagement and\nvoting policies and activities through\ndirect communication and through disclosure on\nour . Additionally, we make public our\nregional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to\nshare our perspective on market developments\nand emerging key themes.\n\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany\nthat held a shareholder meeting during the\nperiod, showing how BIS voted on each proposal\nand providing our rationale for any votes\nagainst management proposals and on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high\nprofile or of significant interest to clients,\nwe may publish a vote bulletin after the\nmeeting, disclosing and explaining our vote on\nkey proposals. We also publish a quarterly\nlist of all companies with which we engaged\nand the key topics\naddressed in the engagement meeting.\n\nIn this way, we help inform our clients about\nthe work we do on their behalf in promoting\nthe governance and business practices\nthat support durable, long-term financial\nvalue creation by companies.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0             Global\u00a0Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment\u00a0            18                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nWant to know more?\n\n|\n\nThis\ndocument is provided for information and\neducational purposes only.

This year we\u0092ve made noteworthy\nrevisions in the following areas, which are\nsummarized below but discussed in greater\ndetail in the relevant section of this\ndocument:\n\nUpdate: 20 December 2024. We have removed our\ndiscussion on page 42 of stock exchange\ndiversity disclosure requirements.\n\nBoard Oversight of AI\n\nWe have included a new discussion on our\napproach to artificial intelligence\n(AI)-related risk oversight. In recent years,\ncompanies have rapidly begun to develop and\nadopt uses for artificial intelligence (AI)\ntechnologies throughout various aspects of\ntheir operations. Deployed and overseen\neffectively, AI technologies have the\npotential to make companies\u0092 operations and\nsystems more efficient and productive.\nHowever, as the use of these technologies has\ngrown, so have the potential risks associated\nwith companies\u0092 development and use of AI.\nGiven these potential risks, the benchmark\npolicy takes the view that boards should be\ncognizant of, and take steps to mitigate\nexposure to, any material risks that could\narise from their use or development of AI.\n\nIn the absence of material incidents related\nto a company\u0092s use or management of AI-\nrelatedissues, our benchmark policy will\ngenerally not make voting recommendations on\nthe basis of a company\u0092s oversight of, or\ndisclosure concerning, AI-relatedissues.\nHowever, in instances where there is evidence\nthat insufficient oversight and/or management\nof AI technologies has resulted in material\nharm to shareholders, Glass Lewis will review\na company\u0092s overall governance practices and\nidentify which directors or board-level\ncommittees have been charged with oversight of\nAI-relatedrisks. We will also closely evaluate\nthe board\u0092s response to, and management of,\nthis issue as well as any associated\ndisclosures and the benchmark policy may\nrecommend against appropriate directors should\nwe find the board\u0092s oversight, response or\ndisclosure concerning AI-relatedissues to be\ninsufficient.\n\nChange-In-ControlProvisions\n\nWe have updated our discussion of change-in-\ncontrolprovisions in the section \u0093The Link\nBetween Compensation and Performance\u0094 to\ndefine our benchmark policy view that\ncompanies that allow for committee discretion\nover the treatment of unvested awards should\ncommit to providing clear rationale for how\nsuch awards are treated in the event a change\nin control occurs.\n\nClarifying Amendments\n\nThe following clarifications of our existing\npolicies are included this year:\n\nBoard Responsiveness to Shareholder Proposals\n\nWe have revised our discussion of board\nresponsiveness to shareholder proposal to\nreflect that when shareholder proposals\nreceive significant shareholder support\n(generally more than 30% but less than\nmajority of votes cast), the benchmark policy\ngenerally takes the view that boards should\nengage with shareholders on the issue and\nprovide disclosure addressing shareholder\nconcerns and outreach initiatives.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                   3  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nReincorporation\n\nWe have revised our discussion on\nreincorporations to reflect that we review all\nproposals to reincorporate to a different\nstate or country on a case-by-casebasis. Our\nreview includes the changes in corporate\ngovernance provisions, especially those\nrelating to shareholder rights, material\ndifferences in corporate statutes and legal\nprecedents, and relevant financial benefits,\namong other factors, resulting from the change\nin domicile.\n\nApproach to Executive Pay Program\n\nWe have provided some clarifying statements to\nthe discussion of in the section titled \u0093The\nLink Between Compensation and Performance\u0094 to\nemphasize Glass Lewis\u0092 holistic approach to\nanalyzing executive compensation programs.\nThere are few program features that, on their\nown, lead to an unfavorable recommendation\nfrom Glass Lewis for a say-on-payproposal. Our\nanalysis reviews pay programs on a case-by-\ncasebasis. We do not utilize a pre-\ndeterminedscorecard approach when considering\nindividual features such as the allocation of\nthe long-term incentive between performance-\nbased awards and time-based awards.\nUnfavorable factors in a pay program are\nreviewed in the context of rationale, overall\nstructure, overall disclosure quality, the\nprogram\u0092s ability to align executive pay with\nperformance and the shareholder experience and\nthe trajectory of the pay program resulting\nfrom changes introduced by the compensation\ncommittee.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                   4  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nA Board of Directors that Serves Shareholder\nInterest\n\nElection of Directors\n\nThe purpose of Glass Lewis\u0092 proxy research and\nadvice is to facilitate shareholder voting in\nfavor of governance structures that will drive\nperformance, create shareholder value and\nmaintain a proper tone at the top. Glass Lewis\nlooks for talented boards with a record of\nprotecting shareholders and delivering value\nover the medium- and long-term. We believe\nthat a board can best protect and enhance the\ninterests of shareholders if it is\nsufficiently independent, has a record of\npositive performance, and consists of\nindividuals with diverse backgrounds and a\nbreadth and depth of relevant experience.\n\nIndependence\n\nThe independence of directors, or lack\nthereof, is ultimately demonstrated through\nthe decisions they make. In assessing the\nindependence of directors, we will take into\nconsideration, when appropriate, whether a\ndirector has a track record indicative of\nmaking objective decisions. Likewise, when\nassessing the independence of directors we\nwill also examine when a director\u0092s track\nrecord on multiple boards indicates a lack of\nobjective decision-making. Ultimately, we\nbelieve the determination of whether a\ndirector is independent or not must take into\nconsideration both compliance with the\napplicable independence listing requirements\nas well as judgments made by the director.\n\nWe look at each director nominee to examine\nthe director\u0092s relationships with the company,\nthe company\u0092s executives, and other directors.\nWe do this to evaluate whether personal,\nfamilial, or financial relationships (not\nincluding director compensation) may impact\nthe director\u0092s decisions. We believe that such\nrelationships make it difficult for a director\nto put shareholders\u0092 interests above the\ndirector\u0092s or the related party\u0092s interests.\nWe also believe that a director who owns more\nthan 20% of a company can exert\ndisproportionate influence on the board, and\ntherefore believe such a director\u0092s\nindependence may be hampered, in particular\nwhen serving on the audit committee.\n\nThus, we put directors into three categories\nbased on an examination of the type of\nrelationship they have with the company:\n\nIndependent Director\u0097 An independent director\nhas no material financial, familial or other\ncurrent relationships with the company, its\nexecutives, or other board members, except for\nboard service and standard fees paid for that\nservice. Relationships that existed within\nthree to five years 1before the\n\ninquiry are usually considered \u0093current\u0094 for\npurposes of this test. For material financial\nrelationships with the company, we apply a\nthree-year look back, and for former\nemployment relationships with the company, we\napply a five-year look back.\n\n1NASDAQ originally proposed a five-year look-\nback period but both it and the NYSE\nultimately settled on a three-year look-back\nprior to finalizing their rules. A five-year\nstandard for former employment relationships\nis more appropriate, in our view, because we\nbelieve that the unwinding of conflicting\nrelationships between former management and\nboard members is more likely to be complete\nand final after five years. However, Glass\nLewis does not apply the five-year look-back\nperiod to directors who have previously served\nas executives of the company on an interim\nbasis for less than one year.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                   5  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nAffiliated Director\u0097 An affiliated director\nhas, (or within the past three years, had) a\nmaterial financial, familial or other\nrelationship with the company or its\nexecutives, but is not an employee of the\ncompany. 2This includes directors whose\nemployers have a material financial\nrelationship with the company. 3In addition,\nwe view a director who either owns or controls\n20% or more of the company\u0092s voting stock, or\nis an employee or affiliate of an entity that\ncontrols such amount, as an affiliate. 4\n\nWe view 20% shareholders as affiliates because\nthey typically have access to and involvement\nwith the management of a company that is\nfundamentally different from that of ordinary\nshareholders. More importantly, 20% holders\nmay have interests that diverge from those of\nordinary holders, for reasons such as the\nliquidity (or lack thereof) of their holdings,\npersonal tax issues, etc.\n\nGlass Lewis applies a three-year look back\nperiod to all directors who have an\naffiliation with the company other than former\nemployment, for which we apply a five-year\nlook back.\n\nDefinition of \u0093Material\u0094: A material\nrelationship is one in which the dollar value\nexceeds:\n                                              \n      $50,000 (or where no amount is          \n      disclosed) for directors who are paid   \n      for a service they have agreed          \n      to perform for the company, outside of  \n      their service as a director, including  \n      professional or other services. This    \n      threshold also applies to directors     \n      who are the majority or principal       \n      owner of a firm that receives such      \n      payments; or                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      $120,000 (or where no amount is         \n      disclosed) for those directors          \n      employed by a professional services     \n      firm such as a law firm, investment     \n      bank, or consulting firm and the        \n      company pays the firm, not the          \n      individual, for services.5 This dollar  \n      limit would also apply to charitable    \n      contributions to                        \n      schools where a board member is a       \n      professor; or charities where a         \n      director serves on the board or is an   \n      executive;6 and any aircraft and real   \n      estate dealings between the company     \n      and the                                 \n      director\u0092s firm; or                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      1% of either company\u0092s consolidated      \n      gross revenue for other business        \n      relationships (e.g., where              \n      the director is an executive officer    \n      of a company that provides services or  \n      products to or receives services or     \n      products from the company).7            \n                                              \n2If a company does not consider a non-\nemployeedirector to be independent, Glass\nLewis will classify that director as an\naffiliate.\n\n3We allow a five-year grace period for former\nexecutives of the company or merged companies\nwho have consulting agreements with the\nsurviving company. (We do not automatically\nrecommend voting against directors in such\ncases for the first five years.) If the\nconsulting agreement persists after this five-\nyear grace period, we apply the materiality\nthresholds outlined in the definition of\n\u0093material.\u0094\n\n4This includes a director who serves on a\nboard as a representative (as part of his or\nher basic responsibilities) of an investment\nfirm with greater than 20% ownership. However,\nwhile we will generally consider him/her to be\naffiliated, we will not recommend voting\nagainst unless (i) the investment firm has\ndisproportionate board representation or (ii)\nthe director serves on the audit committee.\n\n5We may deem such a transaction to be\nimmaterial where the amount represents less\nthan 1% of the firm\u0092s annual revenues and the\nboard provides a compelling rationale as to\nwhy the director\u0092s independence is not\naffected by the relationship.\n\n6We will generally take into consideration the\nsize and nature of such charitable entities in\nrelation to the company\u0092s size and industry\nalong with any other relevant factors such as\nthe director\u0092s role at the charity. However,\nunlike for other types of related party\ntransactions, Glass Lewis generally does not\napply a look-back period to affiliated\nrelationships involving charitable\ncontributions; if the relationship between the\ndirector and the school or charity ceases, or\nif the company discontinues its donations to\nthe entity, we will consider the director to\nbe independent.\n\n7This includes cases where a director is\nemployed by, or closely affiliated with, a\nprivate equity firm that profits from an\nacquisition made by the company. Unless\ndisclosure suggests otherwise, we presume the\ndirector is affiliated.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                   6  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nDefinition of \u0093Familial\u0094\u0097 Familial\nrelationships include a person\u0092s spouse,\nparents, children, siblings, grandparents,\nuncles, aunts, cousins, nieces, nephews, in-\nlaws,and anyone (other than domestic\nemployees) who shares such person\u0092s home. A\ndirector is an affiliate if: i) he or she has\na family member who is employed by the company\nand receives more than $120,000 8in annual\ncompensation; or, ii) he or she has a family\nmember who is employed by the company and the\ncompany does not disclose this individual\u0092s\ncompensation.\n\nDefinition of \u0093Company\u0094\u0097 A company includes\nany parent or subsidiary in a group with the\ncompany or any entity that merged with, was\nacquired by, or acquired the company.\n\nInside Director\u0097 An inside director\nsimultaneously serves as a director and as an\nemployee of the company. This category may\ninclude a board chair who acts as an employee\nof the company or is paid as an employee of\nthe company. In our view, an inside director\nwho derives a greater amount of income as a\nresult of affiliated transactions with the\ncompany rather than through compensation paid\nby the company (i.e., salary, bonus, etc. as a\ncompany employee) faces a conflict between\nmaking decisions that are in the best\ninterests of the company versus those in the\ndirector\u0092s own best interests. Therefore, we\nwill recommend voting against such a director.\n\nAdditionally, we believe a director who is\ncurrently serving in an interim management\nposition should be considered an insider,\nwhile a director who previously served in an\ninterim management position for less than one\nyear and is no longer serving in such capacity\nis considered independent. Moreover, a\ndirector who previously served in an interim\nmanagement position for over one year and is\nno longer serving in such capacity is\nconsidered an affiliate for five years\nfollowing the date of the director\u0092s\nresignation or departure from the interim\nmanagement position.\n\nVoting Recommendations on the Basis of Board\nIndependence\n\nGlass Lewis believes a board will be most\neffective in protecting shareholders\u0092\ninterests if it is at least two-\nthirdsindependent. We note that each of the\nBusiness Roundtable, the Conference Board, and\nthe Council of Institutional Investors\nadvocates that two-thirdsof the board be\nindependent. Where more than one-thirdof the\nmembers are affiliated or inside directors, we\ntypically 8recommend voting against some of\nthe inside and/or affiliated directors in\norder to satisfy the two-thirdsthreshold.\n\nIn the case of a less than two-\nthirdsindependent board, Glass Lewis strongly\nsupports the existence of a presiding or lead\ndirector with authority to set the meeting\nagendas and to lead sessions outside the\ninsider chair\u0092s presence.\n\nIn addition, we scrutinize avowedly\n\u0093independent\u0094 chairs and lead directors. We\nbelieve that they should be unquestionably\nindependent, or the company should not tout\nthem as such.\n\n8Pursuant to SEC rule Item 404 of Regulation\nS-Kunder the Securities Exchange Act,\ncompensation exceeding $120,000 is the minimum\nthreshold deemed material for disclosure of\ntransactions involving family members of\ndirectors.\n\n8With a staggered board, if the affiliates or\ninsiders that we believe should not be on the\nboard are not up for election, we will express\nour concern regarding those directors, but we\nwill not recommend voting against the other\naffiliates or insiders who are up for election\njust to achieve two-thirdsindependence.\nHowever, we will consider recommending voting\nagainst the directors subject to our concern\nat their next election if the issue giving\nrise to the concern is not resolved.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                   7  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nCommittee Independence\n\nWe believe that only independent directors\nshould serve on a company\u0092s audit,\ncompensation, nominating, and governance\ncommittees. 9We typically recommend that\nshareholders vote against any affiliated or\ninside director seeking appointment to an\naudit, compensation, nominating, or governance\ncommittee, or who has served in that capacity\nin the past year.\n\nPursuant to Section 952 of the Dodd-Frank Act,\nas of January 11, 2013, the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC) approved new\nlisting requirements for both the NYSE and\nNASDAQ which require that boards apply\nenhanced standards of independence when making\nan affirmative determination of the\nindependence of compensation committee\nmembers. Specifically, when making this\ndetermination, in addition to the factors\nconsidered when assessing general director\nindependence, the board\u0092s considerations must\ninclude: (i) the source of compensation of the\ndirector, including any consulting, advisory\nor other compensatory fee paid by the listed\ncompany to the director (the \u0093Fees Factor\u0094);\nand (ii) whether the director is affiliated\nwith the listing company, its subsidiaries, or\naffiliates of its subsidiaries (the\n\u0093Affiliation Factor\u0094).\n\nGlass Lewis believes it is important for\nboards to consider these enhanced independence\nfactors when assessing compensation committee\nmembers. However, as discussed above in the\nsection titled Independence, we apply our own\nstandards when assessing the independence of\ndirectors, and these standards also take into\naccount consulting and advisory fees paid to\nthe director, as well as the director\u0092s\naffiliations with the company and its\nsubsidiaries and affiliates. We may recommend\nvoting against compensation committee members\nwho are not independent based on our\nstandards.\n\nIndependent Chair\n\nGlass Lewis believes that separating the roles\nof CEO (or, more rarely, another executive\nposition) and chair creates a better\ngovernance structure than a combined CEO/chair\nposition. An executive manages the business\naccording to a course the board charts.\nExecutives should report to the board\nregarding their performance in achieving goals\nset by the board. This is needlessly\ncomplicated when a CEO chairs the board, since\na CEO/chair presumably will have a significant\ninfluence over the board.\n\nWhile many companies have an independent lead\nor presiding director who performs many of the\nsame functions of an independent chair (e.g.,\nsetting the board meeting agenda), we do not\nbelieve this alternate form of independent\nboard leadership provides as robust protection\nfor shareholders as an independent chair.\n\nIt can become difficult for a board to fulfill\nits role of overseer and policy setter when a\nCEO/chair controls the agenda and the\nboardroom discussion. Such control can allow a\nCEO to have an entrenched position, leading to\nlonger-than-optimal terms, fewer checks on\nmanagement, less scrutiny of the business\noperation, and limitations on independent,\nshareholder-focused goal-setting by the board.\n\nA CEO should set the strategic course for the\ncompany, with the board\u0092s approval, and the\nboard should enable the CEO to carry out the\nCEO\u0092s vision for accomplishing the board\u0092s\nobjectives. Failure to achieve the board\u0092s\nobjectives should lead the board to replace\nthat CEO with someone in whom the board has\nconfidence.\n\nLikewise, an independent chair can better\noversee executives and set a pro-\nshareholderagenda without the management\nconflicts that a CEO and other executive\ninsiders often face. Such oversight and\nconcern for shareholders allows for a more\nproactive and effective board of directors\nthat is better able to look out for the\ninterests of shareholders.\n\n9We will recommend voting against an audit\ncommittee member who owns 20% or more of the\ncompany\u0092s stock, and we believe that there\nshould be a maximum of one director (or no\ndirectors if the committee is composed of less\nthan three directors) who owns 20% or more of\nthe company\u0092s stock on the compensation,\nnominating, and governance committees.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                   8  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nFurther, it is the board\u0092s responsibility to\nselect a chief executive who can best serve a\ncompany and its shareholders and to replace\nthis person when his or her duties have not\nbeen appropriately fulfilled. Such a\nreplacement becomes more difficult and happens\nless frequently when the chief executive is\nalso in the position of overseeing the board.\n\nGlass Lewis believes that the installation of\nan independent chair is almost always a\npositive step from a corporate governance\nperspective and promotes the best interests of\nshareholders. Further, the presence of an\nindependent chair fosters the creation of a\nthoughtful and dynamic board, not dominated by\nthe views of senior management. Encouragingly,\nmany companies appear to be moving in this\ndirection \u0097 one study indicates that only 10\npercent of incoming CEOs in 2014 were awarded\nthe chair title, versus 48 percent in 2002.\n10Another study finds that 53 percent of S&P\n500 boards now separate the CEO and chair\nroles, up from 37 percent in 2009, although\nthe same study found that only 34 percent of\nS&P 500 boards have truly independent chairs.\n11\n\nWe do not recommend that shareholders vote\nagainst CEOs who chair the board. However, we\ntypically recommend that our clients support\nseparating the roles of chair and CEO whenever\nthat question is posed in a proxy (typically\nin the form of a shareholder proposal), as we\nbelieve that it is in the long-term best\ninterests of the company and its shareholders.\n\nFurther, where the company has neither an\nindependent chair nor independent lead\ndirector, we will recommend voting against the\nchair of the governance committee.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe most crucial test of a board\u0092s commitment\nto the company and its shareholders lies in\nthe actions of the board and its members. We\nlook at the performance of these individuals\nas directors and executives of the company and\nof other companies where they have served.\n\nWe find that a director\u0092s past conduct is\noften indicative of future conduct and\nperformance. We often find directors with a\nhistory of overpaying executives or of serving\non boards where avoidable disasters have\noccurred serving on the boards of companies\nwith similar problems. Glass Lewis has a\nproprietary database of directors serving at\nover 8,000 of the most widely held U.S.\ncompanies. We use this database to track the\nperformance of directors across companies.\n\nVoting Recommendations on the Basis of\nPerformance\n\nWe typically recommend that shareholders vote\nagainst directors who have served on boards or\nas executives of companies with records of\npoor performance, inadequate risk oversight,\nexcessive compensation, audit- or accounting-\nrelated issues, and/or other indicators of\nmismanagement or actions against the interests\nof shareholders. We will reevaluate such\ndirectors based on, among other factors, the\nlength of time passed since the incident\ngiving rise to the concern, shareholder\nsupport for the director, the severity of the\nissue, the director\u0092s role (e.g., committee\nmembership), director tenure at the subject\ncompany, whether ethical lapses accompanied\nthe oversight lapse, and evidence of strong\noversight at other companies.\n\nLikewise, we examine the backgrounds of those\nwho serve on key board committees to ensure\nthat they have the required skills and diverse\nbackgrounds to make informed judgments about\nthe subject matter for which the committee is\nresponsible.\n\n10Ken Favaro, Per-OlaKarlsson and Gary L.\nNelson. \u0093The $112 Billion CEO Succession\nProblem.\u0094 ( Strategy+Business, Issue 79,\nSummer 2015).\n\n11Spencer Stuart Board Index, 2019, p. 6.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                   9  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nWe believe shareholders should avoid electing\ndirectors who have a record of not fulfilling\ntheir responsibilities to shareholders at any\ncompany where they have held a board or\nexecutive position. We typically recommend\nvoting against:\n                                              \n      A director who fails to attend a        \n      minimum of 75% of board and applicable  \n      committee meetings,                     \n      calculated in the aggregate.12          \n                                              \n                                              \n      A director who belatedly filed a        \n      significant form(s) 4 or 5, or who has  \n      a pattern of late filings if            \n      the late filing was the director\u0092s       \n      fault (we look at these late filing     \n      situations on a case-by-case basis).    \n                                              \n                                              \n      A director who is also the CEO of a     \n      company where a serious and material    \n      restatement has occurred                \n      after the CEO had previously certified  \n      the pre-restatement financial           \n      statements.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      A director who has received two         \n      against recommendations from Glass      \n      Lewis for identical reasons within      \n      the prior year at different companies   \n      (the same situation must also apply at  \n      the company being analyzed).            \n                                              \nFurthermore, with consideration given to the\ncompany\u0092s overall corporate governance, pay-\nfor-performancealignment and board\nresponsiveness to shareholders, we may\nrecommend voting against directors who served\nthroughout a period in which the company\nperformed significantly worse than peers and\nthe directors have not taken reasonable steps\nto address the poor performance.\n\nBoard Responsiveness\n\nGlass Lewis believes that boards should be\nresponsive to shareholders when a significant\npercentage of shareholders vote contrary to\nthe recommendation of management, depending on\nthe issue.\n\nWhen 20% of more of shareholders vote contrary\nto management (which occurs when more than 20%\nof votes on the proposal are cast as AGAINST\nand/or ABSTAIN), we believe that boards should\nengage with shareholders on the issue and\ndemonstrate some initial level of\nresponsiveness. These include instances when\n20% or more of shareholders:\n                                              \n  (i)    withhold votes from (or vote         \n         against) a director nominee; or      \n                                              \n                                              \n  (ii)    vote against a                      \n          management-sponsored proposal.      \n                                              \nIn our view, a 20% threshold is significant\nenough to warrant a close examination of the\nunderlying issues and an evaluation of whether\nthe board responded appropriately following\nthe vote, particularly in the case of a\ncompensation or director election proposal.\nWhile the 20% threshold alone will not\nautomatically generate a negative vote\nrecommendation from Glass Lewis on a future\nproposal (e.g., to recommend against a\ndirector nominee, against a say-on-\npayproposal, etc.), it may be a contributing\nfactor to our recommendation to vote against\nmanagement\u0092s recommendation in the event we\ndetermine that the board did not respond\nappropriately.\n\nWhen a majority of shareholders vote contrary\nto management, we believe that boards should\nengage with shareholders on the issue and\nprovide a more robust response to fully\naddress shareholder concerns. These include\ninstances when a majority or more of\nshareholders:\n                                              \n  (i)    withhold votes from (or vote         \n         against) a director nominee;         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (ii)    vote against a                      \n          management-sponsored proposal;      \n                                              \nAt controlled companies and companies that\nhave multi-class share structures with unequal\nvoting rights, we will carefully examine the\nlevel of approval or disapproval attributed to\nunaffiliated shareholders when determining\nwhether board responsiveness is warranted. In\nthe case of companies that have multi-class\nshare\n\n12However, where a director has served for\nless than one full year, we will typically not\nrecommend voting against for failure to attend\n75% of meetings. Rather, we will note the poor\nattendance with a recommendation to track this\nissue going forward. We will also refrain from\nrecommending to vote against directors when\nthe proxy discloses that the director missed\nthe meetings due to serious illness or other\nextenuating circumstances.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  10  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nstructures with unequal voting rights, we will\ngenerally examine the level of approval or\ndisapproval attributed to unaffiliated\nshareholders on a \u0093one share, one vote\u0094 basis.\nAt controlled and multi-class companies, when\nat least 20% or more of unaffiliated\nshareholders vote contrary to management, we\nbelieve that boards should engage with\nshareholders and demonstrate some initial\nlevel of responsiveness, and when a majority\nor more of unaffiliated shareholders vote\ncontrary to management, we believe that boards\nshould engage with shareholders and provide a\nmore robust response to address shareholder\nconcerns.\n\nAs a general framework, our evaluation of\nboard responsiveness involves a review of\npublicly available disclosures (e.g., the\nproxy statement, annual report, 8-Ks,company\nwebsite, etc.) released following the date of\nthe company\u0092s last annual meeting up through\nthe publication date of our most current Proxy\nPaper. Depending on the specific issue, our\nfocus typically includes, but is not limited\nto, the following:\n                                              \n      At the board level, any changes in      \n      directorships, committee memberships,   \n      disclosure of related party             \n      transactions, meeting attendance, or    \n      other responsibilities;                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Any revisions made to the company\u0092s      \n      articles of incorporation, bylaws or    \n      other governance                        \n      documents;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      Any press or news releases indicating   \n      changes in, or the adoption of, new     \n      company policies, business              \n      practices or special reports; and       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Any modifications made to the design    \n      and structure of the company\u0092s           \n      compensation program, as                \n      well as an assessment of the company\u0092s   \n      engagement with shareholders on         \n      compensation issues as discussed in     \n      the Compensation Discussion\u00a0& Analysis  \n      (CD&A), particularly following a        \n      material vote against a company\u0092s        \n      say-on-pay.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      Proxy statement disclosure discussing   \n      the board\u0092s efforts to engage with       \n      shareholders and the                    \n      actions taken to address shareholder    \n      concerns.                               \n                                              \nOur Proxy Paper analysis will include a case-\nby-caseassessment of the specific elements of\nboard responsiveness that we examined along\nwith an explanation of how that assessment\nimpacts our current voting recommendations.\n\nBoard Responsiveness to Shareholder Proposals\n\nMajority-Supported Shareholder Proposals\n\nWe expect clear action from the board when\nshareholder proposals receive support from a\nmajority of votes cast (excluding abstentions\nand broker non-votes).In our view, this may\ninclude fully implementing the request of the\nshareholder proposal and/or engaging with\nshareholders on the issue and providing\nsufficient disclosures to address shareholder\nconcerns.\n\nSignificantly Supported Shareholder Proposals\n\nWhen shareholder proposals receive significant\nsupport (generally more than 30% but less than\nmajority of votes cast), we believe an initial\nlevel of board responsiveness is warranted. In\ninstances where a shareholder proposal has\nreceived at least 30% shareholder support, we\ngenerally believe boards should engage with\nshareholders on the issue and provide\ndisclosure addressing shareholder concerns and\noutreach initiatives.\n\nFurther, as discussed above, at controlled\ncompanies and companies that have multi-class\nshare structures with unequal voting rights,\nwe will carefully examine the level of\napproval or disapproval attributed to\nunaffiliated shareholders when determining\nwhether board responsiveness is warranted.\n\nThe Role of a Committee Chair\n\nGlass Lewis believes that a designated\ncommittee chair maintains primary\nresponsibility for the actions of his or her\nrespective committee. As such, many of our\ncommittee-specific voting recommendations are\nagainst the applicable committee chair rather\nthan the entire committee (depending on the\nseriousness of the issue).\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  11  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nIn cases where the committee chair is not up\nfor election due to a staggered board, and\nwhere we have identified multiple concerns, we\nwill generally recommend voting against other\nmembers of the committee who are up for\nelection, on a case-by-casebasis.\n\nIn cases where we would ordinarily recommend\nvoting against a committee chair but the chair\nis not specified, we apply the following\ngeneral rules, which apply throughout our\nguidelines:\n                                              \n      If there is no committee chair, we      \n      recommend voting against the            \n      longest-serving committee member or,    \n      if the longest-serving committee        \n      member cannot be determined, the        \n      longest-serving board member serving    \n      on the committee (i.e., in either       \n      case, the \u0093senior director\u0094); and         \n                                              \n                                              \n      If there is no committee chair, but     \n      multiple senior directors serving on    \n      the committee, we recommend             \n      voting against both (or all) such       \n      senior directors.                       \n                                              \nIn our view, companies should provide clear\ndisclosure of which director is charged with\noverseeing each committee. In cases where that\nsimple framework is ignored and a reasonable\nanalysis cannot determine which committee\nmember is the designated leader, we believe\nshareholder action against the longest serving\ncommittee member(s) is warranted. Again, this\nonly applies if we would ordinarily recommend\nvoting against the committee chair but there\nis either no such position or no designated\ndirector in such role.\n\nAudit Committees and Performance\n\nAudit committees play an integral role in\noverseeing the financial reporting process\nbecause stable capital markets depend on\nreliable, transparent, and objective financial\ninformation to support an efficient and\neffective capital market process. Audit\ncommittees play a vital role in providing this\ndisclosure to shareholders.\n\nWhen assessing an audit committee\u0092s\nperformance, we are aware that an audit\ncommittee does not prepare financial\nstatements, is not responsible for making the\nkey judgments and assumptions that affect the\nfinancial statements, and does not audit the\nnumbers or the disclosures provided to\ninvestors. Rather, an audit committee member\nmonitors and oversees the process and\nprocedures that management and auditors\nperform. The 1999 Report and Recommendations\nof the Blue Ribbon Committee on Improving the\nEffectiveness of Corporate Audit Committees\nstated it best:\n\nA proper and well-functioning system exists,\ntherefore, when the three main groups\nresponsible for financial reporting \u0097 the full\nboard including the audit committee, financial\nmanagement including the internal auditors,\nand the outside auditors \u0097 form a \u0091three\nlegged stool\u0092 that supports responsible\nfinancial disclosure and active participatory\noversight. However, in the view of the\nCommittee, the audit committee must be \u0091first\namong equals\u0092 in this process, since the audit\ncommittee is an extension of the full board\nand hence the ultimate monitor of the process.\n\nStandards for Assessing the Audit Committee\n\nFor an audit committee to function effectively\non investors\u0092 behalf, it must include members\nwith sufficient knowledge to diligently carry\nout their responsibilities. In its audit and\naccounting recommendations, the Conference\nBoard Commission on Public Trust and Private\nEnterprise said \u0093members of the audit\ncommittee must be independent and have both\nknowledge and experience in auditing financial\nmatters.\u0094 13\n\nWe are skeptical of audit committees where\nthere are members that lack expertise as a\nCertified Public Accountant (CPA), Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO) or corporate\ncontroller, or similar experience. While we\nwill not necessarily recommend voting against\nmembers of an audit committee when such\nexpertise is lacking, we are more likely to\nrecommend voting against committee members\nwhen a problem such as a restatement occurs\nand such expertise is lacking.\n\n13Commission on Public Trust and Private\nEnterprise.

The quality and integrity of the\nfinancial statements and earnings reports, the\ncompleteness of disclosures necessary for\ninvestors to make informed decisions, and the\neffectiveness of the internal controls should\nprovide reasonable assurance that the\nfinancial statements are materially free from\nerrors. The independence of the external\nauditors and the results of their work all\nprovide useful information by which to assess\nthe audit committee.\n\nWhen assessing the decisions and actions of\nthe audit committee, we typically defer to its\njudgment and generally recommend voting in\nfavor of its members. However, we will\nconsider recommending that shareholders vote\nagainst the following:\n                                              \n      All members of the audit committee      \n      when options were backdated, there is   \n      a lack of adequate controls             \n      in place, there was a resulting         \n      restatement, and disclosures indicate   \n      there was a lack of documentation with  \n      respect to the option grants.           \n                                              \n                                              \n      The audit committee chair, if the       \n      audit committee does not have a         \n      financial expert or the                 \n      committee\u0092s financial expert does not    \n      have a demonstrable financial           \n      background sufficient to understand     \n      the financial issues unique to public   \n      companies.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      The audit committee chair, if the       \n      audit committee did not meet at least   \n      four times during the year.             \n                                              \n                                              \n      The audit committee chair, if the       \n      committee has less than three members.  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Any audit committee member who sits on  \n      more than three public company audit    \n      committees, unless the                  \n      audit committee member is a retired     \n      CPA, CFO, controller or has similar     \n      experience, in which case the limit     \n      shall be four committees, taking time   \n      and availability into consideration     \n      including a review of the audit         \n      committee member\u0092s attendance            \n      at all board and committee meetings.14  \n                                              \n                                              \n      All members of an audit committee who   \n      are up for election and who served on   \n      the committee at the time               \n      of the audit, if audit and              \n      audit-related fees total one-third or   \n      less of the total fees billed by the    \n      auditor.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      The audit committee chair when tax      \n      and/or other fees are greater than      \n      audit and audit-related fees            \n      paid to the auditor for more than one   \n      year in a row (in which case we also    \n      recommend against ratification of the   \n      auditor).                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      The audit committee chair when fees     \n      paid to the auditor are not disclosed.  \n                                              \n                                              \n      All members of an audit committee       \n      where non-audit fees                    \n      include fees for tax services           \n      (including, but not limited to, such    \n      things as tax avoidance or shelter      \n      schemes) for senior executives of the   \n      company.

We will generally refrain\nfrom recommending against audit committee\nmembers when the restatement in question is\nsolely as a result of the aforementioned SEC\nguidance.\n\n18The Council of Institutional Investors.\n\u0093Corporate Governance Policies,\u0094 p. 4, April\n5, 2006; and \u0093Letter from Council of\nInstitutional Investors to the AICPA,\u0094\nNovember 8, 2006.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  14  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nregistered public accounting firm that audited\nthe company\u0092s financial statements included in\nthe annual report has issued an attestation\nreport on management\u0092s assessment of the\ncompany\u0092s internal control over financial\nreporting.\n\nA material weakness occurs when a company\nidentifies a deficiency, or a combination of\ndeficiencies, in internal controls over\nfinancial reporting, such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of the company\u0092s annual or\ninterim financial statements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis.\nFailure to maintain effective internal\ncontrols can create doubts regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP and may lead to\ncompanies publishing financial statements that\nare not free of errors or misstatements.\n\nWe believe it is the responsibility of audit\ncommittees to ensure that material weaknesses\nare remediated in a timely manner and that\ncompanies disclose remediation plans that\ninclude detailed steps to resolve a given\nmaterial weakness. In cases where a material\nweakness has been ongoing for more than one\nfiscal year, we expect the company to disclose\nan updated remediation plan at least annually\nthereafter. Updates to existing remediation\nplans should state the progress the company\nhas made toward remediating the material\nweakness and the remaining actions the company\nplans to take until the material weakness is\nfully remediated. As such, we are critical of\naudit committees when companies disclose\nremediation plans that remain unchanged from a\nprior period.\n\nWhen a material weakness is reported and the\ncompany has not disclosed a remediation plan,\nor when a material weakness has been ongoing\nfor more than one year and the company has not\ndisclosed an updated remediation plan that\nclearly outlines the company\u0092s progress toward\nremediating the material weakness, we will\nconsider recommending that shareholders vote\nagainst all members of a company\u0092s audit\ncommittee who served on the committee during\nthe time when the material weakness was\nidentified.\n\nWe also take a dim view of audit committee\nreports that are boilerplate, and which\nprovide little or no information or\ntransparency to investors. When a problem such\nas a material weakness, restatement or late\nfilings occurs, in forming our judgment with\nrespect to the audit committee we take into\nconsideration the transparency of the audit\ncommittee report.\n\nCompensation Committee Performance\n\nCompensation committees have a critical role\nin determining the compensation of executives.\nThis includes deciding the basis on which\ncompensation is determined, as well as the\namounts and types of compensation to be paid.\nThis process begins with the hiring and\ninitial establishment of employment\nagreements, including the terms for such items\nas pay, pensions and severance arrangements.\nIt is important in establishing compensation\narrangements that compensation be consistent\nwith, and based on the long-term economic\nperformance of, the business\u0092s long-term\nshareholders returns.\n\nCompensation committees are also responsible\nfor the oversight of the transparency of\ncompensation. This oversight includes\ndisclosure of compensation arrangements, the\nmatrix used in assessing pay for performance,\nand the use of compensation consultants. In\norder to ensure the independence of the\nboard\u0092s compensation consultant, we believe\nthe compensation committee should only engage\na compensation consultant that is not also\nproviding any services to the company or\nmanagement apart from their contract with the\ncompensation committee. It is important to\ninvestors that they have clear and complete\ndisclosure of all the significant terms of\ncompensation arrangements in order to make\ninformed decisions with respect to the\noversight and decisions of the compensation\ncommittee.\n\nFinally, compensation committees are\nresponsible for oversight of internal controls\nover the executive compensation process. This\nincludes controls over gathering information\nused to determine compensation, establishment\nof equity award plans, and granting of equity\nawards. For example, the use of a compensation\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  15  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nconsultant who maintains a business\nrelationship with company management may cause\nthe committee to make decisions based on\ninformation that is compromised by the\nconsultant\u0092s conflict of interests. Lax\ncontrols can also contribute to improper\nawards of compensation such as through\ngranting of backdated or spring-loaded\noptions, or granting of bonuses when triggers\nfor bonus payments have not been met.\n\nCentral to understanding the actions of\ncompensation committee is a careful review of\nthe CD&A report included in each company\u0092s\nproxy. We review the CD&A in our evaluation of\nthe overall compensation practices of a\ncompany, as overseen by the compensation\ncommittee. The CD&A is also integral to the\nevaluation of compensation proposals at\ncompanies, such as advisory votes on executive\ncompensation, which allow shareholders to vote\non the compensation paid to a company\u0092s top\nexecutives.\n\nWhen assessing the performance of compensation\ncommittees, we will consider recommending that\nshareholders vote against the following:\n                                              \n      All members of a compensation           \n      committee during whose tenure the       \n      committee failed to address             \n      shareholder concerns following          \n      majority shareholder rejection of the   \n      say-on-pay proposal in the previous     \n      year.

In performing\nthis role, the committee is responsible and\naccountable for selection of objective and\ncompetent board members. It is also\nresponsible for providing leadership on\ngovernance policies adopted by the company,\nsuch as decisions to implement shareholder\nproposals that have received a majority vote.\nAt most companies, a single committee is\ncharged with these oversight functions; at\nothers, the governance and nominating\nresponsibilities are apportioned among two\nseparate committees.\n\nConsistent with Glass Lewis\u0092 philosophy that\nboards should have diverse backgrounds and\nmembers with a breadth and depth of relevant\nexperience, we believe that nominating and\ngovernance committees should consider\ndiversity when making director nominations\nwithin the context of each specific company\nand its industry. In our view, shareholders\nare best served when boards make an effort to\nensure a constituency that is not only\nreasonably diverse on the basis of age, race,\ngender and ethnicity, but also on the basis of\ngeographic knowledge, industry experience,\nboard tenure and culture.\n\n20In all other instances (i.e., a non-\ncompensation-relatedshareholder proposal\nshould have been implemented) we recommend\nthat shareholders vote against the members of\nthe governance committee.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  17  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nRegarding the committee responsible for\ngovernance, we will consider recommending that\nshareholders vote against the following:\n                                              \n      All members of the governance           \n      committee21 during                      \n      whose tenure a shareholder proposal     \n      relating to important shareholder       \n      rights received support from a          \n      majority of the votes cast (excluding   \n      abstentions and broker non-votes) and   \n      the board has not begun to              \n      implement or enact the proposal\u0092s        \n      subject matter.22 Examples of such      \n      shareholder proposals include those     \n      seeking a declassified board            \n      structure, a majority vote standard     \n      for director                            \n      elections, or a right to call a         \n      special meeting.

Examples of board\nactions that may cause such a recommendation\ninclude: the elimination of the ability of\nshareholders to call a special meeting or to\nact by written consent; an increase to the\nownership threshold required for shareholders\nto call a special meeting; an increase to vote\nrequirements for charter or bylaw amendments;\nthe adoption of provisions that limit the\nability of shareholders to pursue full legal\nrecourse \u0097 such as bylaws that require\narbitration of shareholder claims or that\nrequire shareholder plaintiffs to pay the\ncompany\u0092s legal expenses in the absence of a\ncourt victory (i.e., \u0093fee-shifting\u0094or \u0093loser\npays\u0094 bylaws); the adoption of a classified\nboard structure; and the elimination of the\nability of shareholders to remove a director\nwithout cause.\n\nRegarding the nominating committee, we will\nconsider recommending that shareholders vote\nagainst the following:\n                                              \n      All members of the nominating           \n      committee, when the committee           \n      nominated or renominated an individual  \n      who had a significant conflict of       \n      interest or whose past actions          \n      demonstrated a lack of integrity or     \n      inability to represent shareholder      \n      interests.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      The nominating committee chair, if the  \n      nominating committee did not meet       \n      during the year.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      In the absence of a governance          \n      committee, the nominating committee     \n      chair when the chair is not             \n      independent, and an independent lead    \n      or presiding director has not been      \n      appointed.                              \n                                              \n24A forum selection clause is a bylaw\nprovision stipulating that a certain state or\nfederal jurisdiction is the exclusive forum\nfor specified legal matters.

Sound risk\nmanagement, while necessary at all companies,\nis particularly important at financial firms\nwhich inherently maintain significant exposure\nto financial risk. We believe such financial\nfirms should have a chief risk officer\nreporting directly to the board and a\ndedicated risk committee or a committee of the\nboard charged with risk oversight. Moreover,\nmany non-financialfirms maintain strategies\nwhich involve a high level of exposure to\nfinancial risk. Similarly, since many non-\nfinancialfirms have complex hedging or trading\nstrategies, those firms should also have a\nchief risk officer and a risk committee.\n\nOur views on risk oversight are consistent\nwith those expressed by various regulatory\nbodies. In its December 2009 Final Rule\nrelease on Proxy Disclosure Enhancements, the\nSEC noted that risk oversight is a key\ncompetence of the board and that additional\ndisclosures would improve investor and\nshareholder understanding of the role of the\nboard in the organization\u0092s risk management\npractices. The final rules, which became\neffective on February 28, 2010, now explicitly\nrequire companies and mutual funds to describe\n(while allowing for some degree of\nflexibility) the board\u0092s role in the oversight\nof risk.\n\nWhen analyzing the risk management practices\nof public companies, we take note of any\nsignificant losses or writedowns on financial\nassets and/or structured transactions. In\ncases where a company has disclosed a sizable\nloss or writedown, and where we find that the\ncompany\u0092s board-level risk committee\u0092s poor\noversight\n\n26Considering that shareholder disapproval\nclearly relates to the director who received a\ngreater than 50% against vote rather than the\nnominating chair, we review the severity of\nthe issue(s) that initially raised shareholder\nconcern as well as company responsiveness to\nsuch matters, and will only recommend voting\nagainst the nominating chair if a reasonable\nanalysis suggests that it would be most\nappropriate. In rare cases, we will consider\nrecommending against the nominating chair when\na director receives a substantial (i.e., 20%\nor more) vote against based on the same\nanalysis.\n\n27Women and directors that identify with a\ngender other than male or female.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  20  \n  States                                      \n                                              \ncontributed to the loss, we will recommend\nthat shareholders vote against such committee\nmembers on that basis. In addition, in cases\nwhere a company maintains a significant level\nof financial risk exposure but fails to\ndisclose any explicit form of board-level risk\noversight (committee or otherwise), 28we will\nconsider recommending to vote against the\nboard chair on that basis. However, we\ngenerally would not recommend voting against a\ncombined chair/CEO, except in egregious cases.\n\nBoard Oversight of Environmental and Social\nIssues\n\nGlass Lewis recognizes the importance of\nensuring the sustainability of companies\u0092\noperations. We believe that insufficient\noversight of material environmental and social\nissues can present direct legal, financial,\nregulatory and reputational risks that could\nserve to harm shareholder interests.\nTherefore, we believe that these issues should\nbe carefully monitored and managed by\ncompanies, and that all companies should have\nan appropriate oversight structure in place to\nensure that they are mitigating attendant\nrisks and capitalizing on related\nopportunities to the best extent possible.\n\nTo that end, Glass Lewis believes that\ncompanies should ensure that boards maintain\nclear oversight of material risks to their\noperations, including those that are\nenvironmental and social in nature. These\nrisks could include, but are not limited to,\nmatters related to climate change, human\ncapital management, diversity, stakeholder\nrelations, and health, safety & environment.\nGiven the importance of the board\u0092s role in\noverseeing environmental and social risks, we\nbelieve this responsibility should be formally\ndesignated and codified in the appropriate\ncommittee charters or other governing\ndocuments.\n\nWhile we believe that it is important that\nthese issues are overseen at the board level\nand that shareholders are afforded meaningful\ndisclosure of these oversight\nresponsibilities, we believe that companies\nshould determine the best structure for this\noversight. In our view, this oversight can be\neffectively conducted by specific directors,\nthe entire board, a separate committee, or\ncombined with the responsibilities of a key\ncommittee.\n\nFor companies in the Russell 3000 index and in\ninstances where we identify material oversight\nconcerns, Glass Lewis will review a company\u0092s\noverall governance practices and identify\nwhich directors or board-level committees have\nbeen charged with oversight of environmental\nand/or social issues. Furthermore, given the\nimportance of the board\u0092s role in overseeing\nenvironmental and social risks, Glass Lewis\nwill generally recommend voting against the\ngovernance committee chair of a company in the\nRussell 1000 index that fails to provide\nexplicit disclosure concerning the board\u0092s\nrole in overseeing these issues.\n\nWhen evaluating the board\u0092s role in overseeing\nenvironmental and/or social issues, we will\nexamine a company\u0092s committee charters and\ngoverning documents to determine if the\ncompany has codified and maintained a\nmeaningful level of oversight of and\naccountability for a company\u0092s material\nenvironmental and social impacts.\n\nBoard Oversight of Technology\n\nCyber Risk Oversight\n\nCompanies and consumers are exposed to a\ngrowing risk of cyber-attacks. These attacks\ncan result in customer or employee data\nbreaches, harm to a company\u0092s reputation,\nsignificant fines or penalties, and\ninterruption to a company\u0092s operations.\nFurther, in some instances, cyber breaches can\nresult in national security concerns, such as\nthose impacting companies operating as\nutilities, defense contractors, and energy\ncompanies.\n\n28A committee responsible for risk management\ncould be a dedicated risk committee, the audit\ncommittee, or the finance committee, depending\non a given company\u0092s board structure and\nmethod of disclosure. At some companies, the\nentire board is charged with risk management.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  21  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nIn response to these issues, regulators have\nincreasingly been focused on ensuring\ncompanies are providing appropriate and timely\ndisclosures and protections to stakeholders\nthat could have been adversely impacted by a\nbreach in a company\u0092s cyber infrastructure.\n\nOn July 26, 2023, the SEC approved final rules\nrequiring public companies to report\ncybersecurity incidents deemed material within\nfour days of identifying them, detailing their\nnature, scope, timing, and material impact\nunder Item 1.05 on Form 8-K.\n\nFurthermore, in annual reports, companies must\ndisclose their processes for assessing,\nidentifying, and managing material\ncybersecurity risks, along with their material\neffects; and describe whether any risks from\nprior incidents have materially affected its\nbusiness strategy, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition (or are reasonably likely\nto), pursuant to Regulation S-KItem 106. Item\n106 will also require registrants to describe\nthe board of directors\u0092 oversight of risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats and management\u0092s\nrole and expertise in assessing and managing\nmaterial risks from cybersecurity threats.\nSimilar rules were also adopted for foreign\nprivate issuers. The final rules became\neffective on September 5, 2023.\n\nGiven the regulatory focus on, and the\npotential adverse outcomes from, cyber-related\nissues, it is our view that cyber risk is\nmaterial for all companies. We therefore\nbelieve that it is critical that companies\nevaluate and mitigate these risks to the\ngreatest extent possible. With that view, we\nencourage all issuers to provide clear\ndisclosure concerning the role of the board in\noverseeing issues related to cybersecurity,\nincluding how companies are ensuring directors\nare fully versed on this rapidly evolving and\ndynamic issue. We believe such disclosure can\nhelp shareholders understand the seriousness\nwith which companies take this issue.\n\nIn the absence of material cyber incidents, we\nwill generally not make voting recommendations\non the basis of a company\u0092s oversight or\ndisclosure concerning cyber-related issues.\nHowever, in instances where cyber-attacks have\ncaused significant harm to shareholders we\nwill closely evaluate the board\u0092s oversight of\ncybersecurity as well as the company\u0092s\nresponse and disclosures.\n\nMoreover, in instances where a company has\nbeen materially impacted by a cyber-attack, we\nbelieve shareholders can reasonably expect\nperiodic updates communicating the company\u0092s\nongoing progress towards resolving and\nremediating the impact of the cyber-attack. We\ngenerally believe shareholders are best served\nwhen such updates include (but are not\nnecessarily limited to) details such as when\nthe company has fully restored its information\nsystems, when the company has returned to\nnormal operations, what resources the company\nis providing for affected stakeholders, and\nany other potentially relevant information,\nuntil the company considers the impact of the\ncyber-attack to be fully remediated. These\ndisclosures should focus on the company\u0092s\nresponse to address the impacts to affected\nstakeholders and should not reveal specific\nand/or technical details that could impede the\ncompany\u0092s response or remediation of the\nincident or that could assist threat actors.\n\nIn such instances, we may recommend against\nappropriate directors should we find the\nboard\u0092s oversight, response or disclosure\nconcerning cybersecurity-related issues to be\ninsufficient, or are not provided to\nshareholders.\n\nBoard Oversight of Artificial Intelligence\n\nIn recent years, companies have rapidly begun\nto develop and adopt uses for artificial\nintelligence (AI) technologies throughout\nvarious aspects of their operations. Deployed\nand overseen effectively, AI technologies have\nthe potential to make companies\u0092 operations\nand systems more efficient and productive.\nHowever, as the use of these technologies has\ngrown, so have the potential risks associated\nwith companies\u0092 development and use of AI.\nGiven these potential risks, we believe that\nboards should be cognizant of, and take steps\nto mitigate exposure to, any material risks\nthat could arise from their use or development\nof AI.\n\nCompanies that use or develop AI technologies\nshould consider adopting strong internal\nframeworks that include ethical considerations\nand ensure they have provided a sufficient\nlevel of oversight of AI. As such,\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  22  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nboards may seek to ensure effective oversight\nand address skills gaps by engaging in\ncontinued board education and/or appointing\ndirectors with AI expertise. With that view,\nwe believe that all companies that develop or\nemploy the use of AI in their operations\nshould provide clear disclosure concerning the\nrole of the board in overseeing issues related\nto AI, including how companies are ensuring\ndirectors are fully versed on this rapidly\nevolving and dynamic issue. We believe such\ndisclosure can help shareholders understand\nthe seriousness with which companies take this\nissue.\n\nWhile we believe that it is important that\nthese issues are overseen at the board level\nand that shareholders are afforded meaningful\ndisclosure of these oversight\nresponsibilities, we believe that companies\nshould determine the best structure for this\noversight. In our view, this oversight can be\neffectively conducted by specific directors,\nthe entire board, a separate committee, or\ncombined with the responsibilities of a key\ncommittee.\n\nIn the absence of material incidents related\nto a company\u0092s use or management of AI-\nrelatedissues, we will generally not make\nvoting recommendations on the basis of a\ncompany\u0092s oversight of, or disclosure\nconcerning, AI-relatedissues. However, in\ninstances where there is evidence that\ninsufficient oversight and/or management of AI\ntechnologies has resulted in material harm to\nshareholders, Glass Lewis will review a\ncompany\u0092s overall governance practices and\nidentify which directors or board-level\ncommittees have been charged with oversight of\nAI-relatedrisks. We will also closely evaluate\nthe board\u0092s response to, and management of,\nthis issue as well as any associated\ndisclosures and may recommend against\nappropriate directors should we find the\nboard\u0092s oversight, response or disclosure\nconcerning AI-relatedissues to be\ninsufficient.\n\nBoard Accountability for Environmental and\nSocial Performance\n\nGlass Lewis carefully monitors companies\u0092\nperformance with respect to environmental and\nsocial issues, including those related to\nclimate and human capital management. In\nsituations where we believe that a company has\nnot properly managed or mitigated material\nenvironmental or social risks to the detriment\nof shareholder value, or when such\nmismanagement has threatened shareholder\nvalue, Glass Lewis may recommend that\nshareholders vote against the members of the\nboard who are responsible for oversight of\nenvironmental and social risks. In the absence\nof explicit board oversight of environmental\nand social issues, Glass Lewis may recommend\nthat shareholders vote against members of the\naudit committee. In making these\ndeterminations, Glass Lewis will carefully\nreview the situation, its effect on\nshareholder value, as well as any corrective\naction or other response made by the company.\n\nFor more information on how Glass Lewis\nevaluates environmental and social issues,\nplease see Glass Lewis\u0092 Overall Approach to\nESG as well as our comprehensive Proxy Paper\nGuidelines for Shareholder Proposals & ESG-\nRelatedIssues, available\natwww.glasslewis.com/voting-policies-current/.\n\nBoard Accountability for Climate-related\nIssues\n\nGiven the exceptionally broad impacts of a\nchanging climate on companies, the economy,\nand society in general, we view climate risk\nas a material risk for all companies. We\ntherefore believe that boards should be\nconsidering and evaluating their operational\nresilience under lower-carbon scenarios. While\nall companies maintain exposure to climate-\nrelated risks, we believe that additional\nconsideration should be given to, and that\ndisclosure should be provided by those\ncompanies whose GHG emissions represent a\nfinancially material risk.\n\nWe believe that companies with this increased\nrisk exposure should provide clear and\ncomprehensive disclosure regarding these\nrisks, including how they are being mitigated\nand overseen. We believe such information is\ncrucial to allow investors to understand the\ncompany\u0092s management of this issue, as well as\nthe impact of a lower carbon future on the\ncompany\u0092s operations.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  23  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nIn line with this view, Glass Lewis will\ncarefully examine the climate-related\ndisclosures provided by companies in the S&P\n500 index with material exposure to climate\nrisk stemming from their own operations 29, as\nwell as companies where we believe emissions\nor climate impacts, or stakeholder scrutiny\nthereof, represent an outsized, financially\nmaterial risk, in order to assess whether they\nhave produced disclosures in line with the\nrecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) or IFRS\nS2 Climate-related Disclosures. We will also\nassess whether these companies have disclosed\nexplicit and clearly defined board-level\noversight responsibilities for climate-related\nissues. In instances where we find either (or\nboth) of these disclosures to be absent or\nsignificantly lacking, we may recommend voting\nagainst the chair of the committee (or board)\ncharged with oversight of climate-related\nissues, or if no committee has been charged\nwith such oversight, the chair of the\ngovernance committee. Further, we may extend\nour recommendation on this basis to additional\nmembers of the responsible committee in cases\nwhere the committee chair is not standing for\nelection due to a classified board, or based\non other factors, including the company\u0092s\nsize, industry and its overall governance\nprofile.\n\nDirector Commitments\n\nWe believe that directors should have the\nnecessary time to fulfill their duties to\nshareholders. In our view, an overcommitted\ndirector can pose a material risk to a\ncompany\u0092s shareholders, particularly during\nperiods of crisis. In addition, recent\nresearch indicates that the time commitment\nassociated with being a director has been on a\nsignificant upward trend in the past decade.\n30As a result, we generally recommend that\nshareholders vote against a director who\nserves as an executive officer (other than\nexecutive chair) of any public company 31while\nserving on more than one external public\ncompany board, a director who serves as an\nexecutive chair of any public company while\nserving on more than two external public\ncompany boards, and any other director who\nserves on more than five public company\nboards.\n\nBecause we believe that executives will\nprimarily devote their attention to executive\nduties, we generally will not recommend that\nshareholders vote against overcommitted\ndirectors at the companies where they serve as\nan executive.\n\nWhen determining whether a director\u0092s service\non an excessive number of boards may limit the\nability of the director to devote sufficient\ntime to board duties, we may consider relevant\nfactors such as the size and location of the\nother companies where the director serves on\nthe board, the director\u0092s board roles at the\ncompanies in question, whether the director\nserves on the board of any large privately-\nheld companies, the director\u0092s tenure on the\nboards in question, and the director\u0092s\nattendance record at all companies. In the\ncase of directors who serve in executive roles\nother than CEO (e.g., executive chair), we\nwill evaluate the specific duties and\nresponsibilities of that role in determining\nwhether an exception is warranted.\n\nWe may also refrain from recommending against\ncertain directors if the company provides\nsufficient rationale for their continued board\nservice. The rationale should allow\nshareholders to evaluate the scope of the\n\n29This policy will generally apply to\ncompanies in the following SASB-defined\nindustries: agricultural products, air freight\n& logistics, airlines, chemicals, construction\nmaterials, containers & packaging, cruise\nlines, electric utilities & power generators,\nfood retailers & distributors, health care\ndistributors, iron & steel producers, marine\ntransportation, meat, poultry & dairy, metals\n& mining, non-alcoholicbeverages, oil & gas,\npulp & paper products, rail transportation,\nroad transportation, semiconductors, waste\nmanagement.\n\n30For example, the 2015-2016 NACD Public\nCompany Governance Survey states that, on\naverage, directors spent a total of 248.2\nhours annual on board-related matters during\nthe past year, which it describes as a\n\u0093historically high level\u0094 that is\nsignificantly above the average hours recorded\nin 2006. Additionally, the 2020 Spencer Stuart\nBoard Index indicates that, while 39% of S&P\n500 CEOs serve on one additional public board,\njust 2% of S&P 500 CEOs serve on two\nadditional public boards and only one CEO\nserves on three.\n\n31When the executive officer in question\nserves only as an executive at a special\npurpose acquisition company (SPAC) we will\ngenerally apply the higher threshold of five\npublic company directorships.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  24  \n  States                                      \n                                              \ndirectors\u0092 other commitments, as well as their\ncontributions to the board including\nspecialized knowledge of the company\u0092s\nindustry, strategy or key markets, the\ndiversity of skills, perspective and\nbackground they provide, and other relevant\nfactors. We will also generally refrain from\nrecommending to vote against a director who\nserves on an excessive number of boards within\na consolidated group of companies in related\nindustries, or a director that represents a\nfirm whose sole purpose is to manage a\nportfolio of investments which include the\ncompany.\n\nOther Considerations\n\nIn addition to the three key characteristics \u0097\nindependence, performance, experience \u0097 that\nwe use to evaluate board members, we consider\nconflict-of-interestissues as well as the size\nof the board of directors when making voting\nrecommendations.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nWe believe board members should be wholly free\nof identifiable and substantial conflicts of\ninterest, regardless of the overall level of\nindependent directors on the board.\nAccordingly, we recommend that shareholders\nvote against the following types of directors:\n                                              \n      A CFO who is on the board: In our       \n      view, the CFO holds a unique position   \n      relative to financial                   \n      reporting and disclosure to             \n      shareholders. Due to the critical       \n      importance of financial disclosure and  \n      reporting, we believe the CFO should    \n      report to the board and not be a        \n      member of it.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      A director who provides \u0097 or a director  \n      who has an immediate family member who  \n      provides \u0097                               \n      material consulting or other material   \n      professional services to the company.   \n      These services may include legal,       \n      consulting,32 or financial services.    \n      We question the need for the company    \n      to have                                 \n      consulting relationships with its       \n      directors. We view such relationships   \n      as creating conflicts for directors,    \n      since they may be forced to weigh       \n      their own interests against             \n      shareholder interests when making       \n      board decisions. In addition, a         \n      company\u0092s decisions regarding where to   \n      turn for the best professional          \n      services may be compromised when doing  \n      business with the professional          \n      services firm of one of the company\u0092s    \n      directors.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      A director, or a director who has an    \n      immediate family member, engaging in    \n      airplane, real estate, or               \n      similar deals, including                \n      perquisite-type grants from the         \n      company, amounting to more than         \n      $50,000. Directors who receive these    \n      sorts of payments from the company      \n      will have to make unnecessarily         \n      complicated decisions that may pit      \n      their interests                         \n      against shareholder interests.          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Interlocking directorships: CEOs or     \n      other top executives who serve on each  \n      other\u0092s boards create                    \n      an interlock that poses conflicts that  \n      should be avoided to ensure the         \n      promotion of shareholder interests      \n      above all else.33                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      All board members who served at a time  \n      when a poison pill with a term of       \n      longer than one year was                \n      adopted without shareholder approval    \n      within the prior twelve months.34 In    \n      the event a board is classified and     \n      shareholders are therefore unable to    \n      vote against all directors, we will     \n      recommend                               \n      voting against the remaining directors  \n      the next year they are up for a         \n      shareholder vote. If a poison pill      \n                                              \n32We will generally refrain from recommending\nagainst a director who provides consulting\nservices for the company if the director is\nexcluded from membership on the board\u0092s key\ncommittees and we have not identified\nsignificant governance concerns with the\nboard.\n\n33We do not apply a look-back period for this\nsituation. The interlock policy applies to\nboth public and private companies. On a case-\nby-casebasis, we evaluate other types of\ninterlocking relationships, such as interlocks\nwith close family members of executives or\nwithin group companies. Further, we will also\nevaluate multiple board interlocks among non-\ninsiders(i.e., multiple directors serving on\nthe same boards at other companies), for\nevidence of a pattern of poor oversight.\n\n34Refer to the \u0093Governance Structure and the\nShareholder Franchise\u0094 section for further\ndiscussion of our policies regarding anti-\ntakeover measures, including poison pills.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  25  \n  States                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  with a term of one year or less was         \n  adopted without shareholder approval, and   \n  without adequate justification, we will     \n  consider recommending that shareholders     \n  vote against all members of the             \n  governance committee. If the board has,     \n  without seeking shareholder approval, and   \n  without adequate justification, extended    \n  the term of a poison pill by one year or    \n  less in two consecutive years, we will      \n  consider recommending that shareholders     \n  vote                                        \n  against the entire board.                   \n                                              \nSize of the Board of Directors\n\nWhile we do not believe there is a universally\napplicable optimal board size, we do believe\nboards should have at least five directors to\nensure sufficient diversity in decision-making\nand to enable the formation of key board\ncommittees with independent directors.\nConversely, we believe that boards with more\nthan 20 members will typically suffer under\nthe weight of \u0093too many cooks in the kitchen\u0094\nand have difficulty reaching consensus and\nmaking timely decisions. Sometimes the\npresence of too many voices can make it\ndifficult to draw on the wisdom and experience\nin the room by virtue of the need to limit the\ndiscussion so that each voice may be heard.\n\nTo that end, we typically recommend voting\nagainst the chair of the nominating committee\n(or the governance committee, in the absence\nof a nominating committee) at a board with\nfewer than five directors or more than 20\ndirectors.\n\nControlled Companies\n\nWe believe controlled companies warrant\ncertain exceptions to our independence\nstandards. The board\u0092s function is to protect\nshareholder interests; however, when an\nindividual, entity (or group of shareholders\nparty to a formal agreement) owns more than\n50% of the voting shares, the interests of the\nmajority of shareholders are the interests of\nthat entity or individual. Consequently, Glass\nLewis does not apply our usual two-thirdsboard\nindependence rule and therefore we will not\nrecommend voting against boards whose\ncomposition reflects the makeup of the\nshareholder population.\n\nIndependence Exceptions\n\nThe independence exceptions that we make for\ncontrolled companies are as follows:\n                                              \n      We do not require that controlled       \n      companies have boards that are at       \n      least two-thirds independent. So long   \n      as the insiders and/or affiliates are   \n      connected with the controlling entity,  \n      we accept the presence of               \n      non-independent board members.          \n                                              \n                                              \n      The compensation committee and          \n      nominating and governance committees    \n      do not need to consist solely of        \n      independent directors.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       We believe that standing nominating    \n       and corporate governance committees    \n       at controlled companies are            \n       unnecessary. Although having a         \n       committee charged with the duties of   \n  \u25cb    searching for, selecting, and          \n       nominating independent directors can   \n       be beneficial, the unique composition  \n       of a controlled company\u0092s shareholder   \n       base makes such committees weak        \n       and irrelevant.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Likewise, we believe that independent  \n       compensation committees at controlled  \n       companies are                          \n       unnecessary. Although independent      \n       directors are the best choice for      \n       approving and monitoring senior        \n       executives\u0092 pay, controlled companies   \n       serve a unique shareholder population  \n       whose voting power ensures the         \n       protection of its interests. As such,  \n  \u25cb    we believe that having affiliated      \n       directors on a controlled company\u0092s     \n       compensation committee is acceptable.  \n       However, given that a controlled       \n       company has certain obligations to     \n       minority shareholders we feel that an  \n       insider should not serve on            \n       the compensation committee.            \n       Therefore, Glass Lewis will recommend  \n       voting against any insider (the CEO    \n       or otherwise) serving on the           \n       compensation committee.                \n                                              \n                                              \n      Controlled companies do not need an     \n      independent chair or an independent     \n      lead or presiding director.             \n      Although an independent director in a   \n      position of authority on the board \u0097     \n      such as chair or presiding director \u0097    \n      can best carry out the board\u0092s duties,   \n      controlled companies serve a unique     \n      shareholder population whose voting     \n      power                                   \n      ensures the protection of its           \n      interests.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  26  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nSize of the Board of Directors\n\nWe have no board size requirements for\ncontrolled companies.\n\nAudit Committee Independence\n\nDespite a controlled company\u0092s status, unlike\nfor the other key committees, we nevertheless\nbelieve that audit committees should consist\nsolely of independent directors. Regardless of\na company\u0092s controlled status, the interests\nof all shareholders must be protected by\nensuring the integrity and accuracy of the\ncompany\u0092s financial statements. Allowing\naffiliated directors to oversee the\npreparation of financial reports could create\nan insurmountable conflict of interest.\n\nBoard Responsiveness at Multi-Class Companies\n\nAt controlled companies and companies that\nhave multi-class share structures with unequal\nvoting rights, we will carefully examine the\nlevel of approval or disapproval attributed to\nunaffiliated shareholders when determining\nwhether board responsiveness is warranted. In\nthe case of companies that have multi-class\nshare structures with unequal voting rights,\nwe will generally examine the level of\napproval or disapproval attributed to\nunaffiliated shareholders on a \u0093one share, one\nvote\u0094 basis. At controlled and multi-class\ncompanies, when at least 20% or more of\nunaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to\nmanagement, we believe that boards should\nengage with shareholders and demonstrate some\ninitial level of responsiveness, and when a\nmajority or more of unaffiliated shareholders\nvote contrary to management we believe that\nboards should engage with shareholders and\nprovide a more robust response to fully\naddress shareholder concerns.\n\nSignificant Shareholders\n\nWhere an individual or entity holds between\n20-50%of a company\u0092s voting power, we believe\nit is reasonable to allow proportional\nrepresentation on the board and committees\n(excluding the audit committee) based on the\nindividual or entity\u0092s percentage of\nownership.\n\nGovernance Following an IPO, Spin-Off,or\nDirect Listing\n\nWe believe companies that have recently\ncompleted an initial public offering (IPO),\nspin-off,or direct listing should be allowed\nadequate time to fully comply with marketplace\nlisting requirements and meet basic corporate\ngovernance standards. Generally speaking, we\nrefrain from making recommendations on the\nbasis of governance standards (e.g., board\nindependence, committee membership and\nstructure, meeting attendance, etc.) during\nthe one-yearperiod following an IPO.\n\nHowever, some cases warrant shareholder action\nagainst the board of a company that have\ncompleted an IPO, spin-off,or direct listing\nwithin the past year. When evaluating\ncompanies that have recently gone public,\nGlass Lewis will review the terms of the\napplicable governing documents in order to\ndetermine whether shareholder rights are being\nseverely restricted indefinitely. We believe\nboards that approve highly restrictive\ngoverning documents have demonstrated that\nthey may subvert shareholder interests\nfollowing the IPO. In conducting this\nevaluation, Glass Lewis will consider:\n                                              \n      The adoption of anti-takeover           \n      provisions such as a poison pill or     \n      classified board                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      Supermajority vote requirements to      \n      amend governing documents               \n                                              \n                                              \n      The presence of exclusive forum or      \n      fee-shifting provisions                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Whether shareholders can call special   \n      meetings or act by written consent      \n                                              \n                                              \n      The voting standard provided for the    \n      election of directors                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      The ability of shareholders to remove   \n      directors without cause                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      The presence of evergreen provisions    \n      in the company\u0092s equity compensation     \n      arrangements                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      The presence of a multi-class share     \n      structure which does not afford common  \n      shareholders voting power               \n      that is aligned with their economic     \n      interest                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  27  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nIn cases where Glass Lewis determines that the\nboard has approved overly restrictive\ngoverning documents, we will generally\nrecommend voting against members of the\ngovernance committee. If there is no\ngovernance committee, or if a portion of such\ncommittee members are not standing for\nelection due to a classified board structure,\nwe will expand our recommendations to\nadditional director nominees, based on who is\nstanding for election.\n\nIn cases where, preceding an IPO, the board\nadopts a multi-class share structure where\nvoting rights are not aligned with economic\ninterest, or an anti-takeover provision, such\nas a poison pill or classified board, we will\ngenerally recommend voting against all members\nof the board who served at the time of the IPO\nif the board: (i) did not also commit to\nsubmitting these provisions to a shareholder\nvote at the company\u0092s first shareholder\nmeeting following the IPO; or (ii) did not\nprovide for a reasonable sunset of these\nprovisions (generally three to five years in\nthe case of a classified board or poison pill;\nor seven years or less in the case of a multi-\nclass share structure). In the case of a\nmulti-class share structure, if these\nprovisions are put to a shareholder vote, we\nwill examine the level of approval or\ndisapproval attributed to unaffiliated\nshareholders when determining the vote\noutcome.\n\nIn our view, adopting an anti-takeover device\nunfairly penalizes future shareholders who\n(except for electing to buy or sell the stock)\nare unable to weigh in on a matter that could\npotentially negatively impact their ownership\ninterest. This notion is strengthened when a\nboard adopts a classified board with an\ninfinite duration or a poison pill with a\nfive- to ten-yearterm immediately prior to\ngoing public, thereby insulating management\nfor a substantial amount of time.\n\nIn addition, shareholders should also be wary\nof companies that adopt supermajority voting\nrequirements before their IPO. Absent explicit\nprovisions in the articles or bylaws\nstipulating that certain policies will be\nphased out over a certain period of time,\nlong-term shareholders could find themselves\nin the predicament of having to attain a\nsupermajority vote to approve future proposals\nseeking to eliminate such policies.\n\nGovernance Following a Business Combination\nwith a Special Purpose Acquisition Company\n\nThe business combination of a private company\nwith a publicly traded special purpose\nacquisition company (SPAC) facilitates the\nprivate entity becoming a publicly traded\ncorporation. Thus, the business combination\nrepresents the private company\u0092s de-factoIPO.\nWe believe that some cases warrant shareholder\naction against the board of a company that\nhave completed a business combination with a\nSPAC within the past year.\n\nAt meetings where shareholders vote on the\nbusiness combination of a SPAC with a private\ncompany, shareholders are generally voting on\na new corporate charter for the post-\ncombination company as a condition to approval\nof the business combination. In many cases,\nshareholders are faced with the dilemma of\nhaving to approve corporate charters that\nseverely restrict shareholder rights to\nfacilitate the business combination.\nTherefore, when shareholders are required to\napprove binding charters as a condition to\napproval of a business combination with a\nSPAC, we believe shareholders should also be\nprovided with advisory votes on material\ncharter amendments as a means to voice their\nopinions on such restrictive governance\nprovisions.\n\nWhen evaluating companies that have recently\ngone public via business combination with a\nSPAC, Glass Lewis will review the terms of the\napplicable governing documents to determine\nwhether shareholder rights are being severely\nrestricted indefinitely and whether these\nrestrictive provisions were put forth for a\nshareholder vote on an advisory basis at the\nprior meeting where shareholders voted on the\nbusiness combination.\n\nIn cases where, prior to the combined company\nbecoming publicly traded, the board adopts a\nmulti-class share structure where voting\nrights are not aligned with economic interest,\nor an anti-takeover provision, such as a\npoison pill or classified board, we will\ngenerally recommend voting against all members\nof the board who served at the time of the\ncombined company becoming publicly traded if\nthe board: (i) did not also submit these\nprovisions to a shareholder vote on an\nadvisory basis at the prior meeting where\nshareholders voted on\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  28  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nthe business combination; (ii) did not also\ncommit to submitting these provisions to a\nshareholder vote at the company\u0092s first\nshareholder meeting following the company\nbecoming publicly traded; or (iii) did not\nprovide for a reasonable sunset of these\nprovisions (generally three to five years in\nthe case of a classified board or poison pill;\nor seven years or less in the case of a multi-\nclass share structure).\n\nConsistent with our view on IPOs, adopting an\nanti-takeover device unfairly penalizes future\nshareholders who (except for electing to buy\nor sell the stock) are unable to weigh in on a\nmatter that could potentially negatively\nimpact their ownership interest.\n\nDual-Listed or Foreign-Incorporated Companies\n\nFor companies that trade on multiple exchanges\nor are incorporated in foreign jurisdictions\nbut trade only in the U.S., we will apply the\ngovernance standard most relevant in each\nsituation. We will consider a number of\nfactors in determining which Glass Lewis\ncountry-specific policy to apply, including\nbut not limited to: (i) the corporate\ngovernance structure and features of the\ncompany including whether the board structure\nis unique to a particular market; (ii) the\nnature of the proposals; (iii) the location of\nthe company\u0092s primary listing, if one can be\ndetermined; (iv) the regulatory/governance\nregime that the board is reporting against;\nand (v) the availability and completeness of\nthe company\u0092s SEC filings.\n\nOTC-listedCompanies\n\nCompanies trading on the OTC Bulletin Board\nare not considered \u0093listed companies\u0094 under\nSEC rules and therefore not subject to the\nsame governance standards as listed companies.\nHowever, we believe that more stringent\ncorporate governance standards should be\napplied to these companies given that their\nshares are still publicly traded.\n\nWhen reviewing OTC companies, Glass Lewis will\nreview the available disclosure relating to\nthe shareholder meeting to determine whether\nshareholders are able to evaluate several key\npieces of information, including: (i) the\ncomposition of the board\u0092s key committees, if\nany; (ii) the level of share ownership of\ncompany insiders or directors; (iii) the board\nmeeting attendance record of directors; (iv)\nexecutive and non-employeedirector\ncompensation; (v) related-party transactions\nconducted during the past year; and (vi) the\nboard\u0092s leadership structure and\ndeterminations regarding director\nindependence.\n\nWe are particularly concerned when company\ndisclosure lacks any information regarding the\nboard\u0092s key committees. We believe that\ncommittees of the board are an essential tool\nfor clarifying how the responsibilities of the\nboard are being delegated, and specifically\nfor indicating which directors are accountable\nfor ensuring: (i) the independence and quality\nof directors, and the transparency and\nintegrity of the nominating process; (ii)\ncompensation programs that are fair and\nappropriate; (iii) proper oversight of the\ncompany\u0092s accounting, financial reporting, and\ninternal and external audits; and (iv) general\nadherence to principles of good corporate\ngovernance.\n\nIn cases where shareholders are unable to\nidentify which board members are responsible\nfor ensuring oversight of the above-mentioned\nresponsibilities, we may consider recommending\nagainst certain members of the board.\nOrdinarily, we believe it is the\nresponsibility of the corporate governance\ncommittee to provide thorough disclosure of\nthe board\u0092s governance practices. In the\nabsence of such a committee, we believe it is\nappropriate to hold the board\u0092s chair or, if\nsuch individual is an executive of the\ncompany, the longest-serving non-\nexecutiveboard member accountable.\n\nMutual Fund Boards\n\nMutual funds, or investment companies, are\nstructured differently from regular public\ncompanies (i.e., operating companies).\nTypically, members of a fund\u0092s advisor are on\nthe board and management takes on a\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  29  \n  States                                      \n                                              \ndifferent role from that of regular public\ncompanies. Thus, we focus on a short list of\nrequirements, although many of our guidelines\nremain the same.\n\nThe following mutual fund policies are similar\nto the policies for regular public companies:\n                                              \n      Size of the board of directors \u0097 The     \n      board should be made up of between      \n      five and twenty                         \n      directors.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      The CFO on the board \u0097 Neither the CFO   \n      of the fund nor the CFO of the fund\u0092s    \n      registered investment advisor should    \n      serve on the board.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      Independence of the audit committee \u0097    \n      The audit committee should consist      \n      solely of                               \n      independent directors.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Audit committee financial expert \u0097 At    \n      least one member of the audit           \n      committee should be                     \n      designated as the audit committee       \n      financial expert.                       \n                                              \nThe following differences from regular public\ncompanies apply at mutual funds:\n                                              \n      Independence of the board \u0097 We believe   \n      that three-fourths of an investment     \n      company\u0092s                                \n      board should be made up of independent  \n      directors. This is consistent with a    \n      proposed SEC rule on investment         \n      company boards. The Investment Company  \n      Act requires 40% of the board to be     \n      independent, but in 2001, the SEC       \n      amended the Exemptive Rules to          \n      require that a majority of a mutual     \n      fund board be independent. In 2005,     \n      the SEC proposed increasing the         \n      independence threshold to 75%. In       \n      2006, a federal appeals court ordered   \n      that this rule amendment be put back    \n      out for public comment, putting it      \n      back into \u0093proposed rule\u0094 status. Since   \n      mutual fund boards play a vital role    \n      in overseeing the relationship between  \n      the fund and its investment manager,    \n      there is greater need for independent   \n      oversight than there is for an          \n      operating company                       \n      board.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      When the auditor is not up for          \n      ratification \u0097 We do not recommend       \n      voting against the                      \n      audit committee if the auditor is not   \n      up for ratification. Due to the         \n      different legal structure of an         \n      investment company compared to an       \n      operating company, the auditor for the  \n      investment company (i.e., mutual fund)  \n      does not conduct the same level of      \n      financial review for each investment    \n      company as for an operating company.    \n                                              \n                                              \n      Non-independent chair \u0097 The SEC has      \n      proposed that                           \n      the chair of the fund board be          \n      independent. We agree that the roles    \n      of a mutual fund\u0092s chair and CEO should  \n      be separate. Although we believe this   \n      would be best at all companies, we      \n      recommend voting against the chair of   \n      an investment                           \n      company\u0092s nominating committee as well   \n      as the board chair if the chair and     \n      CEO of a mutual fund are the same       \n      person and the fund does not have an    \n      independent lead or presiding           \n      director. Seven former SEC              \n      commissioners support the appointment   \n      of                                      \n      an independent chair and we agree with  \n      them that \u0093an independent board chair    \n      would be better able to create          \n      conditions favoring the long-term       \n      interests of fund shareholders than     \n      would a chair who is an executive of    \n      the advisor.\u0094 (See the                   \n      comment letter sent to the SEC in       \n      support of the proposed rule at         \n      http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/indch\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Multiple funds overseen by the same     \n      director \u0097 Unlike service on a public    \n      company board,                          \n      mutual fund boards require much less    \n      of a time commitment. Mutual fund       \n      directors typically serve on dozens of  \n      other mutual fund boards, often within  \n      the same fund complex. The Investment   \n      Company Institute\u0092s (ICI) Overview of    \n      Fund Governance                         \n      Practices, 1994-2012, indicates that    \n      the average number of funds served by   \n      an independent director in 2012 was     \n      53. Absent evidence that a specific     \n      director is hindered from being an      \n      effective board member at a fund due    \n      to service on other                     \n      funds\u0092 boards, we refrain from           \n      maintaining a cap on the number of      \n      outside mutual fund boards that we      \n      believe a director can serve on.        \n                                              \nDeclassified Boards\n\nGlass Lewis favors the repeal of staggered\nboards and the annual election of directors.\nWe believe staggered boards are less\naccountable to shareholders than boards that\nare elected annually. Furthermore, we feel the\nannual election of directors encourages board\nmembers to focus on shareholder interests.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  30  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nEmpirical studies have shown: (i) staggered\nboards are associated with a reduction in a\nfirm\u0092s valuation; and (ii) in the context of\nhostile takeovers, staggered boards operate as\na takeover defense, which entrenches\nmanagement, discourages potential acquirers,\nand delivers a lower return to target\nshareholders.\n\nIn our view, there is no evidence to\ndemonstrate that staggered boards improve\nshareholder returns in a takeover context.\nSome research has indicated that shareholders\nare worse off when a staggered board blocks a\ntransaction; further, when a staggered board\nnegotiates a friendly transaction, no\nstatistically significant difference in\npremium occurs. 35Additional research found\nthat charter-based staggered boards \u0093reduce\nthe market value of a firm by 4% to 6% of its\nmarket capitalization\u0094 and that \u0093staggered\nboards bring about and not merely reflect this\nreduction in market value.\u0094 36A subsequent\nstudy reaffirmed that classified boards reduce\nshareholder value, finding \u0093that the ongoing\nprocess of dismantling staggered boards,\nencouraged by institutional investors, could\nwell contribute to increasing shareholder\nwealth.\u0094 37\n\nShareholders have increasingly come to agree\nwith this view. In 2019, 90% of S&P 500\ncompanies had declassified boards, up from 68%\nin 2009. 38Management proposals to declassify\nboards are approved with near unanimity and\nshareholder proposals on the topic also\nreceive strong shareholder support; in 2014,\nshareholder proposals requesting that\ncompanies declassify their boards received\naverage support of 84% (excluding abstentions\nand broker non-votes),whereas in 1987, only\n16.4% of votes cast favored board\ndeclassification. 39Further, a growing number\nof companies, nearly half of all those\ntargeted by shareholder proposals requesting\nthat all directors stand for election\nannually, either recommended shareholders\nsupport the proposal or made no\nrecommendation, a departure from the more\ntraditional management recommendation to vote\nagainst shareholder proposals.\n\nGiven our belief that declassified boards\npromote director accountability, the empirical\nevidence suggesting staggered boards reduce a\ncompany\u0092s value and the established\nshareholder opposition to such a structure,\nGlass Lewis supports the declassification of\nboards and the annual election of directors.\n\nBoard Composition and Refreshment\n\nGlass Lewis strongly supports routine director\nevaluation, including independent external\nreviews, and periodic board refreshment to\nfoster the sharing of diverse perspectives in\nthe boardroom and the generation of new ideas\nand business strategies. Further, we believe\nthe board should evaluate the need for changes\nto board composition based on an analysis of\nskills and experience necessary for the\ncompany, as well as the results of the\ndirector evaluations, as opposed to relying\nsolely on age or tenure limits. When\nnecessary, shareholders can address concerns\nregarding proper board composition through\ndirector elections.\n\nIn our view, a director\u0092s experience can be a\nvaluable asset to shareholders because of the\ncomplex, critical issues that boards face.\nThis said, we recognize that in rare\ncircumstances, a lack of refreshment can\ncontribute to a lack of board responsiveness\nto poor company performance.\n\nWe will note as a potential concern instances\nwhere the average tenure of non-\nexecutivedirectors is 10 years or more and no\nnew directors have joined the board in the\npast five years.

Some shareholders support\nterm limits as a way to force change in such\ncircumstances.\n\nWhile we understand that age limits can aid\nboard succession planning, the long-term\nimpact of age limits restricts experienced and\npotentially valuable board members from\nservice through an arbitrary means. We believe\nthat shareholders are better off monitoring\nthe board\u0092s overall composition, including the\ndiversity of its members, the alignment of the\nboard\u0092s areas of expertise with a company\u0092s\nstrategy, the board\u0092s approach to corporate\ngovernance, and its stewardship of company\nperformance, rather than imposing inflexible\nrules that don\u0092t necessarily correlate with\nreturns or benefits for shareholders.\n\nHowever, if a board adopts term/age limits, it\nshould follow through and not waive such\nlimits. In cases where the board waives its\nterm/age limits for two or more consecutive\nyears, Glass Lewis will generally recommend\nthat shareholders vote against the nominating\nand/or governance committee chair, unless a\ncompelling rationale is provided for why the\nboard is proposing to waive this rule, such as\nconsummation of a corporate transaction.\n\nBoard Diversity\n\nGlass Lewis recognizes the importance of\nensuring that the board is composed of\ndirectors who have a diversity of skills,\nthought and experience, as such diversity\nbenefits companies by providing a broad range\nof perspectives and insights. Glass Lewis\nclosely reviews the composition of the board\nfor representation of diverse director\ncandidates.\n\nBoard Gender Diversity\n\nWe consider the nominating and governance\ncommittee to be responsible for ensuring\nsufficient board diversity, or for publicly\ncommunicating its rationale or a plan for\nincreasing diversity. As such, we will\ngenerally recommend voting against the chair\nof the nominating committee of a board that is\nnot at least 30 percent gender diverse, or all\nmembers of the nominating committee of a board\nwith no gender diverse directors, at companies\nwithin the Russell 3000 index. For companies\noutside the Russell 3000 index, our policy\nrequires a minimum of one gender diverse\ndirector.\n\nWhen making these voting recommendations, we\nwill carefully review a company\u0092s disclosure\nof its diversity considerations and may\nrefrain from recommending that shareholders\nvote against directors when boards have\nprovided sufficient rationale for the lack of\ndiversity or a plan to address the lack of\ndiversity, including a timeline of when the\nboard intends to appoint additional gender\ndiverse directors (generally by the next\nannual meeting or as soon as reasonably\npracticable).\n\nWe may extend our gender diversity\nrecommendations to additional members of the\nnominating committee in cases where the\ncommittee chair is not standing for election\ndue to a classified board, or based on other\nfactors, including the company\u0092s size and\nindustry, applicable laws in its state of\nheadquarters, and its overall governance\nprofile.\n\nBoard Underrepresented Community Diversity\n\nWe will generally recommend against the chair\nof the nominating committee of a board with\nfewer than one director from an\nunderrepresented community on the board at\ncompanies within the Russell 1000 index.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  32  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nWe define \u0093underrepresented community\ndirector\u0094 as an individual who self-identifies\nas Black, African American, North African,\nMiddle Eastern, Hispanic, Latino, Asian,\nPacific Islander, Native American, Native\nHawaiian, or Alaskan Native, or who self-\nidentifies as a member of the LGBTQIA+\ncommunity. For the purposes of this\nevaluation, we will rely solely on self-\nidentified demographic information as\ndisclosed in company proxy statements.\n\nWhen making these voting recommendations, we\nwill carefully review a company\u0092s disclosure\nof its diversity considerations and may\nrefrain from recommending that shareholders\nvote against directors when boards have\nprovided a sufficient rationale or plan to\naddress the lack of diversity on the board,\nincluding a timeline to appoint additional\ndirectors from an underrepresented community\n(generally by the next annual meeting or as\nsoon as reasonably practicable).\n\nWe may extend our underrepresented community\ndiversity recommendations to additional\nmembers of the nominating committee in cases\nwhere the committee chair is not standing for\nelection due to a classified board, or based\non other factors, including the company\u0092s size\nand industry, applicable laws in its state of\nheadquarters, and its overall governance\nprofile.\n\nState Laws on Diversity\n\nSeveral states have begun to encourage board\ndiversity through legislation. Some state laws\nimposed mandatory board composition\nrequirements, while other states have enacted\nor are considering legislation that encourages\ncompanies to diversify their boards but does\nnot mandate board composition requirements.\nFurthermore, several states have enacted or\nare considering enacting certain disclosure or\nreporting requirements in filings made with\neach respective state annually.\n\nGlass Lewis will recommend in accordance with\nmandatory board composition requirements set\nforth in applicable state laws when they come\ninto effect. We will generally refrain from\nrecommending against directors when applicable\nstate laws do not mandate board composition\nrequirements, are non-binding,or solely impose\ndisclosure or reporting requirements.\n\nWe note that during 2022, California\u0092s Senate\nBill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 regarding board\ngender and \u0093underrepresented community\u0094\ndiversity, respectively, were both deemed to\nviolate the equal protection clause of the\nCalifornia state constitution. These laws are\ncurrently in the appeals process.\n\nAccordingly, where we previously recommended\nin accordance with mandatory board composition\nrequirements set forth in California\u0092s SB 826\nand AB 979, we will refrain from providing\nrecommendations pursuant to these state board\ncomposition requirements until further notice\nwhile we continue to monitor the appeals\nprocess. However, we will continue to monitor\ncompliance with these requirements.\n\nDisclosure of Director Diversity and Skills\n\nBecause company disclosure is critical when\nmeasuring the mix of diverse attributes and\nskills of directors, Glass Lewis assesses the\nquality of such disclosure in companies\u0092 proxy\nstatements. Accordingly, we reflect how a\ncompany\u0092s proxy statement presents: (i) the\nboard\u0092s current percentage of racial/ethnic\ndiversity; (ii) whether the board\u0092s definition\nof diversity explicitly includes gender and/or\nrace/ethnicity; (iii) whether the board has\nadopted a policy requiring women and\nminorities to be included in the initial pool\nof candidates when selecting new director\nnominees (aka \u0093Rooney Rule\u0094); and (iv) board\nskills disclosure. Such ratings will help\ninform our assessment of a company\u0092s overall\ngovernance and may be a contributing factor in\nour recommendations when additional board-\nrelated concerns have been identified.\n\nAt companies in the Russell 1000 index that\nhave not provided any disclosure in any of the\nabove categories, we will generally recommend\nvoting against the chair of the nominating\nand/or governance committee. Further, when\ncompanies in the Russell 1000 index have not\nprovided any disclosure of individual or\naggregate\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  33  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nracial/ethnic minority board demographic\ninformation, we will generally recommend\nvoting against the chair of the nominating\nand/or governance committee.\n\nProxy Access\n\nIn lieu of running their own contested\nelection, proxy access would not only allow\ncertain shareholders to nominate directors to\ncompany boards but the shareholder nominees\nwould be included on the company\u0092s ballot,\nsignificantly enhancing the ability of\nshareholders to play a meaningful role in\nselecting their representatives. Glass Lewis\ngenerally supports affording shareholders the\nright to nominate director candidates to\nmanagement\u0092s proxy as a means to ensure that\nsignificant, long-term shareholders have an\nability to nominate candidates to the board.\n\nCompanies generally seek shareholder approval\nto amend company bylaws to adopt proxy access\nin response to shareholder engagement or\npressure, usually in the form of a shareholder\nproposal requesting proxy access, although\nsome companies may adopt some elements of\nproxy access without prompting. Glass Lewis\nconsiders several factors when evaluating\nwhether to support proposals for companies to\nadopt proxy access including the specified\nminimum ownership and holding requirement for\nshareholders to nominate one or more\ndirectors, as well as company size,\nperformance and responsiveness to\nshareholders.\n\nFor a discussion of recent regulatory events\nin this area, along with a detailed overview\nof the Glass Lewis approach to shareholder\nproposals regarding Proxy Access, refer to\nGlass Lewis\u0092 Proxy Paper Guidelines for\nShareholder Proposals & ESG-RelatedIssues,\navailable atwww.glasslewis.com.\n\nMajority Vote for Election of Directors\n\nMajority voting for the election of directors\nis fast becoming the de facto standard in\ncorporate board elections. In our view, the\nmajority voting proposals are an effort to\nmake the case for shareholder impact on\ndirector elections on a company-specific\nbasis.\n\nWhile this proposal would not give\nshareholders the opportunity to nominate\ndirectors or lead to elections where\nshareholders have a choice among director\ncandidates, if implemented, the proposal would\nallow shareholders to have a voice in\ndetermining whether the nominees proposed by\nthe board should actually serve as the\noverseer-representatives of shareholders in\nthe boardroom. We believe this would be a\nfavorable outcome for shareholders.\n\nThe number of shareholder proposals requesting\nthat companies adopt a majority voting\nstandard has declined significantly during the\npast decade, largely as a result of widespread\nadoption of majority voting or director\nresignation policies at U.S. companies. In\n2019, 89% of the S&P 500 Index had implemented\na resignation policy for directors failing to\nreceive majority shareholder support, compared\nto 65% in 2009. 40\n\nThe Plurality Vote Standard\n\nToday, most U.S. companies still elect\ndirectors by a plurality vote standard. Under\nthat standard, if one shareholder holding only\none share votes in favor of a nominee\n(including that director, if the director is a\nshareholder), that nominee \u0093wins\u0094 the election\nand assumes a seat on the board. The common\nconcern among companies with a plurality\nvoting standard is the possibility that one or\nmore directors would not receive a majority of\nvotes, resulting in \u0093failed elections.\u0094\n\n40Spencer Stuart Board Index, 2019, p. 15.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  34  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nAdvantages of a Majority Vote Standard\n\nIf a majority vote standard were implemented,\na nominee would have to receive the support of\na majority of the shares voted in order to be\nelected. Thus, shareholders could collectively\nvote to reject a director they believe will\nnot pursue their best interests. Given that so\nfew directors (less than 100 a year) do not\nreceive majority support from shareholders, we\nthink that a majority vote standard is\nreasonable since it will neither result in\nmany failed director elections nor reduce the\nwillingness of qualified, shareholder-focused\ndirectors to serve in the future. Further,\nmost directors who fail to receive a majority\nshareholder vote in favor of their election do\nnot step down, underscoring the need for true\nmajority voting.\n\nWe believe that a majority vote standard will\nlikely lead to more attentive directors.\nAlthough shareholders only rarely fail to\nsupport directors, the occasional majority\nvote against a director\u0092s election will likely\ndeter the election of directors with a record\nof ignoring shareholder interests. Glass Lewis\nwill therefore generally support proposals\ncalling for the election of directors by a\nmajority vote, excepting contested director\nelections.\n\nIn response to the high level of support\nmajority voting has garnered, many companies\nhave voluntarily taken steps to implement\nmajority voting or modified approaches to\nmajority voting. These steps range from a\nmodified approach requiring directors that\nreceive a majority of withheld votes to resign\n(i.e., a resignation policy) to actually\nrequiring a majority vote of outstanding\nshares to elect directors.\n\nWe feel that the modified approach does not go\nfar enough because requiring a director to\nresign is not the same as requiring a majority\nvote to elect a director and does not allow\nshareholders a definitive voice in the\nelection process. Further, under the modified\napproach, the corporate governance committee\ncould reject a resignation and, even if it\naccepts the resignation, the corporate\ngovernance committee decides on the director\u0092s\nreplacement. And since the modified approach\nis usually adopted as a policy by the board or\na board committee, it could be altered by the\nsame board or committee at any time.\n\nConflicting and Excluded Proposals\n\nSEC Rule 14a-8(i)(9)allows companies to\nexclude shareholder proposals \u0093if the proposal\ndirectly conflicts with one of the company\u0092s\nown proposals to be submitted to shareholders\nat the same meeting.\u0094 On October 22, 2015, the\nSEC issued Staff Legal Bulletin No. 14H (SLB\n14H) clarifying its rule concerning the\nexclusion of certain shareholder proposals\nwhen similar items are also on the ballot. SLB\n14H increased the burden on companies to prove\nto SEC staff that a conflict exists;\ntherefore, many companies still chose to place\nmanagement proposals alongside similar\nshareholder proposals in many cases.\n\nDuring the 2018 proxy season, a new trend in\nthe SEC\u0092s interpretation of this rule emerged.\nUpon submission of shareholder proposals\nrequesting that companies adopt a lower\nspecial meeting threshold, several companies\npetitioned the SEC for no-actionrelief under\nthe premise that the shareholder proposals\nconflicted with management\u0092s own special\nmeeting proposals, even though the management\nproposals set a higher threshold than those\nrequested by the proponent. No-actionrelief\nwas granted to these companies; however, the\nSEC stipulated that the companies must state\nin the rationale for the management proposals\nthat a vote in favor of management\u0092s proposal\nwas tantamount to a vote against the adoption\nof a lower special meeting threshold. In\ncertain instances, shareholder proposals to\nlower an existing special meeting right\nthreshold were excluded on the basis that they\nconflicted with management proposals seeking\nto ratify the existing special meeting rights.\nWe find the exclusion of these shareholder\nproposals to be especially problematic as, in\nthese instances, shareholders are not offered\nany enhanced shareholder right, nor would the\napproval (or rejection) of the ratification\nproposal initiate any type of meaningful\nchange to shareholders\u0092 rights.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  35  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nIn instances where companies have excluded\nshareholder proposals, such as those instances\nwhere special meeting shareholder proposals\nare excluded as a result of \u0093conflicting\u0094\nmanagement proposals, Glass Lewis will take a\ncase-by-caseapproach, taking into account the\nfollowing issues:\n                                              \n      The threshold proposed by the           \n      shareholder resolution;                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      The threshold proposed or established   \n      by management and the attendant         \n      rationale for the threshold;            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Whether management\u0092s proposal is         \n      seeking to ratify an existing special   \n      meeting right or adopt a                \n      bylaw that would establish a special    \n      meeting right; and                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      The company\u0092s overall governance         \n      profile, including its overall          \n      responsiveness to and engagement        \n      with shareholders.                      \n                                              \nGlass Lewis generally favors a 10-15%special\nmeeting right. Accordingly, Glass Lewis will\ngenerally recommend voting for management or\nshareholder proposals that fall within this\nrange. When faced with conflicting proposals,\nGlass Lewis will generally recommend in favor\nof the lower special meeting right and will\nrecommend voting against the proposal with the\nhigher threshold. However, in instances where\nthere are conflicting management and\nshareholder proposals and a company has not\nestablished a special meeting right, Glass\nLewis may recommend that shareholders vote in\nfavor of the shareholder proposal and that\nthey abstain from a management-proposed bylaw\namendment seeking to establish a special\nmeeting right. We believe that an abstention\nis appropriate in this instance in order to\nensure that shareholders are sending a clear\nsignal regarding their preference for the\nappropriate threshold for a special meeting\nright, while not directly opposing the\nestablishment of such a right.\n\nIn cases where the company excludes a\nshareholder proposal seeking a reduced special\nmeeting right by means of ratifying a\nmanagement proposal that is materially\ndifferent from the shareholder proposal, we\nwill generally recommend voting against the\nchair or members of the governance committee.\n\nIn other instances of conflicting management\nand shareholder proposals, Glass Lewis will\nconsider the following:\n                                           \n      The nature of the underlying issue;  \n                                           \n                                              \n      The benefit to shareholders of          \n      implementing the proposal;              \n                                              \n                                              \n      The materiality of the differences      \n      between the terms of the shareholder    \n      proposal and management                 \n      proposal;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      The context of a company\u0092s shareholder   \n      base, corporate structure and other     \n      relevant                                \n      circumstances; and                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      A company\u0092s overall governance profile   \n      and, specifically, its responsiveness   \n      to shareholders as                      \n      evidenced by a company\u0092s response to     \n      previous shareholder proposals and its  \n      adoption of progressive shareholder     \n      rights provisions.                      \n                                              \nIn recent years, we have seen the dynamic\nnature of the considerations given by the SEC\nwhen determining whether companies may exclude\ncertain shareholder proposals. We understand\nthat not all shareholder proposals serve the\nlong-term interests of shareholders, and value\nand respect the limitations placed on\nshareholder proponents, as certain shareholder\nproposals can unduly burden companies.\nHowever, Glass Lewis believes that\nshareholders should be able to vote on issues\nof material importance.\n\nWe view the shareholder proposal process as an\nimportant part of advancing shareholder rights\nand encouraging responsible and financially\nsustainable business practices. While\nrecognizing that certain proposals cross the\nline between the purview of shareholders and\nthat of the board, we generally believe that\ncompanies should not limit investors\u0092 ability\nto vote on shareholder proposals that advance\ncertain rights or promote beneficial\ndisclosure. Accordingly, Glass Lewis will make\nnote of instances where a company has\nsuccessfully petitioned the SEC to exclude\nshareholder proposals. If after review we\nbelieve that the exclusion of a shareholder\nproposal is detrimental to shareholders, we\nmay, in certain very limited circumstances,\nrecommend against members of the governance\ncommittee.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  36  \n  States                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n   Transparency and Integrity                 \n   in Financial Reporting                     \n                                              \nAuditor Ratification\n\nThe auditor\u0092s role as gatekeeper is crucial in\nensuring the integrity and transparency of the\nfinancial information necessary for protecting\nshareholder value. Shareholders rely on the\nauditor to ask tough questions and to do a\nthorough analysis of a company\u0092s books to\nensure that the information provided to\nshareholders is complete, accurate, fair, and\nthat it is a reasonable representation of a\ncompany\u0092s financial position. The only way\nshareholders can make rational investment\ndecisions is if the market is equipped with\naccurate information about a company\u0092s fiscal\nhealth. As stated in the October 6, 2008 Final\nReport of the Advisory Committee on the\nAuditing Profession to the U.S. Department of\nthe Treasury:\n\n\u0093 The auditor is expected to offer critical\nand objective judgment on the financial\nmatters under consideration, and actual and\nperceived absence of conflicts is critical to\nthat expectation. The Committee believes that\nauditors, investors, public companies, and\nother market participants must understand the\nindependence requirements and their\nobjectives, and that auditors must adopt a\nmindset of skepticism when facing situations\nthat may compromise their independence.\u0094\n\nAs such, shareholders should demand an\nobjective, competent and diligent auditor who\nperforms at or above professional standards at\nevery company in which the investors hold an\ninterest. Like directors, auditors should be\nfree from conflicts of interest and should\navoid situations requiring a choice between\nthe auditor\u0092s interests and the public\u0092s\ninterests. Almost without exception,\nshareholders should be able to annually review\nan auditor\u0092s performance and to annually\nratify a board\u0092s auditor selection. Moreover,\nin October 2008, the Advisory Committee on the\nAuditing Profession went even further, and\nrecommended that \u0093to further enhance audit\ncommittee oversight and auditor accountability\n... disclosure in the company proxy statement\nregarding shareholder ratification [should]\ninclude the name(s) of the senior auditing\npartner(s) staffed on the engagement.\u0094 41\n\nOn August 16, 2011, the PCAOB issued a Concept\nRelease seeking public comment on ways that\nauditor independence, objectivity and\nprofessional skepticism could be enhanced,\nwith a specific emphasis on mandatory audit\nfirm rotation. The PCAOB convened several\npublic roundtable meetings during 2012 to\nfurther discuss such matters. Glass Lewis\nbelieves auditor rotation can ensure both the\nindependence of the auditor and the integrity\nof the audit; we will typically recommend\nsupporting proposals to require auditor\nrotation when the proposal uses a reasonable\nperiod of time (usually not less than\n5-7years), particularly at companies with a\nhistory of accounting problems.\n\n41\u0093Final Report of the Advisory Committee on\nthe Auditing Profession to the U.S. Department\nof the Treasury.\u0094 p. VIII:20, October 6, 2008.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  37  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nOn June 1, 2017, the PCAOB adopted new\nstandards to enhance auditor reports by\nproviding additional important information to\ninvestors. For companies with fiscal year end\ndates on or after December 15, 2017, reports\nwere required to include the year in which the\nauditor began serving consecutively as the\ncompany\u0092s auditor. For large accelerated\nfilers with fiscal year ends of June 30, 2019\nor later, and for all other companies with\nfiscal year ends of December 15, 2020 or\nlater, communication of critical audit matters\n(CAMs) will also be required. CAMs are matters\nthat have been communicated to the audit\ncommittee, are related to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the financial\nstatements, and involve especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex auditor\njudgment.\n\nGlass Lewis believes the additional reporting\nrequirements are beneficial for investors. The\nadditional disclosures can provide investors\nwith information that is critical to making an\ninformed judgment about an auditor\u0092s\nindependence and performance. Furthermore, we\nbelieve the additional requirements are an\nimportant step toward enhancing the relevance\nand usefulness of auditor reports, which too\noften are seen as boilerplate compliance\ndocuments that lack the relevant details to\nprovide meaningful insight into a particular\naudit.\n\nVoting Recommendations on Auditor Ratification\n\nWe generally support management\u0092s choice of\nauditor except when we believe the auditor\u0092s\nindependence or audit integrity has been\ncompromised. Where a board has not allowed\nshareholders to review and ratify an auditor,\nwe typically recommend voting against the\naudit committee chair. When there have been\nmaterial restatements of annual financial\nstatements or material weaknesses in internal\ncontrols, we usually recommend voting against\nthe entire audit committee.\n\nReasons why we may not recommend ratification\nof an auditor include:\n                                              \n      When audit fees plus audit-related      \n      fees total less than the tax fees       \n      and/or other non-audit fees.            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Recent material restatements of annual  \n      financial statements, including those   \n      resulting in the                        \n      reporting of material weaknesses in     \n      internal controls and including late    \n      filings by the company where the        \n      auditor bears some responsibility for   \n      the restatement or late filing.42       \n                                              \n                                              \n      When the auditor performs prohibited    \n      services such as                        \n      tax-shelter work, tax services for the  \n      CEO or CFO, or contingent-fee work,     \n      such as a fee based on a percentage of  \n      economic benefit to the company.        \n                                              \n                                              \n      When audit fees are excessively low,    \n      especially when compared with other     \n      companies in the same                   \n      industry.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      When the company has aggressive         \n      accounting policies.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      When the company has poor disclosure    \n      or lack of transparency in its          \n      financial statements.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      Where the auditor limited its           \n      liability through its contract with     \n      the company or the audit contract       \n      requires the corporation to use         \n      alternative dispute resolution          \n      procedures without adequate             \n      justification.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      We also look for other relationships    \n      or concerns with the auditor that       \n      might suggest a conflict                \n      between the auditor\u0092s interests and      \n      shareholder interests.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      In determining whether shareholders     \n      would benefit from rotating the         \n      company\u0092s auditor, where                 \n      relevant we will consider factors that  \n      may call into question an auditor\u0092s      \n      effectiveness, including auditor        \n      tenure, a pattern of inaccurate         \n      audits, and any ongoing litigation or   \n      significant controversies. When Glass   \n      Lewis considers ongoing                 \n      litigation and significant              \n      controversies, it is mindful that such  \n      matters may involve unadjudicated       \n      allegations. Glass Lewis does not       \n      assume the truth of such allegations    \n      or that the law has been violated.      \n      Instead, Glass Lewis focuses more       \n      broadly                                 \n      on whether, under the particular facts  \n      and circumstances presented, the        \n      nature and number of such lawsuits or   \n                                              \n42An auditor does not audit interim financial\nstatements. Thus, we generally do not believe\nthat an auditor should be opposed due to a\nrestatement of interim financial statements\nunless the nature of the misstatement is clear\nfrom a reading of the incorrect financial\nstatements.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  38  \n  States                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  other significant controversies reflects    \n  on the                                      \n  risk profile of the company or suggests     \n  that                                        \n  appropriate risk mitigation measures may    \n  be                                          \n  warranted.\u0094                                  \n                                              \nPension Accounting Issues\n\nA pension accounting question occasionally\nraised in proxy proposals is what effect, if\nany, projected returns on employee pension\nassets should have on a company\u0092s net income.\nThis issue often arises in the executive-\ncompensation context in a discussion of the\nextent to which pension accounting should be\nreflected in business performance for purposes\nof calculating payments to executives.\n\nGlass Lewis believes that pension credits\nshould not be included in measuring income\nthat is used to award performance-based\ncompensation. Because many of the assumptions\nused in accounting for retirement plans are\nsubject to the company\u0092s discretion,\nmanagement would have an obvious conflict of\ninterest if pay were tied to pension income.\nIn our view, projected income from pensions\ndoes not truly reflect a company\u0092s\nperformance.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  39  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nThe Link Between Compensation and Performance\n\nGlass Lewis carefully reviews the compensation\nawarded to senior executives, as we believe\nthat this is an important area in which the\nboard\u0092s priorities are revealed. Glass Lewis\nstrongly believes executive compensation\nshould be linked directly with the performance\nof the business the executive is charged with\nmanaging. We believe the most effective\ncompensation arrangements provide for an\nappropriate mix of performance-based short-\nand long-term incentives in addition to fixed\npay elements while promoting a prudent and\nsustainable level of risk-taking.\n\nGlass Lewis believes that comprehensive,\ntimely and transparent disclosure of executive\npay is critical to allowing shareholders to\nevaluate the extent to which pay is aligned\nwith company performance. When reviewing proxy\nmaterials, Glass Lewis examines whether the\ncompany discloses the performance metrics used\nto determine executive compensation. We\nrecognize performance metrics must necessarily\nvary depending on the company and industry,\namong other factors, and may include a wide\nvariety of financial measures as well as\nindustry-specific performance indicators.\nHowever, we believe companies should disclose\nwhy the specific performance metrics were\nselected and how the actions they are designed\nto incentivize will lead to better corporate\nperformance.\n\nMoreover, it is rarely in shareholders\u0092\ninterests to disclose competitive data about\nindividual salaries below the senior executive\nlevel. Such disclosure could create internal\npersonnel discord that would be\ncounterproductive for the company and its\nshareholders. We do not believe shareholders\nneed or will benefit from detailed reports\nabout individual management employees other\nthan the most senior executives.\n\nAdvisory Vote on Executive Compensation (Say-\non-Pay)\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (the \u0093Dodd-Frank Act\u0094) required\nmost companies to hold an advisory vote on\nexecutive compensation at the first\nshareholder meeting that occurs six months\nafter enactment of the bill (January 21,\n2011).\n\nThis practice of allowing shareholders a non-\nbindingvote on a company\u0092s compensation report\nis standard practice in many\nnon-U.S.countries, and has been a requirement\nfor most companies in the United Kingdom since\n2003 and in Australia since 2005. Although\nsay-on-payproposals are non-binding,a high\nlevel of \u0093against\u0094 or \u0093abstain\u0094 votes\nindicates substantial shareholder concern\nabout a company\u0092s compensation policies and\nprocedures.\n\nGiven the complexity of most companies\u0092\ncompensation programs, Glass Lewis applies a\nhighly nuanced approach when analyzing\nadvisory votes on executive compensation. We\nreview each company\u0092s compensation on a case-\nby-casebasis, recognizing that each company\nmust be examined in the context of industry,\nsize, maturity, performance, financial\ncondition, its historic pay for performance\npractices, and any other relevant internal or\nexternal factors.\n\nWe believe that each company should design and\napply specific compensation policies and\npractices that are appropriate to the\ncircumstances of the company and, in\nparticular, will attract and retain competent\nexecutives and other staff, while motivating\nthem to grow the company\u0092s long-term\nshareholder value.\n\nWhere we find those specific policies and\npractices serve to reasonably align\ncompensation with performance, and such\npractices are adequately disclosed, Glass\nLewis will recommend supporting the company\u0092s\napproach. If, however, those specific policies\nand practices fail to demonstrably link\ncompensation with performance, Glass Lewis\nwill generally recommend voting against the\nsay-on-payproposal.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  40  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nGlass Lewis reviews say-on-payproposals on\nboth a qualitative basis and a quantitative\nbasis, with a focus on several main areas:\n                                              \n      The overall design and structure of     \n      the company\u0092s executive compensation     \n      programs including                      \n      selection and challenging nature of     \n      performance metrics;                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      The implementation and effectiveness    \n      of the company\u0092s executive compensation  \n      programs including                      \n      pay mix and use of performance metrics  \n      in determining pay levels;              \n                                              \n                                              \n      The quality and content of the          \n      company\u0092s disclosure;                    \n                                              \n                                           \n      The quantum paid to executives; and  \n                                           \n                                              \n      The link between compensation and       \n      performance as indicated by the         \n      company\u0092s current and past               \n      pay-for-performance grades.             \n                                              \nWe also review any significant changes or\nmodifications, including post fiscal year-\nendchanges and one-timeawards, particularly\nwhere the changes touch upon issues that are\nmaterial to Glass Lewis recommendations.\nAdditionally, while we recognize their rarity\nin the U.S. market, beneficial features such\nas but not limited to post-vesting and/or\npost-retirement holding requirements may be\nviewed positively in our holistic analysis.\n\nSay-on-PayVoting Recommendations\n\nIn cases where we find deficiencies in a\ncompany\u0092s compensation program\u0092s design,\nimplementation or management, we will\nrecommend that shareholders vote against the\nsay-on-payproposal. Generally, such instances\ninclude:\n                                              \n      Evidence of a pattern of poor           \n      pay-for-performance practices (e.g.,    \n      deficient or failing                    \n      pay-for-performance grades or a         \n      misalignment between incentive payouts  \n      and the shareholder experience),        \n                                              \n                                              \n      Unclear or questionable disclosure      \n      regarding the overall compensation      \n      structure (e.g., limited                \n      information regarding benchmarking      \n      processes, limited rationale for bonus  \n      performance metrics and targets,        \n      etc.),                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Questionable adjustments to certain     \n      aspects of the overall compensation     \n      structure (e.g., limited                \n      rationale for significant changes to    \n      performance targets or metrics, the     \n      payout of guaranteed bonuses or         \n      sizable retention grants, etc.),        \n      and/or                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Other egregious compensation            \n      practices.                              \n                                              \nGlass Lewis approaches its analysis of\nexecutive compensation programs on a case-by-\ncasebasis. Glass Lewis reviews all factors\nrelated to named executive officer\ncompensation, including quantitative analyses,\nstructural features, the presence of effective\nbest practice policies, disclosure quality and\ntrajectory-related factors. Except for\nparticularly egregious pay decisions and\npractices, no one factor would ordinarily lead\nto an unfavorable recommendation without a\nreview of the company\u0092s rationale and/or the\ninfluence of such decisions or practices on\nother aspects of the pay program, most notably\nthe company\u0092s ability to align executive pay\nwith performance and the shareholder\nexperience.\n\nAlthough not an exhaustive list, the following\nfactors are viewed negatively. When weighed\ntogether, they may cause Glass Lewis to\nrecommend voting against a say-on-payvote:\n                                              \n      Inappropriate or outsized               \n      self-selected peer groups and/or        \n      benchmarking issues such as             \n      compensation                            \n      targets set well above the median       \n      without adequate justification;         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Egregious or excessive bonuses, equity  \n      awards, perquisites or severance        \n      payments, including golden              \n      handshakes and golden parachutes;       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Insufficient response to low            \n      shareholder support;                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      Problematic contractual payments, such  \n      as guaranteed bonuses;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Adjustments to performance results      \n      that lead to problematic pay outcomes;  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Insufficiently challenging performance  \n      targets and/or high potential payout    \n      opportunities;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  41  \n  States                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      Performance targets lowered without     \n      justification;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Discretionary bonuses paid when short-  \n      or long-term incentive plan targets     \n      were not met;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      High executive pay relative to peers    \n      that is not justified by outstanding    \n      company performance; and                \n                                              \n                                              \n      The terms of the long-term incentive    \n      plans are inappropriate (please see     \n      \u0093Long-Term                               \n      Incentives\u0094).                            \n                                              \nThe aforementioned issues influence Glass\nLewis\u0092 assessment of the structure of a\ncompany\u0092s compensation program. We evaluate\nstructure on a \u0093Good, Fair, Poor\u0094 rating scale\nwhereby a \u0093Good\u0094 rating represents a\ncompensation program with little to no\nconcerns and market-leading practices, a\n\u0093Fair\u0094 rating represents a compensation\nprogram with some concerns but general\nadherence to best practices and a \u0093Poor\u0094\nrating represents a compensation program that\ndeviates significantly from best practice or\ncontains one or more egregious compensation\npractices.\n\nWe believe that it is important for companies\nto provide investors with clear and complete\ndisclosure of all the significant terms of\ncompensation arrangements. Similar to\nstructure, we evaluate disclosure on a \u0093Good,\nFair, Poor\u0094 rating scale. A \u0093Good\u0094 rating\nrepresents a thorough discussion of all\nelements of compensation with rationale. A\n\u0093Fair\u0094 rating represents an adequate\ndiscussion of all or most elements of\ncompensation with rationale. A \u0093Poor\u0094 rating\nrepresents an incomplete or absent discussion\nof compensation. In instances where a company\nhas simply failed to provide sufficient\ndisclosure of its policies, we may recommend\nshareholders vote against this proposal solely\non this basis, regardless of the\nappropriateness of compensation levels. Glass\nLewis understands that regulatory disclosure\nrules such as smaller reporting company\ndisclosure standards may condone the omission\nof key executive compensation information.\nHowever, we believe that companies should\nprovide sufficient information in the proxy\nstatement to enable shareholders to vote in an\ninformed manner.\n\nIn general, most companies will fall within\nthe \u0093Fair\u0094 range for both structure and\ndisclosure, and Glass Lewis largely uses the\n\u0093Good\u0094 and \u0093Poor\u0094 ratings to highlight\noutliers.\n\nWhere we identify egregious compensation\npractices, we may also recommend voting\nagainst the compensation committee based on\nthe practices or actions of its members during\nthe year. Such practices may include approving\nlarge one-offpayments, the inappropriate,\nunjustified use of discretion, or sustained\npoor pay for performance practices. (Refer to\nthe section on \u0093Compensation Committee\nPerformance\u0094 for more information.)\n\nCompany Responsiveness\n\nWhen companies receive a significant level of\nshareholder opposition to a say-on-\npayproposal, which occurs when more than 20%\nof votes on the proposal are cast as AGAINST\nand/or ABSTAIN, we believe the board should\ndemonstrate a commensurate level of engagement\nand responsiveness to the concerns behind the\ndisapproval, with a particular focus on\nresponding to shareholder feedback. When\nassessing the level of opposition to say-on-\npayproposals, we may further examine the level\nof opposition among disinterested shareholders\nas an independent group. While we recognize\nthat sweeping changes cannot be made to a\ncompensation program without due\nconsideration, and that often a majority of\nshareholders may have voted in favor of the\nproposal, given that the average approval rate\nfor say-on-payproposals is about 90%, we\nbelieve the compensation committee should\ndemonstrate in its proxy statement a level of\nresponse to a significant vote against. In\ngeneral, our expectations regarding the\nminimum appropriate levels of responsiveness\nwill correspond with the level of shareholder\nopposition, as expressed both through the\nmagnitude of opposition in a single year, and\nthrough the persistence of shareholder\ndisapproval over time.\n\nResponses we consider appropriate include\nengaging with large shareholders, especially\ndissenting shareholders, to identify their\nconcerns, and, where reasonable, implementing\nchanges and/or making commitments that\ndirectly address those concerns within the\ncompany\u0092s compensation program. In cases where\nparticularly egregious pay decisions caused\nthe say on pay proposal to fail, Glass Lewis\nwill closely consider whether any changes were\nmade directly relating to the pay decision\nthat may address structural\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  42  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nconcerns that shareholders have. In the\nabsence of any evidence in the disclosure that\nthe board is actively engaging shareholders on\nthese issues and responding accordingly, we\nmay recommend holding compensation committee\nmembers accountable for failing to adequately\nrespond to shareholder opposition. Regarding\nsuch recommendations, careful consideration\nwill be given to the level of shareholder\nprotest and the severity and history of\ncompensation practices.\n\nPay for Performance\n\nGlass Lewis believes an integral part of a\nwell-structured compensation package is a\nsuccessful link between pay and performance.\nOur proprietary pay-for-performancemodel,\nwhich serves as our primary quantitative\nanalysis, was developed to better evaluate the\nlink between pay and performance. Generally,\ncompensation and performance are measured\nagainst a peer group of appropriate companies\nthat may overlap, to a certain extent, with a\ncompany\u0092s self-disclosed peers. This\nquantitative analysis provides a consistent\nframework and historical context for our\nclients to determine how well companies link\nexecutive compensation to relative\nperformance. Companies that demonstrate a\nweaker link are more likely to receive a\nnegative recommendation; however, other\nqualitative factors such as overall incentive\nstructure, significant forthcoming changes to\nthe compensation program or reasonable long-\nterm payout levels may mitigate our concerns\nto a certain extent.\n\nWhile we assign companies a letter grade of A,\nB, C, D or F based on the alignment between\npay and performance under our primary model,\nthe grades derived from the Glass Lewis pay-\nfor-performanceanalysis do not follow the\ntraditional U.S. school letter grade system.\nRather, the grades are generally interpreted\nas follows:\n                                              \n               The company\u0092s percentile rank   \n  Grade\u2009of\u2009A:  for pay is significantly less  \n               than its percentile rank for   \n               performance                    \n                                              \n                                              \n               The company\u0092s percentile rank   \n  Grade\u2009of\u2009B:  for pay is moderately less     \n               than its percentile rank for   \n               performance                    \n                                              \n                                              \n               The company\u0092s percentile rank   \n               for pay is approximately       \n  Grade\u2009of\u2009C:  aligned with its percentile    \n               rank for                       \n               performance                    \n                                              \n                                              \n               The company\u0092s percentile rank   \n  Grade\u2009of\u2009D:  for pay is higher than its     \n               percentile rank for            \n               performance                    \n                                              \n                                              \n               The company\u0092s percentile rank   \n               for pay is significantly       \n  Grade\u2009of\u2009F:  higher than its percentile     \n               rank for                       \n               performance                    \n                                              \nSeparately, a specific comparison between the\ncompany\u0092s executive pay and its peers\u0092\nexecutive pay levels may be discussed in the\nanalysis for additional insight into the\ngrade. Likewise, a specific comparison between\nthe company\u0092s performance and its peers\u0092\nperformance is reflected in the analysis for\nfurther context.\n\nWe use this analysis to inform our voting\ndecisions on say-on-payproposals. If a company\nreceives a \u0093D\u0094 or \u0093F\u0094 from our proprietary\nmodel, we are more likely to recommend that\nshareholders vote against the say-on-\npayproposal. However, important supplemental\nquantitative factors like analyses of realized\npay levels and the \u0093compensation actually\npaid\u0094 data mandated by the SEC\u0092s 2022 final\nrule regarding pay versus performance may be\nconsidered, and other qualitative factors such\nas an effective overall incentive structure,\nthe relevance of selected performance metrics,\nsignificant forthcoming enhancements or\nreasonable long-term payout levels may give us\ncause to recommend in favor of a proposal even\nwhen we have identified a disconnect between\npay and performance.\n\nIn determining the peer groups used in our\npay-for-performanceletter grades, Glass Lewis\nutilizes a proprietary methodology that\nconsiders both market and industry peers,\nalong with each company\u0092s self-disclosed peers\nand peers of those company-disclosed peers.\nEach component is considered on a weighted\nbasis and is subject to size-basedranking and\nscreening. Since the peer group used is based\non an independent, proprietary technique, it\nwill often differ from the one used by the\ncompany which, in turn, will affect the\nresulting analyses. While Glass Lewis believes\nthat the independent, rigorous methodology it\nuses provides a valuable perspective on the\ncompany\u0092s compensation program, the company\u0092s\nself-selected peer group may also presented in\nthe Proxy Paper for comparative purposes and\nfor supplemental analyses.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  43  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nShort-Term Incentives\n\nA short-term bonus or incentive (STI) should\nbe demonstrably tied to performance. Whenever\npossible, we believe a mix of corporate and\nindividual performance measures is\nappropriate. We would normally expect\nperformance measures for STI plans to be based\non company-wide or divisional financial\nmeasures as well as non-financial,qualitative\nor non-formulaicfactors such as those related\nto safety, environmental issues, and customer\nsatisfaction when they are material to the\ncompany\u0092s overall health. While we recognize\nthat companies operating in different sectors\nor markets may seek to utilize a wide range of\nmetrics, we expect such measures to be\nappropriately tied to a company\u0092s business\ndrivers.\n\nFurther, the threshold, target and maximum\nperformance goals and corresponding payout\nlevels that can be achieved under STI plans\nshould be disclosed. Shareholders should\nexpect stretching performance targets for the\nmaximum award to be achieved. Any increase in\nthe potential target and maximum award should\nbe clearly justified to shareholders, as\nshould any decrease in target and maximum\nperformance levels from the previous year.\n\nGlass Lewis recognizes that disclosure of some\nmeasures or performance targets may include\ncommercially confidential information.\nTherefore, we believe it may be reasonable to\nexclude such information in some cases as long\nas the company provides sufficient\njustification for non-disclosure.However,\nwhere a short-term bonus has been paid,\ncompanies should disclose the extent to which\nperformance has been achieved against relevant\ntargets, including disclosure of the actual\ntarget achieved.\n\nWhere management has received significant\nshort-term incentive payments but overall\nperformance and/or the shareholder experience\nover the measurement year prima facie appears\nto be poor or negative, we believe the company\nshould provide a clear explanation of why\nthese significant short-term payments were\nmade. We also believe any significant changes\nto the program structure should be accompanied\nby rationalizing disclosure. Further, where a\ncompany has applied upward discretion, which\nincludes lowering goals mid-year,increasing\ncalculated payouts or retroactively pro-\nratingperformance periods, we expect a robust\ndiscussion of why the decision was necessary.\n\nAdjustments to GAAP figures may be considered\nin Glass Lewis\u0092 assessment of the\neffectiveness of the incentive at tying\nexecutive pay with performance. We believe\nthat where companies use non-GAAPor bespoke\nmetrics, clear reconciliations between these\nfigures and GAAP figures in audited financial\nstatements should be provided. Moreover, Glass\nLewis believes that in circumstances where\nsignificant adjustments were applied to\nperformance results, thorough, detailed\ndiscussion of adjustments akin to a GAAP-to-\nnon-GAAPreconciliation and their impact on\npayouts within the proxy statement is\nwarranted. The absence of such enhanced\ndisclosure for significant adjustments will\nimpact Glass Lewis\u0092 assessment of the quality\nof disclosure and, in turn, may play a role in\nthe overall recommendation for the advisory\nvote on executive compensation.\n\nGlass Lewis recognizes the importance of the\ncompensation committee\u0092s prudent and\nresponsible exercise of discretion over\nincentive pay outcomes to account for\nsignificant, material events that would\notherwise be excluded from performance results\nof selected metrics of incentive programs. For\ninstance, litigation settlement charges are\ntypically removed from non-GAAPresults before\nthe determination of formulaic incentive\npayouts, or health and safety failures may not\nbe reflected in performance results where\ncompanies do not expressly include health and\nsafety metrics in incentive plans. Such events\nmay nevertheless be consequential to corporate\nperformance results, impact the shareholder\nexperience, and, in some cases, may present\nmaterial risks. Conversely, certain events may\nadversely impact formulaic payout results\ndespite being outside executives\u0092 control. We\nbelieve that companies should provide thorough\ndiscussion of how such events were considered\nin the committee\u0092s decisions to exercise\ndiscretion over incentive payouts.\n\nWe do not generally recommend against a pay\nprogram due to the use of a non-formulaicplan.\nIf a company has chosen to rely primarily on a\nsubjective assessment or the board\u0092s\ndiscretion in determining short-term bonuses,\nwe believe that the proxy statement should\nprovide a meaningful discussion of the board\u0092s\nrationale\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  44  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nin determining the bonuses paid as well as a\nrationale for the use of a non-\nformulaicmechanism. Particularly where the\naforementioned disclosures are substantial and\nsatisfactory, such a structure will not\nprovoke serious concern in our analysis on its\nown. However, in conjunction with other\nsignificant issues in a program\u0092s design or\noperation, such as a disconnect between pay\nand performance, the absence of a cap on\npayouts, or a lack of performance-based long-\nterm awards, the use of a non-formulaicbonus\nmay help drive a negative recommendation.\n\nLong-Term Incentives\n\nGlass Lewis recognizes the value of equity-\nbased incentive programs, which are often the\nprimary long-term incentive for executives.\nWhen used appropriately, they can provide a\nvehicle for linking an executive\u0092s pay to\ncompany performance, thereby aligning their\ninterests with those of shareholders. In\naddition, equity-based compensation can be an\neffective way to attract, retain and motivate\nkey employees.\n\nThere are certain elements that Glass Lewis\nbelieves are common to most well-structured\nlong-term incentive (LTI) plans. These\ninclude:\n                                              \n      No re-testing or lowering of            \n      performance conditions;                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Performance metrics that cannot be      \n      easily manipulated by management;       \n                                              \n                                        \n      Two or more performance metrics;  \n                                        \n                                              \n      At least one relative performance       \n      metric that compares the company\u0092s       \n      performance to a relevant               \n      peer group or index;                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      Performance periods of at least three   \n      years;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Stretching metrics that incentivize     \n      executives to strive for outstanding    \n      performance while not                   \n      encouraging excessive risk-taking;      \n                                              \n                                           \n      Reasonable individual award limits;  \n                                           \n                                              \n      Equity granting practices that are      \n      clearly disclosed and                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      Additional post-vesting holding         \n      periods to encourage long-term          \n      executive share ownership.              \n                                              \nIn evaluating long-term incentive grants,\nGlass Lewis generally believes that at least\nhalf of the grant should consist of\nperformance-based awards, putting a material\nportion of executive compensation at-riskand\ndemonstrably linked to the performance of the\ncompany. While we will consistently raise\nconcern with programs that do not meet this\ncriterion, we may refrain from a negative\nrecommendation in the absence of other\nsignificant issues with the program\u0092s design\nor operation. However, in cases where\nperformance-based awards are significantly\nrolled back or eliminated from a company\u0092s\nlong-term incentive plan, such decisions will\ngenerally be viewed negatively outside of\nexceptional circumstances. Given the reduction\nin rigor and accountability in the pay\nprogram, Glass Lewis will assess the\nrevision\u0092s impact on the pay program\u0092s ability\nto align executive pay with performance and\nshareholder experience; programs that fail our\nassessment may receive an unfavorable\nrecommendation. They may also lead to an\nunfavorable recommendation from Glass Lewis if\nthe change is not offset by meaningful\nrevisions such as to pay quantum and vesting\nperiods, particularly in the absence of cogent\nrationale.\n\nAs with the short-term incentive, Glass Lewis\nrecognizes the importance of the compensation\ncommittee\u0092s judicious and responsible exercise\nof discretion over incentive pay outcomes to\naccount for significant events that would\notherwise be excluded from performance results\nof selected metrics of incentive programs. We\nbelieve that companies should provide thorough\ndiscussion of how such events were considered\nin the committee\u0092s decisions to exercise\ndiscretion or refrain from applying discretion\nover incentive pay outcomes. Furthermore,\nconsiderations related to the use of non-\nGAAPmetrics under the STI plan similarly apply\nto the long-term incentive program.\n\nPerformance measures should be carefully\nselected and should relate to the specific\nbusiness/industry in which the company\noperates and, especially, to the key value\ndrivers of the company\u0092s business. As with\nshort-term incentive plans, the basis for any\nadjustments to metrics or results should be\nclearly explained, as should\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  45  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nthe company\u0092s judgment on the use of\ndiscretion and any significant changes to the\nperformance program structure.\n\nWhile cognizant of the inherent complexity of\ncertain performance metrics, Glass Lewis\ngenerally believes that measuring a company\u0092s\nperformance with multiple metrics serves to\nprovide a more complete picture of the\ncompany\u0092s performance than a single metric.\nFurther, reliance on just one metric may focus\ntoo much management attention on a single\ntarget and is therefore more susceptible to\nmanipulation. When utilized for relative\nmeasurements, external benchmarks such as a\nsector index or peer group should be disclosed\nand transparent. The rationale behind the\nselection of a specific index or peer group\nshould also be disclosed. Internal performance\nbenchmarks should also be disclosed and\ntransparent, unless a cogent case for\nconfidentiality is made and fully explained.\nSimilarly, actual performance and vesting\nlevels for previous grants earned during the\nfiscal year should be disclosed.\n\nWe also believe shareholders should evaluate\nthe relative success of a company\u0092s\ncompensation programs, particularly with\nregard to existing equity-based incentive\nplans, in linking pay and performance when\nevaluating potential changes to LTI plans and\ndetermining the impact of additional stock\nawards. We will therefore review the company\u0092s\npay-for-performanceanalyses (see above for\nmore information) and specifically the\nproportion of total compensation that is\nstock-based.\n\nGrants of Front-Loaded Awards\n\nMany U.S. companies have chosen to provide\nlarge grants, usually in the form of equity\nawards, that are intended to serve as\ncompensation for multiple years. This\npractice, often called front-loading, is taken\nup either in the regular course of business or\nas a response to specific business conditions\nand with a predetermined objective. The so-\ncalled\u0093mega-grant\u0094, an outsized award to one\nindividual sometimes valued at over $100\nmillion is sometimes but not always provided\nas a front-loaded award. We believe\nshareholders should generally be wary of this\ngranting approach, and we accordingly weigh\nthese grants with particular scrutiny.\n\nWhile the use of front-loaded awards is\nintended to lock-inexecutive service and\nincentives, the same rigidity also raises the\nrisk of effectively tying the hands of the\ncompensation committee. As compared with a\nmore responsive annual granting schedule\nprogram, front-loaded awards may preclude\nimprovements or changes to reflect evolving\nbusiness strategies or to respond to other\nunforeseen factors. Additionally, if\nstructured poorly, early vesting of such\nawards may reduce or eliminate the retentive\npower at great cost to shareholders. The\nconsiderable emphasis on a single grant can\nplace intense pressures on every facet of its\ndesign, amplifying any potential perverse\nincentives and creating greater room for\nunintended consequences. In particular,\nprovisions around changes of control or\nseparations of service must ensure that\nexecutives do not receive excessive payouts\nthat do not reflect shareholder experience or\ncompany performance.\n\nWe consider a company\u0092s rationale for granting\nawards under this structure and also expect\nany front-loaded awards to include a firm\ncommitment not to grant additional awards for\na defined period, as is commonly associated\nwith this practice. Even when such a\ncommitment is provided, unexpected\ncircumstances may lead the board to make\nadditional payments or awards for retention\npurposes, or to incentivize management towards\nmore realistic goals or a revised strategy. If\na company breaks its commitment not to grant\nfurther awards, we may recommend against the\npay program unless a convincing rationale is\nprovided. The multiyear nature of these awards\ngenerally lends itself to significantly higher\ncompensation figures in the year of grant than\nmight otherwise be expected. In our\nqualitative analysis of the grants of front-\nloaded awards to executives, Glass Lewis\nconsiders the quantum of the award on an\nannualized basis and may compare this result\nto the prior practice and peer data, among\nother benchmarks. Additionally, for awards\nthat are granted in the form of equity, Glass\nLewis may consider the total potential\ndilutive effect of such award on shareholders.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  46  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nIn situations where the front-loaded award was\nmeant to cover a certain portion of the\nregular long-term incentive grant for each\nyear during the covered period, our analysis\nof the value of the remaining portion of the\nregular long-term incentives granted during\nthe period covered by the award will account\nfor the annualized value of the front-loaded\nportion, and we expect no supplemental grant\nbe awarded during the vesting period of the\nfront-loaded portion.\n\nLinking Executive Pay to Environmental and\nSocial Criteria\n\nGlass Lewis believes that explicit\nenvironmental and/or social (E&S) criteria in\nexecutive incentive plans, when used\nappropriately, can serve to provide both\nexecutives and shareholders a clear line of\nsight into a company\u0092s ESG strategy,\nambitions, and targets. Although we are\nstrongly supportive of companies\u0092\nincorporation of material E&S risks and\nopportunities in their long-term strategic\nplanning, we believe that the inclusion of E&S\nmetrics in compensation programs should be\npredicated on each company\u0092s unique\ncircumstances. In order to establish a\nmeaningful link between pay and performance,\ncompanies must consider factors including\ntheir industry, size, risk profile, maturity,\nperformance, financial condition, and any\nother relevant internal or external factors.\n\nWhen a company is introducing E&S criteria\ninto executive incentive plans, we believe it\nis important that companies provide\nshareholders with sufficient disclosure to\nallow them to understand how these criteria\nalign withtheir strategies. Additionally,\nGlass Lewis recognizes that there may be\nsituations where certain E&S performance\ncriteria are reasonably viewed as\nprerequisites for executive performance, as\nopposed to behaviors and conditions that need\nto be incentivized. For example, we believe\nthat shareholders should interrogate the use\nof metrics that award executives for ethical\nbehavior or compliance with policies and\nregulations. It is our view that companies\nshould provide shareholders with disclosures\nthat clearly lay out the rationale for\nselecting specific E&S metrics, the target-\nsetting process, and corresponding payout\nopportunities. Further, particularly in the\ncase of qualitative metrics, we believe that\nshareholders should be provided with a clear\nunderstanding of the basis on which the\ncriteria will be assessed. Where quantitative\ntargets have been set, we believe that\nshareholders are best served when these are\ndisclosed on an ex-antebasis, or the board\nshould outline why it believes it is unable to\ndo so.\n\nWhile we believe that companies should\ngenerally set long-term targets for their\nenvironmental and social ambitions, we are\nmindful that not all compensation schemes lend\nthemselves to the inclusion of E&S metrics. We\nalso are of the view that companies should\nretain flexibility in not only choosing to\nincorporate E&S metrics in their compensation\nplans, but also in the placement of these\nmetrics. For example, some companies may\nresolve that including E&S criteria in the\nannual bonus may help to incentivize the\nachievement of short-term milestones and allow\nfor more maneuverability in strategic\nadjustments to long-term goals. Other\ncompanies may determine that their long-term\nsustainability targets are best achieved by\nincentivizing executives through metrics\nincluded in their long-term incentive plans.\n\nOne-TimeAwards\n\nGlass Lewis believes shareholders should\ngenerally be wary of awards granted outside of\nthe standard incentive schemes, as such awards\nhave the potential to undermine the integrity\nof a company\u0092s regular incentive plans or the\nlink between pay and performance, or both. We\ngenerally believe that if the existing\nincentive programs fail to provide adequate\nincentives to executives, companies should\nredesign their compensation programs rather\nthan make additional grants.\n\nHowever, Glass Lewis reviews grants of\nsupplemental awards on a case-by-case,\ncompany-by-companybasis to give adequate\nconsideration for unique circumstances.\nCompanies should provide a thorough\ndescription of the awards, including a cogent\nand convincing explanation of their necessity\nand why existing awards do not provide\nsufficient motivation and a discussion of how\nthe quantum of the award and its structure\nwere determined. Further, such awards should\nbe tied to future service and performance\nwhenever possible.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  47  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nAdditionally, we believe companies making\nsupplemental or one-timeawards should also\ndescribe if and how the regular compensation\narrangements will be affected by these\nadditional grants. In reviewing a company\u0092s\nuse of supplemental awards, Glass Lewis will\nevaluate the terms and size of the grants in\nthe context of the company\u0092s overall incentive\nstrategy and granting practices, as well as\nthe current operating environment.\n\nContractual Payments and Arrangements\n\nBeyond the quantum of contractual payments,\nGlass Lewis will also consider the design of\nany entitlements. Certain executive employment\nterms may help to drive a negative\nrecommendation, including, but not limited to:\n                                              \n      Excessively broad change in control     \n      triggers;                               \n                                              \n                                             \n      Inappropriate severance entitlements;  \n                                             \n                                              \n      Inadequately explained or excessive     \n      sign-on arrangements;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      Guaranteed bonuses (especially as a     \n      multiyear occurrence); and              \n                                              \n                                              \n      Failure to address any concerning       \n      practices in amended employment         \n      agreements.                             \n                                              \nIn general, we are wary of terms that are\nexcessively restrictive in favor of the\nexecutive, or that could potentially\nincentivize behaviors that are not in a\ncompany\u0092s best interest.\n\nSign-onAwards and Severance Benefits\n\nWe acknowledge that there may be certain costs\nassociated with transitions at the executive\nlevel. In evaluating the size of severance and\nsign-onarrangements, we may consider the\nexecutive\u0092s regular target compensation level,\nor the sums paid to other executives\n(including the recipient\u0092s predecessor, where\napplicable) in evaluating the appropriateness\nof such an arrangement.\n\nWe believe sign-onarrangements should be\nclearly disclosed and accompanied by a\nmeaningful explanation of the payments and the\nprocess by which the amounts were reached.\nFurther, the details of and basis for any\n\u0093make-whole\u0094 payments (paid as compensation\nfor awards forfeited from a previous employer)\nshould be provided.\n\nWith respect to severance, we believe\ncompanies should abide by predetermined\npayouts in most circumstances. While in\nlimited circumstances some deviations may not\nbe inappropriate, we believe shareholders\nshould be provided with a meaningful\nexplanation of any additional or increased\nbenefits agreed upon outside of regular\narrangements. However, where Glass Lewis\ndetermines that such predetermined payouts are\nparticularly problematic or unfavorable to\nshareholders, we may consider the execution of\nsuch payments in a negative recommendation for\nthe advisory vote on executive compensation.\n\nIn the U.S. market, most companies maintain\nseverance entitlements based on a multiple of\nsalary and, in many cases, bonus. In almost\nall instances we see, the relevant multiple is\nthree or less, even in the case of a change in\ncontrol. We believe the basis and total value\nof severance should be reasonable and should\nnot exceed the upper limit of general market\npractice. We consider the inclusion of long-\nterm incentives in cash severance calculations\nto be inappropriate, particularly given the\ncommonality of accelerated vesting and the\nproportional weight of long-term incentives as\na component of total pay. Additional\nconsiderations, however, will be accounted for\nwhen reviewing atypically structured\ncompensation approaches.\n\nChange in Control\n\nGlass Lewis considers double-trigger change in\ncontrol arrangements, which require both a\nchange in control and termination or\nconstructive termination, to be best practice.\nAny arrangement that is not explicitly double-\ntrigger may be considered a single-trigger or\nmodified single-trigger arrangement. Companies\nthat allow for\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  48  \n  States                                      \n                                              \ncommittee discretion over the treatment of\nunvested awards should commit to providing\nclear rationale for the committee\u0092s ultimate\ndecision as to how such awards should be\ntreated in the event a change in control\noccurs.\n\nFurther, we believe that excessively broad\ndefinitions of change in control are\npotentially problematic as they may lead to\nsituations where executives receive additional\ncompensation where no meaningful change in\nstatus or duties has occurred.\n\nExcise Tax Gross-ups\n\nAmong other entitlements, Glass Lewis is\nstrongly opposed to excise tax gross-\nupsrelated to IRC \u00a7 4999 and their expansion,\nespecially where no consideration is given to\nthe safe harbor limit. We believe that under\nno normal circumstance is the inclusion of\nexcise tax gross-upprovisions in new\nagreements or the addition of such provisions\nto amended agreements acceptable. In\nconsideration of the fact that minor increases\nin change-in-controlpayments can lead to\ndisproportionately large excise taxes, the\npotential negative impact of tax gross-upsfar\noutweighs any retentive benefit.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, the addition\nof new gross-upsaround this excise tax may\nlead to negative recommendations for a\ncompany\u0092s say-on-payproposal, the chair of the\ncompensation committee, or the entire\ncommittee, particularly in cases where a\ncompany had committed not to provide any such\nentitlements in the future. For situations in\nwhich the addition of new excise tax gross ups\nwill be provided in connection with a specific\nchange-in-controltransaction, this policy may\nbe applied to the say-on-payproposal, the\ngolden parachute proposal and recommendations\nrelated to the compensation committee for all\ninvolved corporate parties, as appropriate.\n\nAmended Employment Agreements\n\nAny contractual arrangements providing for\nproblematic pay practices which are not\naddressed in materially amended employment\nagreements will potentially be viewed by Glass\nLewis as a missed opportunity on the part of\nthe company to align its policies with current\nbest practices. Such problematic pay practices\ninclude, but are not limited to, excessive\nchange in control entitlements, modified\nsingle-trigger change in control entitlements,\nexcise tax gross-ups,and multi-year guaranteed\nawards.\n\nRecoupment Provisions (Clawbacks)\n\nOn October 26, 2022, the SEC adopted Rule\n10D-1under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934. The rule mandates national securities\nexchanges and associations to promulgate new\nlisting standards requiring companies to\nmaintain recoupment policies (\u0093clawback\nprovisions\u0094). The final clawback listing\nstandards were approved by the SEC, effective\nOctober 2, 2023 and required listed companies\nto adopt a compliant policy by December 1,\n2023. Glass Lewis believes that clawback\nprovisions play an important role in\nmitigating excessive risk-taking that may be\nencouraged by poorly structured variable\nincentive programs. Current listing standards\nrequire recoupment of erroneously awarded\npayouts to current and former executive\nofficers in the event of an accounting\nrestatement or correction to previous\nfinancial statements that is material to the\ncurrent period, regardless of fault or\nmisconduct.\n\nGlass Lewis recognizes that excessive risk-\ntaking that can materially and adversely\nimpact shareholders may not necessarily result\nin such restatements. We believe that clawback\npolicies should allow recovery from current\nand former executive officers in the event of\na restatement of financial results or similar\nrevision of performance indicators upon which\nthe awards were based. Additionally,\nrecoupment policies should provide companies\nwith the ability to claw back variable\nincentive payments (whether time-based or\nperformance-based) when there is evidence of\nproblematic decisions or actions, such as\nmaterial misconduct, a material reputational\nfailure, material risk management failure, or\na material operational failure, the\nconsequences of which have not already been\nreflected in incentive payments and where\nrecovery is warranted.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  49  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nIn situations where the company ultimately\ndetermines not to follow through with\nrecovery, Glass Lewis will assess the\nappropriateness of such determination for each\ncase. A thorough, detailed discussion of the\ncompany\u0092s decision to not pursue recoupment\nand, if applicable, how the company has\notherwise rectified the disconnect between\nexecutive pay outcomes and negative impacts of\ntheir actions on the company and the\nshareholder experience will be considered. The\nabsence of such enhanced disclosure may impact\nGlass Lewis\u0092 assessment of the quality of\ndisclosure and, in turn, may play a role in\nGlass Lewis\u0092 overall recommendation for the\nadvisory vote on executive compensation. The\nclawback policy should provide recoupment\nauthority regardless of whether the employment\nof the executive officer was terminated with\nor without cause.\n\nHedging of Stock\n\nGlass Lewis believes that the hedging of\nshares by executives in the shares of the\ncompanies where they are employed severs the\nalignment of interests of the executive with\nshareholders. We believe companies should\nadopt strict policies to prohibit executives\nfrom hedging the economic risk associated with\ntheir share ownership in the company.\n\nPledging of Stock\n\nGlass Lewis believes that shareholders should\nexamine the facts and circumstances of each\ncompany rather than apply a one-size-fits-\nallpolicy regarding employee stock pledging.\nGlass Lewis believes that shareholders benefit\nwhen employees, particularly senior\nexecutives, have meaningful financial interest\nin the success of the company under their\nmanagement, and therefore we recognize the\nbenefits of measures designed to encourage\nemployees to both buy shares out of their own\npocket and to retain shares they have been\ngranted; blanket policies prohibiting stock\npledging may discourage executives and\nemployees from doing either.\n\nHowever, we also recognize that the pledging\nof shares can present a risk that, depending\non a host of factors, an executive with\nsignificant pledged shares and limited other\nassets may have an incentive to take steps to\navoid a forced sale of shares in the face of a\nrapid stock price decline. Therefore, to avoid\nsubstantial losses from a forced sale to meet\nthe terms of the loan, the executive may have\nan incentive to boost the stock price in the\nshort term in a manner that is unsustainable,\nthus hurting shareholders in the long-term. We\nalso recognize concerns regarding pledging may\nnot apply to less senior employees, given the\nlatter group\u0092s significantly more limited\ninfluence over a company\u0092s stock price.\nTherefore, we believe that the issue of\npledging shares should be reviewed in that\ncontext, as should policies that distinguish\nbetween the two groups.\n\nGlass Lewis believes that the benefits of\nstock ownership by executives and employees\nmay outweigh the risks of stock pledging,\ndepending on many factors. As such, Glass\nLewis reviews all relevant factors in\nevaluating proposed policies, limitations and\nprohibitions on pledging stock, including:\n                                     \n      The number of shares pledged;  \n                                     \n                                              \n      The percentage executives\u0092 pledged       \n      shares are of outstanding shares;       \n                                              \n                                              \n      The percentage executives\u0092 pledged       \n      shares are of each executive\u0092s shares    \n      and total assets;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Whether the pledged shares were         \n      purchased by the employee or granted    \n      by the company;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Whether there are different policies    \n      for purchased and granted shares;       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Whether the granted shares were         \n      time-based or performance-based;        \n                                              \n                                              \n      The overall governance profile of the   \n      company;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      The volatility of the company\u0092s stock    \n      (in order to determine the likelihood   \n      of a sudden stock                       \n      price drop);                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      The nature and cyclicality, if          \n      applicable, of the company\u0092s industry;   \n                                              \n                                              \n      The participation and eligibility of    \n      executives and employees in pledging;   \n                                              \n                                              \n      The company\u0092s current policies           \n      regarding pledging and any waiver from  \n      these policies for                      \n      employees and executives; and           \n                                              \n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  50  \n  States                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      Disclosure of the extent of any         \n      pledging, particularly among senior     \n      executives.                             \n                                              \nExecutive Ownership Guidelines\n\nThe alignment between shareholder interests\nand those of executives helps to ensure that\nexecutives are acting in the best long-term\ninterests of disinterested shareholders.\nCompanies should facilitate this relationship\nthrough the adoption and enforcement of\nmeaningful minimum executive share ownership\nrequirements. Companies should clearly\ndisclose their executive ownership\nrequirements in their Compensation Discussion\nand Analysis section and how the various types\nof outstanding equity awards are counted or\nexcluded from the ownership level calculation.\n\nIn determining whether executives have met the\nrequirements or not, the inclusion of unearned\nperformance-based full value awards and/or\nunexercised stock options without cogent\nrationale may be viewed as problematic. While\nGlass Lewis views the inclusion of unearned\nperformance-based equity in the ownership\ndetermination renders executive share\nownership policies less effective, we continue\nto believe that performance-based equity\ncompensation plays an important role in the\nseparate issue of aligning executive pay with\nperformance.\n\nCompensation Consultant Independence\n\nAs mandated by Section 952 of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, as of January 11, 2013, the SEC approved\nlisting requirements for both the NYSE and\nNASDAQ which require compensation committees\nto consider six factors (https://www.sec.gov/r\nules/final/2012/33-9330.pdf, p.31-32)in\nassessing compensation advisor independence.\nAccording to the SEC, \u0093no one factor should be\nviewed as a determinative factor.\u0094 Glass Lewis\nbelieves this six-factorassessment is an\nimportant process for every compensation\ncommittee to undertake but believes companies\nemploying a consultant for board compensation,\nconsulting and other corporate services should\nprovide clear disclosure beyond just a\nreference to examining the six points, in\norder to allow shareholders to review the\nspecific aspects of the various consultant\nrelationships.\n\nWe believe compensation consultants are\nengaged to provide objective, disinterested,\nexpert advice to the compensation committee.\nWhen the consultant or its affiliates receive\nsubstantial income from providing other\nservices to the company, we believe the\npotential for a conflict of interest arises\nand the independence of the consultant may be\njeopardized. Therefore, Glass Lewis will, when\nrelevant, note the potential for a conflict of\ninterest when the fees paid to the advisor or\nits affiliates for other services exceed those\npaid for compensation consulting.\n\nCEO Pay Ratio\n\nAs mandated by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Consumer and Protection Act,\nbeginning in 2018, issuers will be required to\ndisclose the median annual total compensation\nof all employees except the CEO, the total\nannual compensation of the CEO or equivalent\nposition, and the ratio between the two\namounts. Glass Lewis will display the pay\nratio as a data point in our Proxy Papers, as\navailable. While we recognize that the pay\nratio has the potential to provide additional\ninsight when assessing a company\u0092s pay\npractices, at this time it will not be a\ndeterminative factor in our voting\nrecommendations. On the other hand, we believe\nthe underlying data may help shareholders\nevaluate the rationale for certain executive\npay decisions such as increases in fixed pay\nlevels.\n\nFrequency of Say-on-Pay\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also requires companies to\nallow shareholders a non-bindingvote on the\nfrequency of say-on-payvotes (i.e., every one,\ntwo or three years). Additionally, Dodd-Frank\nrequires companies to hold such votes on the\nfrequency of say-on-payvotes at least once\nevery six years.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  51  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nWe believe companies should submit say-on-\npayvotes to shareholders every year. We\nbelieve that the time and financial burdens to\na company with regard to an annual vote are\nrelatively small and incremental and are\noutweighed by the benefits to shareholders\nthrough more frequent accountability.\nImplementing biannual or triennial votes on\nexecutive compensation limits shareholders\u0092\nability to hold the board accountable for its\ncompensation practices through means other\nthan voting against the compensation\ncommittee. Unless a company provides a\ncompelling rationale or unique circumstances\nfor say-on-payvotes less frequent than\nannually, we will generally recommend that\nshareholders support annual votes on\ncompensation.\n\nVote on Golden Parachute Arrangements\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also requires companies to\nprovide shareholders with a separate non-\nbindingvote on approval of golden parachute\ncompensation arrangements in connection with\ncertain change-in-controltransactions.\nHowever, if the golden parachute arrangements\nhave previously been subject to a say-on-\npayvote which shareholders approved, then this\nrequired vote is waived.\n\nGlass Lewis believes the narrative and tabular\ndisclosure of golden parachute arrangements\nbenefits all shareholders. Glass Lewis\nanalyzes each golden parachute arrangement on\na case-by-casebasis, taking into account,\namong other items: the nature of the change-\nin-controltransaction, the ultimate value of\nthe payments particularly compared to the\nvalue of the transaction, any excise tax\ngross-upobligations, the tenure and position\nof the executives in question before and after\nthe transaction, any new or amended employment\nagreements entered into in connection with the\ntransaction, and the type of triggers involved\n(i.e., single vs. double). In cases where new\nproblematic features, such as excise tax\ngross-upobligations or new and excessive\nsingle-trigger entitlements, are introduced in\na golden parachute proposal, such features may\ncontribute to a negative recommendation not\nonly for the golden parachute proposal under\nreview, but for the next say-on-payproposal of\nany involved corporate parties, as well as\nrecommendations against their compensation\ncommittee as appropriate.\n\nEquity-Based Compensation Proposals\n\nWe believe that equity compensation awards,\nwhen not abused, are useful for retaining\nemployees and providing an incentive for them\nto act in a way that will improve company\nperformance. Glass Lewis recognizes that\nequity-based compensation plans are critical\ncomponents of a company\u0092s overall compensation\nprogram, and we analyze such plans accordingly\nbased on both quantitative and qualitative\nfactors.\n\nOur quantitative analysis assesses the plan\u0092s\ncost and the company\u0092s pace of granting\nutilizing a number of different analyses,\ncomparing the program with absolute limits we\nbelieve are key to equity value creation and\nwith a carefully chosen peer group. In\ngeneral, our model seeks to determine whether\nthe proposed plan is either absolutely\nexcessive or is more than one standard\ndeviation away from the average plan for the\npeer group on a range of criteria, including\ndilution to shareholders and the projected\nannual cost relative to the company\u0092s\nfinancial performance. Each of the analyses\n(and their constituent parts) is weighted and\nthe plan is scored in accordance with that\nweight.\n\nWe compare the program\u0092s expected annual\nexpense with the business\u0092s operating metrics\nto help determine whether the plan is\nexcessive in light of company performance. We\nalso compare the plan\u0092s expected annual cost\nto the enterprise value of the firm rather\nthan to market capitalization because the\nemployees, managers and directors of the firm\ncontribute to the creation of enterprise value\nbut not necessarily market capitalization (the\nbiggest difference is seen where cash\nrepresents the vast majority of market\ncapitalization). Finally, we do not rely\nexclusively on relative comparisons with\naverages because, in addition to creeping\naverages serving to inflate compensation, we\nbelieve that some absolute limits are\nwarranted.\n\nWe then consider qualitative aspects of the\nplan such as plan administration, the method\nand terms of exercise, repricing history,\nexpress or implied rights to reprice, and the\npresence of evergreen provisions.

A\nrequired abstention vote or non-votefrom the\nrecipient for an equity award proposal in\nthese situations can help to avoid such\nconflicts. This favorable feature will be\nweighed alongside the structure, disclosure,\ndilution, provided rationale, and other\nprovisions related to the individual award to\nassess the award\u0092s alignment with long-term\nshareholder interests.\n\nOption Exchanges and Repricing\n\nGlass Lewis is generally opposed to the\nrepricing of employee and director options\nregardless of how it is accomplished.\nEmployees should have some downside risk in\ntheir equity-based compensation program and\nrepricing eliminates any such risk. As\nshareholders have substantial risk in owning\nstock, we believe that the equity compensation\nof employees and directors should be similarly\nsituated to align their interests with those\nof shareholders. We believe this will\nfacilitate appropriate risk- and opportunity-\ntaking for the company by employees.\n\nWe are concerned that option grantees who\nbelieve they will be \u0093rescued\u0094 from underwater\noptions will be more inclined to take\nunjustifiable risks. Moreover, a predictable\npattern of repricing or exchanges\nsubstantially alters a stock option\u0092s value\nbecause options that will practically never\nexpire deeply out of the money are worth far\nmore than options that carry a risk of\nexpiration.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  53  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nIn short, repricings and option exchange\nprograms change the bargain between\nshareholders and employees after the bargain\nhas been struck.\n\nThere is one circumstance in which a repricing\nor option exchange program may be acceptable:\nif macroeconomic or industry trends, rather\nthan specific company issues, cause a stock\u0092s\nvalue to decline dramatically and the\nrepricing is necessary to motivate and retain\nemployees. In viewing the company\u0092s stock\ndecline as part of a larger trend, we would\nexpect the impact to approximately reflect the\nmarket or industry price decline in terms of\ntiming and magnitude. In this circumstance, we\nthink it fair to conclude that option grantees\nmay be suffering from a risk that was not\nforeseeable when the original \u0093bargain\u0094 was\nstruck. In such a scenario, we may opt to\nsupport a repricing or option exchange program\nonly if sufficient conditions are met. We look\nfor the following features in a repricing or\nexchange proposal:\n                                              \n      Officers and board members cannot       \n      participate in the program; and         \n                                              \n                                              \n      The exchange is value-neutral or        \n      value-creative to shareholders using    \n      very conservative assumptions.          \n                                              \nIn our evaluation of the appropriateness of\nthe program design, we also consider the\ninclusion of the following features:\n                                              \n      The vesting requirements on exchanged   \n      or repriced options are extended        \n      beyond one year;                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      Shares reserved for options that are    \n      reacquired in an option exchange will   \n      permanently retire (i.e.,               \n      will not be available for future        \n      grants) so as to prevent additional     \n      shareholder dilution in the future;     \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      Management and the board make a cogent  \n      case for needing to motivate and        \n      retain existing employees,              \n      such as being in a competitive          \n      employment market.                      \n                                              \nOption Backdating, Spring-Loading and Bullet-\nDodging\n\nGlass Lewis views option backdating, and the\nrelated practices of spring-loading and\nbullet-dodging, as egregious actions that\nwarrant holding the appropriate management and\nboard members responsible. These practices are\nsimilar to repricing options and eliminate\nmuch of the downside risk inherent in an\noption grant that is designed to induce\nrecipients to maximize shareholder return.\n\nBackdating an option is the act of changing an\noption\u0092s grant date from the actual grant date\nto an earlier date when the market price of\nthe underlying stock was lower, resulting in a\nlower exercise price for the option. In past\nstudies, Glass Lewis identified over 270\ncompanies that have disclosed internal or\ngovernment investigations into their past\nstock-option grants.\n\nSpring-loading is granting stock options while\nin possession of material, positive\ninformation that has not been disclosed\npublicly. Bullet-dodging is delaying the\ngrants of stock options until after the\nrelease of material, negative information.\nThis can allow option grants to be made at a\nlower price either before the release of\npositive news or following the release of\nnegative news, assuming the stock\u0092s price will\nmove up or down in response to the\ninformation. This raises a concern similar to\nthat of insider trading, or the trading on\nmaterial non-publicinformation.\n\nThe exercise price for an option is determined\non the day of grant, providing the recipient\nwith the same market risk as an investor who\nbought shares on that date. However, where\noptions were backdated, the executive or the\nboard (or the compensation committee) changed\nthe grant date retroactively. The new date may\nbe at or near the lowest price for the year or\nperiod. This would be like allowing an\ninvestor to look back and select the lowest\nprice of the year at which to buy shares.\n\nA 2006 study of option grants made between\n1996 and 2005 at 8,000 companies found that\noption backdating can be an indication of poor\ninternal controls. The study found that option\nbackdating was more likely to occur at\ncompanies without a majority independent board\nand with a long-serving CEO; both factors, the\nstudy\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  54  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nconcluded, were associated with greater CEO\ninfluence on the company\u0092s compensation and\ngovernance practices. 43\n\nWhere a company granted backdated options to\nan executive who is also a director, Glass\nLewis will recommend voting against that\nexecutive/director, regardless of who decided\nto make the award. In addition, Glass Lewis\nwill recommend voting against those directors\nwho either approved or allowed the backdating.\nGlass Lewis feels that executives and\ndirectors who either benefited from backdated\noptions or authorized the practice have failed\nto act in the best interests of shareholders.\n\nGiven the severe tax and legal liabilities to\nthe company from backdating, Glass Lewis will\nconsider recommending voting against members\nof the audit committee who served when options\nwere backdated, a restatement occurs, material\nweaknesses in internal controls exist and\ndisclosures indicate there was a lack of\ndocumentation. These committee members failed\nin their responsibility to ensure the\nintegrity of the company\u0092s financial reports.\n\nWhen a company has engaged in spring-loading\nor bullet-dodging, Glass Lewis will consider\nrecommending voting against the compensation\ncommittee members where there has been a\npattern of granting options at or near\nhistoric lows. Glass Lewis will also recommend\nvoting against executives serving on the board\nwho benefited from the spring-loading or\nbullet-dodging.\n\nDirector Compensation Plans\n\nGlass Lewis believes that non-\nemployeedirectors should receive reasonable\nand appropriate compensation for the time and\neffort they spend serving on the board and its\ncommittees. However, a balance is required.\nFees should be competitive in order to retain\nand attract qualified individuals, but\nexcessive fees represent a financial cost to\nthe company and potentially compromise the\nobjectivity and independence of non-\nemployeedirectors. We will consider\nrecommending support for compensation plans\nthat include option grants or other equity-\nbased awards that help to align the interests\nof outside directors with those of\nshareholders. However, to ensure directors are\nnot incentivized in the same manner as\nexecutives but rather serve as a check on\nimprudent risk-taking in executive\ncompensation plan design, equity grants to\ndirectors should not be performance-based.\nWhere an equity plan exclusively or primarily\ncovers non-employeedirectors as participants,\nwe do not believe that the plan should provide\nfor performance-based awards in any capacity.\n\nWhen non-employeedirector equity grants are\ncovered by the same equity plan that applies\nto a company\u0092s broader employee base, we will\nuse our proprietary model and analyst review\nof this model to guide our voting\nrecommendations. If such a plan broadly allows\nfor performance-based awards to directors or\nexplicitly provides for such grants, we may\nrecommend against the overall plan on this\nbasis, particularly if the company has granted\nperformance-based awards to directors in past.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plans\n\nGlass Lewis believes that employee stock\npurchase plans (ESPPs) can provide employees\nwith a sense of ownership in their company and\nhelp strengthen the alignment between the\ninterests of employees and shareholders. We\nevaluate ESPPs by assessing the expected\ndiscount, purchase period, expected purchase\nactivity (if previous activity has been\ndisclosed) and whether the plan has a\n\u0093lookback\u0094 feature. Except for the most\nextreme cases, Glass Lewis will generally\nsupport these plans given the regulatory\npurchase limit of $25,000 per employee per\nyear, which we believe is reasonable. We also\nlook at the number of shares requested to see\nif a ESPP will significantly contribute to\noverall shareholder dilution or if\nshareholders will not have a chance to approve\nthe program for an excessive period of time.\nAs such, we will generally recommend against\nESPPs that contain \u0093evergreen\u0094 provisions that\nautomatically increase the number of shares\navailable under the ESPP each year.\n\n43Lucian Bebchuk, Yaniv Grinstein and Urs\nPeyer. \u0093LUCKY CEOs.\u0094 November, 2006.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  55  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nExecutive Compensation Tax Deductibility \u0097\nAmendment to IRC 162(M)\n\nThe \u0093Tax Cut and Jobs Act\u0094 had significant\nimplications on Section 162(m) of the Internal\nRevenue Code, a provision that allowed\ncompanies to deduct compensation in excess of\n$1 million for the CEO and the next three most\nhighly compensated executive officers,\nexcluding the CFO, if the compensation is\nperformance-based and is paid under\nshareholder-approved plans. Glass Lewis does\nnot generally view amendments to equity plans\nand changes to compensation programs in\nresponse to the elimination of tax deductions\nunder 162(m) as problematic. This specifically\nholds true if such modifications contribute to\nthe maintenance of a sound performance-based\ncompensation program.\n\nAs grandfathered contracts may continue to be\neligible for tax deductions under the\ntransition rule for Section 162(m), companies\nmay therefore submit incentive plans for\nshareholder approval to take of advantage of\nthe tax deductibility afforded under 162(m)\nfor certain types of compensation.\n\nWe believe the best practice for companies is\nto provide robust disclosure to shareholders\nso that they can make fully informed judgments\nabout the reasonableness of the proposed\ncompensation plan. To allow for meaningful\nshareholder review, we prefer that disclosure\nshould include specific performance metrics, a\nmaximum award pool, and a maximum award amount\nper employee. We also believe it is important\nto analyze the estimated grants to see if they\nare reasonable and in line with the company\u0092s\npeers.\n\nWe typically recommend voting against a 162(m)\nproposal where: (i) a company fails to provide\nat least a list of performance targets; (ii) a\ncompany fails to provide one of either a total\nmaximum or an individual maximum; or (iii) the\nproposed plan or individual maximum award\nlimit is excessive when compared with the\nplans of the company\u0092s peers.\n\nThe company\u0092s record of aligning pay with\nperformance (as evaluated using our\nproprietary pay-for-performancemodel) also\nplays a role in our recommendation. Where a\ncompany has a record of setting reasonable pay\nrelative to business performance, we generally\nrecommend voting in favor of a plan even if\nthe plan caps seem large relative to peers\nbecause we recognize the value in special pay\narrangements for continued exceptional\nperformance.\n\nAs with all other issues we review, our goal\nis to provide consistent but contextual advice\ngiven the specifics of the company and ongoing\nperformance. Overall, we recognize that it is\ngenerally not in shareholders\u0092 best interests\nto vote against such a plan and forgo the\npotential tax benefit since shareholder\nrejection of such plans will not curtail the\nawards; it will only prevent the tax deduction\nassociated with them.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  56  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nGovernance Structure and the Shareholder\nFranchise\n\nAnti-Takeover Measures\n\nPoison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plans)\n\nGlass Lewis believes that poison pill plans\nare not generally in shareholders\u0092 best\ninterests. They can reduce management\naccountability by substantially limiting\nopportunities for corporate takeovers. Rights\nplans can thus prevent shareholders from\nreceiving a buy-outpremium for their stock.\nTypically we recommend that shareholders vote\nagainst these plans to protect their financial\ninterests and ensure that they have an\nopportunity to consider any offer for their\nshares, especially those at a premium.\n\nWe believe boards should be given wide\nlatitude in directing company activities and\nin charting the company\u0092s course. However, on\nan issue such as this, where the link between\nthe shareholders\u0092 financial interests and\ntheir right to consider and accept buyout\noffers is substantial, we believe that\nshareholders should be allowed to vote on\nwhether they support such a plan\u0092s\nimplementation. This issue is different from\nother matters that are typically left to board\ndiscretion. Its potential impact on and\nrelation to shareholders is direct and\nsubstantial. It is also an issue in which\nmanagement interests may be different from\nthose of shareholders; thus, ensuring that\nshareholders have a voice is the only way to\nsafeguard their interests.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we will support a\npoison pill that is limited in scope to\naccomplish a particular objective, such as the\nclosing of an important merger, or a pill that\ncontains what we believe to be a reasonable\nqualifying offer clause. We will consider\nsupporting a poison pill plan if the\nqualifying offer clause includes each of the\nfollowing attributes:\n                                              \n      The form of offer is not required to    \n      be an all-cash                          \n      transaction;                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      The offer is not required to remain     \n      open for more than 90 business days;    \n                                              \n                                              \n      The offeror is permitted to amend the   \n      offer, reduce the offer, or otherwise   \n      change the terms;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      There is no fairness opinion            \n      requirement; and                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      There is a low to no premium            \n      requirement.                            \n                                              \nWhere these requirements are met, we typically\nfeel comfortable that shareholders will have\nthe opportunity to voice their opinion on any\nlegitimate offer.\n\nNOL Poison Pills\n\nSimilarly, Glass Lewis may consider supporting\na limited poison pill in the event that a\ncompany seeks shareholder approval of a rights\nplan for the express purpose of preserving Net\nOperating Losses (NOLs). While companies with\nNOLs can generally carry these losses forward\nto offset future taxable income, Section 382\nof the Internal Revenue Code limits companies\u0092\nability to use NOLs in the event of a \u0093change\nof ownership.\u0094 44In this case, a company may\nadopt or amend a poison pill (NOL pill) in\norder to prevent an inadvertent change of\nownership by multiple investors purchasing\nsmall chunks of stock at the same time, and\nthereby preserve the\n\n44Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code\nrefers to a \u0093change of ownership\u0094 of more than\n50 percentage points by one or more 5%\nshareholders within a three-year period. The\nstatute is intended to deter the \u0093trafficking\u0094\nof net operating losses.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  57  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nability to carry the NOLs forward. Often such\nNOL pills have trigger thresholds much lower\nthan the common 15% or 20% thresholds, with\nsome NOL pill triggers as low as 5%.\n\nIn many cases, companies will propose the\nadoption of bylaw amendments specifically\nrestricting certain share transfers, in\naddition to proposing the adoption of a NOL\npill. In general, if we support the terms of a\nparticular NOL pill, we will generally support\nthe additional protective amendment in the\nabsence of significant concerns with the\nspecific terms of that proposal.\n\nAs with traditional poison pills, NOL pills\nmay deter shareholders and potentially serve\nas entrenchment mechanisms. Certain features\nsuch as low thresholds combined with acting in\nconcert provisions, among other concerning\nterms, may disempower shareholders and\ninsulate the board and management. When acting\nin concert provisions are present within the\nterms of a NOL pill, we believe this may raise\nconcerns as to the true objective of the pill.\n\nActing in concert provisions broaden the\ndefinition of beneficial ownership to prohibit\nparallel conduct, or multiple shareholders\nparty to a formal or informal agreement\ncollaborating to influence the board and\nmanagement of a company, and aggregate the\nownership of such shareholders towards the\ntriggering threshold. In our view, acting in\nconcert provisions broadly limit the voice of\nshareholders and may diminish their ability to\nengage in a productive dialogue with the\ncompany and with other shareholders. When a\nboard adopts defensive measures without\nengaging with shareholders, we take a dim view\nof the board and the overall governance of the\ncompany.\n\nAs such, Glass Lewis evaluates NOL pills on a\nstrictly case-by-casebasis, taking into\nconsideration, among other factors: (i) the\nvalue of the NOLs to the company; (ii) the\nlikelihood of a change of ownership based on\nthe size of the holdings and the nature of the\nlarger shareholders; (iii) the trigger\nthreshold; (iv) the duration of the plan\n(i.e., whether it contains a reasonable\n\u0093sunset\u0094 provision, generally one year or\nless); (v) the inclusion of an acting in\nconcert provision; (vi) whether the pill is\nimplemented following the filing of a Schedule\n13D by a shareholder or there is evidence of\nhostile activity or shareholder activism; and\n(vii) if the pill is subject to periodic board\nreview and/or shareholder ratification.\n\nWe believe that shareholders should be offered\nthe opportunity to vote on any adoption or\nrenewal of a NOL pill regardless of any\npotential tax benefit that it offers a\ncompany. As such, we will consider\nrecommending voting against those members of\nthe board who served at the time when an NOL\npill was adopted without shareholder approval\nwithin the prior twelve months and where the\nNOL pill is not subject to shareholder\nratification.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nFair price provisions, which are rare, require\nthat certain minimum price and procedural\nrequirements be observed by any party that\nacquires more than a specified percentage of a\ncorporation\u0092s common stock. The provision is\nintended to protect minority shareholder value\nwhen an acquirer seeks to accomplish a merger\nor other transaction which would eliminate or\nchange the interests of the minority\nshareholders. The provision is generally\napplied against the acquirer unless the\ntakeover is approved by a majority of\n\u0093continuing directors\u0094 and holders of a\nmajority, in some cases a supermajority as\nhigh as 80%, of the combined voting power of\nall stock entitled to vote to alter, amend, or\nrepeal the above provisions.\n\nThe effect of a fair price provision is to\nrequire approval of any merger or business\ncombination with an \u0093interested shareholder\u0094\nby 51% of the voting stock of the company,\nexcluding the shares held by the interested\nshareholder. An interested shareholder is\ngenerally considered to be a holder of 10% or\nmore of the company\u0092s outstanding stock, but\nthe trigger can vary.\n\nGenerally, provisions are put in place for the\nostensible purpose of preventing a back-\nendmerger where the interested shareholder\nwould be able to pay a lower price for the\nremaining shares of the company than he or\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  58  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nshe paid to gain control. The effect of a fair\nprice provision on shareholders, however, is\nto limit their ability to gain a premium for\ntheir shares through a partial tender offer or\nopen market acquisition which typically raise\nthe share price, often significantly. A fair\nprice provision discourages such transactions\nbecause of the potential costs of seeking\nshareholder approval and because of the\nrestrictions on purchase price for completing\na merger or other transaction at a later time.\n\nGlass Lewis believes that fair price\nprovisions, while sometimes protecting\nshareholders from abuse in a takeover\nsituation, more often act as an impediment to\ntakeovers, potentially limiting gains to\nshareholders from a variety of transactions\nthat could significantly increase share price.\nIn some cases, even the independent directors\nof the board cannot make exceptions when such\nexceptions may be in the best interests of\nshareholders. Given the existence of state law\nprotections for minority shareholders such as\nSection 203 of the Delaware Corporations Code,\nwe believe it is in the best interests of\nshareholders to remove fair price provisions.\n\nControl Share Statutes\n\nCertain states, including Delaware, have\nadopted control share acquisition statutes as\nan anti-takeover defense for certain closed-\nendinvestment companies and business\ndevelopment companies. Control share statutes\nmay prevent changes in control by limiting\nvoting rights of a person that acquires the\nownership of \u0093control shares.\u0094 Control shares\nare shares of stock equal to or exceeding\nspecified percentages of company voting power,\nand a control share statute prevents shares in\nexcess of the specified percentage from being\nvoted, unless: (i) the board approves them to\nbe voted; or (ii) the holder of the \u0093control\nshares\u0094 receives approval from a supermajority\nof \u0093non-interested\u0094shareholders.\n\nDepending on the state of incorporation,\ncompanies may automatically rely on control\nshare statutes unless the fund\u0092s board of\ntrustees eliminates the application of the\ncontrol share statute to any or all fund share\nacquisitions, through adoption of a provision\nin the fund\u0092s governing instrument or by fund\nboard action alone. In certain other states,\ncompanies must adopt control share statutes.\n\nIn our view, control share statues\ndisenfranchise shareholders by reducing their\nvoting power to a level less than their\neconomic interest and effectively function as\nan anti-takeover device. We believe all\nshareholders should have an opportunity to\nvote all of their shares. Moreover, anti-\ntakeover measures may prevent shareholders\nfrom receiving a buy-outpremium for their\nstock.\n\nAs such, we will generally recommend voting\nfor proposals to opt out of control share\nacquisition statutes, unless doing so would\nallow the completion of a takeover that is not\nin the best interests of shareholders; and\nagainst proposals to amend the charter to\ninclude control share acquisition provisions.\n\nFurther, in cases where a closed-endfund or\nbusiness development company has received a\npublic buyout offer and has relied on a\ncontrol share statute as a defense mechanism\nin the prior year, we will generally recommend\nshareholders vote against the chair of the\nnominating and governance committee, absent a\ncompelling rationale as to why a rejected\nacquisition was not in the best interests of\nshareholders.\n\nQuorum Requirements\n\nGlass Lewis believes that a company\u0092s quorum\nrequirement should be set at a level high\nenough to ensure that a broad range of\nshareholders are represented in person or by\nproxy, but low enough that the company can\ntransact necessary business. Companies in the\nU.S. are generally subject to quorum\nrequirements under the laws of their specific\nstate of incorporation. Additionally, those\ncompanies listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market\nare required to specify a quorum in their\nbylaws, provided however that such quorum may\nnot be less than one-thirdof outstanding\nshares. Prior to 2013, the New York Stock\nExchange required a quorum of 50% for listed\ncompanies, although this requirement was\ndropped in recognition of individual state\nrequirements and\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  59  \n  States                                      \n                                              \npotential confusion for issuers. Delaware, for\nexample, required companies to provide for a\nquorum of no less than one-thirdof outstanding\nshares; otherwise such quorum shall default to\na majority.\n\nWe generally believe a majority of outstanding\nshares entitled to vote is an appropriate\nquorum for the transaction of business at\nshareholder meetings. However, should a\ncompany seek shareholder approval of a lower\nquorum requirement we will generally support a\nreduced quorum of at least one-thirdof shares\nentitled to vote, either in person or by\nproxy. When evaluating such proposals, we also\nconsider the specific facts and circumstances\nof the company, such as size and shareholder\nbase.\n\nDirector and Officer Indemnification\n\nWhile Glass Lewis strongly believes that\ndirectors and officers should be held to the\nhighest standard when carrying out their\nduties to shareholders, some protection from\nliability is reasonable to protect them\nagainst certain suits so that these officers\nfeel comfortable taking measured risks that\nmay benefit shareholders. As such, we find it\nappropriate for a company to provide\nindemnification and/or enroll in liability\ninsurance to cover its directors and officers\nso long as the terms of such agreements are\nreasonable.\n\nOfficer Exculpation\n\nIn August 2022, the Delaware General Assembly\namended Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law (\u0093DGCL\u0094) to authorize\ncorporations to adopt a provision in their\ncertificate of incorporation to eliminate or\nlimit monetary liability of certain corporate\nofficers for breach of fiduciary duty of care.\nPreviously, the DGCL allowed only exculpation\nof corporate directors from breach of\nfiduciary duty of care claims if the\ncorporation\u0092s certificate of incorporation\nincludes an exculpation provision.\n\nThe amendment authorizes corporations to\nprovide for exculpation of the following\nofficers: (i) the corporation\u0092s president,\nchief executive officer, chief operating\nofficer, chief financial officer, chief legal\nofficer, controller, treasurer or chief\naccounting officer, (ii) \u0093named executive\nofficers\u0094 identified in the corporation\u0092s SEC\nfilings, and (iii) individuals who have agreed\nto be identified as officers of the\ncorporation.\n\nCorporate exculpation provisions under the\nDGCL only apply to claims for breach of the\nduty of care, and not to breaches of the duty\nof loyalty. Exculpation provisions also do not\napply to acts or omissions not in good faith\nor that involve intentional misconduct,\nknowing violations of the law, or transactions\ninvolving the receipt of any improper personal\nbenefits. Furthermore, officers may not be\nexculpated from claims brought against them\nby, or in the right of, the corporation (i.e.,\nderivative actions).\n\nUnder Section 102(b)(7), a corporation must\naffirmatively elect to include an exculpation\nprovision in its certificate of incorporation.\nWe will closely evaluate proposals to adopt\nofficer exculpation provisions on a case-by-\ncasebasis. We will generally recommend voting\nagainst such proposals eliminating monetary\nliability for breaches of the duty of care for\ncertain corporate officers, unless compelling\nrationale for the adoption is provided by the\nboard, and the provisions are reasonable.\n\nReincorporation\n\nIn general, Glass Lewis believes that the\nboard is in the best position to determine the\nappropriate jurisdiction of incorporation for\nthe company. We review all proposals to\nreincorporate to a different state or country\non a case-by-casebasis. Our review includes\nthe changes in corporate governance\nprovisions, especially those relating to\nshareholder rights, material differences in\ncorporate statutes and legal precedents, and\nrelevant financial benefits, among other\nfactors, resulting from the change in\ndomicile.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  60  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nGlass Lewis closely examines the impact on\nshareholder rights arising from a change in\ndomicile and governing law, including the\nfollowing:\n                                              \n      Will shareholders gain/retain certain   \n      rights (i.e. the right to call special  \n      meetings, the right to                  \n      act by written consent, the ability to  \n      remove directors)?                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      Does the proposed new jurisdiction      \n      allow for director and officer          \n      exculpation and/or exclusive forum      \n      provisions?                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      What are the fiduciary duties (if any)  \n      of directors, officers, and majority    \n      shareholders under the                  \n      new jurisdiction\u0092s statutes?             \n                                              \n                                              \n      What are the material differences in    \n      corporate statutes, case law, and       \n      judicial systems?                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Is the company proposing to             \n      reincorporate to a jurisdiction         \n      considered to be a \u0093tax haven\u0094?           \n                                              \nIn addition, when examining a proposal to\nreincorporate, we will also consider the\noverall governance of the company, including,\nbut not limited to, the following:\n                                              \n      Does the company have anti-takeover     \n      protections such as a poison pill or    \n      classified board in place?              \n                                              \n                                              \n      Does the company have a significant     \n      shareholder or is the company           \n      otherwise considered controlled?45      \n                                              \n                                              \n      Has the board been previously           \n      unresponsive to shareholders (such as   \n      failing to implement a                  \n      shareholder proposal that received      \n      majority shareholder support)?          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Does the company have an independent    \n      chair and is the board sufficiently     \n      independent?                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Are there other material governance     \n      issues of concern at the company? Has   \n      the company\u0092s                            \n      performance matched or exceeded its     \n      peers in the past one and three years?  \n                                              \n                                              \n      How has the company ranked in Glass     \n      Lewis\u0092 pay-for-performance analysis      \n      during the last three years?            \n                                              \nWhere there is a decline in shareholder\nrights, the financial benefits are de minimis,\nand the proposed jurisdiction has\nsignificantly worse shareholder protections,\nwe will generally recommend voting against the\ntransaction.\n\nIn addition, costly, shareholder-initiated\nreincorporations are typically not the best\nroute to achieve the furtherance of\nshareholder rights. We believe shareholders\nare generally better served by proposing\nspecific shareholder resolutions addressing\npertinent issues which may be implemented at a\nlower cost, and perhaps even with board\napproval. However, when shareholders propose a\nshift into a jurisdiction with enhanced\nshareholder rights, Glass Lewis examines the\nsignificant ways the company would benefit\nfrom shifting jurisdictions including an\nevaluation of the criteria listed above. We\nnote, however, that we will only support\nshareholder proposals to change a company\u0092s\nplace of incorporation in exceptional\ncircumstances.\n\nExclusive Forum and Fee-ShiftingBylaw\nProvisions\n\nGlass Lewis recognizes that companies may be\nsubject to frivolous and opportunistic\nlawsuits, particularly in conjunction with a\nmerger or acquisition, that are expensive and\ndistracting. In response, companies have\nsought ways to prevent or limit the risk of\nsuch suits by adopting bylaws regarding where\nthe suits must be brought or shifting the\nburden of the legal expenses to the plaintiff,\nif unsuccessful at trial.\n\nGlass Lewis believes that charter or bylaw\nprovisions limiting a shareholder\u0092s choice of\nlegal venue are not in the best interests of\nshareholders. Such clauses may effectively\ndiscourage the use of shareholder claims by\nincreasing their associated costs and making\nthem more difficult to pursue. As such,\nshareholders should be wary about approving\nany limitation on their legal recourse\nincluding limiting themselves to a single\njurisdiction (e.g., Delaware or federal courts\nfor matters arising under the Securities Act\nof 1933) without compelling evidence that it\nwill benefit shareholders.\n\n45In cases where a controlled company is\nseeking to change its domicile, we will\nclosely evaluate how the independent members\nof the board came to its recommendation, if\nthe controlling shareholder had any ability to\ninfluence the board, and if the proposal is\nalso put to a vote of disinterested\nshareholders.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  61  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nFor this reason, we recommend that\nshareholders vote against any bylaw or charter\namendment seeking to adopt an exclusive forum\nprovision unless the company: (i) provides a\ncompelling argument on why the provision would\ndirectly benefit shareholders; (ii) provides\nevidence of abuse of legal process in other,\nnon-favoredjurisdictions; (iii) narrowly\ntailors such provision to the risks involved;\nand (iv) maintains a strong record of good\ncorporate governance practices.\n\nMoreover, in the event a board seeks\nshareholder approval of a forum selection\nclause pursuant to a bundled bylaw amendment\nrather than as a separate proposal, we will\nweigh the importance of the other bundled\nprovisions when determining the vote\nrecommendation on the proposal. We will\nnonetheless recommend voting against the chair\nof the governance committee for bundling\ndisparate proposals into a single proposal\n(refer to our discussion of nominating and\ngovernance committee performance in Section I\nof the guidelines).\n\nSimilarly, some companies have adopted bylaws\nrequiring plaintiffs who sue the company and\nfail to receive a judgment in their favor pay\nthe legal expenses of the company. These\nbylaws, also known as \u0093fee-shifting\u0094or \u0093loser\npays\u0094 bylaws, will likely have a chilling\neffect on even meritorious shareholder\nlawsuits as shareholders would face an strong\nfinancial disincentive not to sue a company.\nGlass Lewis therefore strongly opposes the\nadoption of such fee-shiftingbylaws and, if\nadopted without shareholder approval, will\nrecommend voting against the governance\ncommittee. While we note that in June of 2015\nthe State of Delaware banned the adoption of\nfee-shiftingbylaws, such provisions could\nstill be adopted by companies incorporated in\nother states.\n\nAuthorized Shares\n\nGlass Lewis believes that adequate capital\nstock is important to a company\u0092s operation.\nWhen analyzing a request for additional\nshares, we typically review four common\nreasons why a company might need additional\ncapital stock:\n                                              \n        Stock Split \u0097 We typically consider    \n        three metrics when evaluating         \n        whether we think a stock split is     \n        likely or necessary: The historical   \n        stock                                 \n        pre-split price, if any; the current  \n        price relative to the company\u0092s most   \n  1.    common trading price over the past    \n        52 weeks; and some absolute limits    \n        on stock price that, in our view,     \n        either always make a stock            \n        split appropriate if desired by       \n        management or would almost never be   \n        a reasonable price at which to split  \n        a stock.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n        Shareholder Defenses \u0097 Additional      \n        authorized shares could be used to    \n        bolster takeover defenses such as a   \n        poison pill. Proxy filings often      \n        discuss the usefulness of additional  \n  2.    shares in                             \n        defending against or discouraging a   \n        hostile takeover as a reason for a    \n        requested increase. Glass Lewis is    \n        typically against such defenses and   \n        will oppose actions intended to       \n        bolster such defenses.                \n                                              \n                                              \n        Financing for Acquisitions \u0097 We look   \n        at whether the company has a history  \n        of using stock for acquisitions and   \n        attempt to determine what levels of   \n  3.    stock have typically been required    \n        to                                    \n        accomplish such transactions.         \n        Likewise, we look to see whether      \n        this is discussed as a reason for     \n        additional shares in the proxy.       \n                                              \n                                              \n        Financing for Operations \u0097 We review   \n        the company\u0092s cash position and its    \n        ability to secure financing through   \n        borrowing or other means. We look at  \n  4.    the company\u0092s history of               \n        capitalization and whether the        \n        company has had to use stock in the   \n        recent past as a means of raising     \n        capital.                              \n                                              \nIssuing additional shares generally dilutes\nexisting holders in most circumstances.\nFurther, the availability of additional\nshares, where the board has discretion to\nimplement a poison pill, can often serve as a\ndeterrent to interested suitors. Accordingly,\nwhere we find that the company has not\ndetailed a plan for use of the proposed\nshares, or where the number of shares far\nexceeds those needed to accomplish a detailed\nplan, we typically recommend against the\nauthorization of additional shares. Similar\nconcerns may also lead us to recommend against\na proposal to conduct a reverse stock split if\nthe board does not state that it will reduce\nthe number of authorized common shares in a\nratio proportionate to the split.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  62  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nWith regard to authorizations and/or increases\nin preferred shares, Glass Lewis is generally\nagainst such authorizations, which allow the\nboard to determine the preferences,\nlimitations and rights of the preferred shares\n(known as \u0093blank-check preferred stock\u0094). We\nbelieve that granting such broad discretion\nshould be of concern to common shareholders,\nsince blank-check preferred stock could be\nused as an anti-takeover device or in some\nother fashion that adversely affects the\nvoting power or financial interests of common\nshareholders. Therefore, we will generally\nrecommend voting against such requests, unless\nthe company discloses a commitment to not use\nsuch shares as an anti-takeover defense or in\na shareholder rights plan, or discloses a\ncommitment to submit any shareholder rights\nplan to a shareholder vote prior to its\nadoption.\n\nWhile we think that having adequate shares to\nallow management to make quick decisions and\neffectively operate the business is critical,\nwe prefer that, for significant transactions,\nmanagement come to shareholders to justify\ntheir use of additional shares rather than\nproviding a blank check in the form of a large\npool of unallocated shares available for any\npurpose.\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements\n\nWe typically recommend that shareholders vote\nagainst proposals that would require advance\nnotice of shareholder proposals or of director\nnominees.\n\nThese proposals typically attempt to require a\ncertain amount of notice before shareholders\nare allowed to place proposals on the ballot.\nNotice requirements typically range between\nthree to six months prior to the annual\nmeeting. Advance notice requirements typically\nmake it impossible for a shareholder who\nmisses the deadline to present a shareholder\nproposal or a director nominee that might be\nin the best interests of the company and its\nshareholders.\n\nWe believe shareholders should be able to\nreview and vote on all proposals and director\nnominees. Shareholders can always vote against\nproposals that appear with little prior\nnotice. Shareholders, as owners of a business,\nare capable of identifying issues on which\nthey have sufficient information and ignoring\nissues on which they have insufficient\ninformation. Setting arbitrary notice\nrestrictions limits the opportunity for\nshareholders to raise issues that may come up\nafter the window closes.\n\nVirtual Shareholder Meetings\n\nA growing contingent of companies have elected\nto hold shareholder meetings by virtual means\nonly. Glass Lewis believes that virtual\nmeeting technology can be a useful complement\nto a traditional, in-personshareholder meeting\nby expanding participation of shareholders who\nare unable to attend a shareholder meeting in\nperson (i.e., a \u0093hybrid meeting\u0094). However, we\nalso believe that virtual-only meetings have\nthe potential to curb the ability of a\ncompany\u0092s shareholders to meaningfully\ncommunicate with the company\u0092s management.\n\nProminent shareholder rights advocates,\nincluding the Council of Institutional\nInvestors, have expressed concerns that such\nvirtual-only meetings do not approximate an\nin-personexperience and may serve to reduce\nthe board\u0092s accountability to shareholders.\nWhen analyzing the governance profile of\ncompanies that choose to hold virtual-only\nmeetings, we look for robust disclosure in a\ncompany\u0092s proxy statement which assures\nshareholders that they will be afforded the\nsame rights and opportunities to participate\nas they would at an in-personmeeting.\n\nExamples of effective disclosure include: (i)\naddressing the ability of shareholders to ask\nquestions during the meeting, including time\nguidelines for shareholder questions, rules\naround what types of questions are allowed,\nand rules for how questions and comments will\nbe recognized and disclosed to meeting\nparticipants; (ii) procedures, if any, for\nposting appropriate questions received during\nthe meeting and the company\u0092s\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  63  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nanswers, on the investor page of their website\nas soon as is practical after the meeting;\n(iii) addressing technical and logistical\nissues related to accessing the virtual\nmeeting platform; and (iv) procedures for\naccessing technical support to assist in the\nevent of any difficulties accessing the\nvirtual meeting.\n\nWe will generally recommend voting against\nmembers of the governance committee where the\nboard is planning to hold a virtual-only\nshareholder meeting and the company does not\nprovide such disclosure.\n\nVoting Structure\n\nMulti-Class Share Structures\n\nGlass Lewis believes multi-class voting\nstructures are typically not in the best\ninterests of common shareholders. Allowing one\nvote per share generally operates as a\nsafeguard for common shareholders by ensuring\nthat those who hold a significant minority of\nshares are able to weigh in on issues set\nforth by the board.\n\nFurthermore, we believe that the economic\nstake of each shareholder should match their\nvoting power and that no small group of\nshareholders, family or otherwise, should have\nvoting rights different from those of other\nshareholders. On matters of governance and\nshareholder rights, we believe shareholders\nshould have the power to speak and the\nopportunity to effect change. That power\nshould not be concentrated in the hands of a\nfew for reasons other than economic stake.\n\nWe generally consider a multi-class share\nstructure to reflect negatively on a company\u0092s\noverall corporate governance. Because we\nbelieve that companies should have share\ncapital structures that protect the interests\nof non-controllingshareholders as well as any\ncontrolling entity, we typically recommend\nthat shareholders vote in favor of\nrecapitalization proposals to eliminate dual-\nclass share structures. Similarly, we will\ngenerally recommend against proposals to adopt\na new class of common stock. We will generally\nrecommend voting against the chair of the\ngovernance committee at companies with a\nmulti-class share structure and unequal voting\nrights when the company does not provide for a\nreasonable sunset of the multi-class share\nstructure (generally seven years or less).\n\nIn the case of a board that adopts a multi-\nclass share structure in connection with an\nIPO, spin-off,or direct listing within the\npast year, we will generally recommend voting\nagainst all members of the board who served at\nthe time of the IPO if the board: (i) did not\nalso commit to submitting the multi-class\nstructure to a shareholder vote at the\ncompany\u0092s first shareholder meeting following\nthe IPO; or (ii) did not provide for a\nreasonable sunset of the multi-class structure\n(generally seven years or less). If the multi-\nclass share structure is put to a shareholder\nvote, we will examine the level of approval or\ndisapproval attributed to unaffiliated\nshareholders when determining the vote\noutcome.\n\nAt companies that have multi-class share\nstructures with unequal voting rights, we will\ncarefully examine the level of approval or\ndisapproval attributed to unaffiliated\nshareholders when determining whether board\nresponsiveness is warranted. In the case of\ncompanies that have multi-class share\nstructures with unequal voting rights, we will\ngenerally examine the level of approval or\ndisapproval attributed to unaffiliated\nshareholders on a \u0093one share, one vote\u0094 basis.\nAt controlled and multi-class companies, when\nat least 20% or more of unaffiliated\nshareholders vote contrary to management, we\nbelieve that boards should engage with\nshareholders and demonstrate some initial\nlevel of responsiveness, and when a majority\nor more of unaffiliated shareholders vote\ncontrary to management we believe that boards\nshould engage with shareholders and provide a\nmore robust response to fully address\nshareholder concerns.\n\nCumulative Voting\n\nCumulative voting increases the ability of\nminority shareholders to elect a director by\nallowing shareholders to cast as many shares\nof the stock they own multiplied by the number\nof directors to be elected. As companies\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  64  \n  States                                      \n                                              \ngenerally have multiple nominees up for\nelection, cumulative voting allows\nshareholders to cast all of their votes for a\nsingle nominee, or a smaller number of\nnominees than up for election, thereby raising\nthe likelihood of electing one or more of\ntheir preferred nominees to the board. It can\nbe important when a board is controlled by\ninsiders or affiliates and where the company\u0092s\nownership structure includes one or more\nshareholders who control a majority-voting\nblock of company stock.\n\nGlass Lewis believes that cumulative voting\ngenerally acts as a safeguard for shareholders\nby ensuring that those who hold a significant\nminority of shares can elect a candidate of\ntheir choosing to the board. This allows the\ncreation of boards that are responsive to the\ninterests of all shareholders rather than just\na small group of large holders.\n\nWe review cumulative voting proposals on a\ncase-by-casebasis, factoring in the\nindependence of the board and the status of\nthe company\u0092s governance structure. But we\ntypically find these proposals on ballots at\ncompanies where independence is lacking and\nwhere the appropriate checks and balances\nfavoring shareholders are not in place. In\nthose instances we typically recommend in\nfavor of cumulative voting.\n\nWhere a company has adopted a true majority\nvote standard (i.e., where a director must\nreceive a majority of votes cast to be\nelected, as opposed to a modified policy\nindicated by a resignation policy only), Glass\nLewis will recommend voting against cumulative\nvoting proposals due to the incompatibility of\nthe two election methods. For companies that\nhave not adopted a true majority voting\nstandard but have adopted some form of\nmajority voting, Glass Lewis will also\ngenerally recommend voting against cumulative\nvoting proposals if the company has not\nadopted anti-takeover protections and has been\nresponsive to shareholders.\n\nWhere a company has not adopted a majority\nvoting standard and is facing both a\nshareholder proposal to adopt majority voting\nand a shareholder proposal to adopt cumulative\nvoting, Glass Lewis will support only the\nmajority voting proposal. When a company has\nboth majority voting and cumulative voting in\nplace, there is a higher likelihood of one or\nmore directors not being elected as a result\nof not receiving a majority vote. This is\nbecause shareholders exercising the right to\ncumulate their votes could unintentionally\ncause the failed election of one or more\ndirectors for whom shareholders do not\ncumulate votes.\n\nSupermajority Vote Requirements\n\nGlass Lewis believes that supermajority vote\nrequirements impede shareholder action on\nballot items critical to shareholder\ninterests. An example is in the takeover\ncontext, where supermajority vote requirements\ncan strongly limit the voice of shareholders\nin making decisions on such crucial matters as\nselling the business. This in turn degrades\nshare value and can limit the possibility of\nbuyout premiums to shareholders. Moreover, we\nbelieve that a supermajority vote requirement\ncan enable a small group of shareholders to\noverrule the will of the majority\nshareholders. We believe that a simple\nmajority is appropriate to approve all matters\npresented to shareholders.\n                                              \n   Transaction of Other Business              \n                                              \nWe typically recommend that shareholders not\ngive their proxy to management to vote on any\nother business items that may properly come\nbefore an annual or special meeting. In our\nopinion, granting unfettered discretion is\nunwise.\n\nAnti-Greenmail Proposals\n\nGlass Lewis will support proposals to adopt a\nprovision preventing the payment of greenmail,\nwhich would serve to prevent companies from\nbuying back company stock at significant\npremiums from a certain shareholder. Since a\nlarge or majority shareholder could attempt to\ncompel a board into purchasing its shares at a\nlarge premium, the anti-greenmail provision\nwould generally require that a majority of\nshareholders other than the majority\nshareholder approve the buyback.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  65  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nMutual Funds: Investment Policies and Advisory\nAgreements\n\nGlass Lewis believes that decisions about a\nfund\u0092s structure and/or a fund\u0092s relationship\nwith its investment advisor or sub-advisorsare\ngenerally best left to management and the\nmembers of the board, absent a showing of\negregious or illegal conduct that might\nthreaten shareholder value. As such, we focus\nour analyses of such proposals on the\nfollowing main areas:\n                                              \n      The terms of any amended advisory or    \n      sub-advisory agreement;                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Any changes in the fee structure paid   \n      to the investment advisor; and          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Any material changes to the fund\u0092s       \n      investment objective or strategy.       \n                                              \nWe generally support amendments to a fund\u0092s\ninvestment advisory agreement absent a\nmaterial change that is not in the best\ninterests of shareholders. A significant\nincrease in the fees paid to an investment\nadvisor would be reason for us to consider\nrecommending voting against a proposed\namendment to an investment advisory agreement\nor fund reorganization. However, in certain\ncases, we are more inclined to support an\nincrease in advisory fees if such increases\nresult from being performance-based rather\nthan asset-based. Furthermore, we generally\nsupport sub-advisoryagreements between a\nfund\u0092s advisor and sub-advisor,primarily\nbecause the fees received by the sub-\nadvisorare paid by the advisor, and not by the\nfund.\n\nIn matters pertaining to a fund\u0092s investment\nobjective or strategy, we believe shareholders\nare best served when a fund\u0092s objective or\nstrategy closely resembles the investment\ndiscipline shareholders understood and\nselected when they initially bought into the\nfund. As such, we generally recommend voting\nagainst amendments to a fund\u0092s investment\nobjective or strategy when the proposed\nchanges would leave shareholders with stakes\nin a fund that is noticeably different than\nwhen originally purchased, and which could\ntherefore potentially negatively impact some\ninvestors\u0092 diversification strategies.\n\nReal Estate Investment Trusts\n\nThe complex organizational, operational, tax\nand compliance requirements of Real Estate\nInvestment Trusts (REITs) provide for a unique\nshareholder evaluation. In simple terms, a\nREIT must have a minimum of 100 shareholders\n(the 100 Shareholder Test) and no more than\n50% of the value of its shares can be held by\nfive or fewer individuals (the \u00935/50 Test\u0094).\nAt least 75% of a REITs\u0092 assets must be in\nreal estate, it must derive 75% of its gross\nincome from rents or mortgage interest, and it\nmust pay out 90% of its taxable earnings as\ndividends. In addition, as a publicly traded\nsecurity listed on a stock exchange, a REIT\nmust comply with the same general listing\nrequirements as a publicly traded equity.\n\nIn order to comply with such requirements,\nREITs typically include percentage ownership\nlimitations in their organizational documents,\nusually in the range of 5% to 10% of the REITs\noutstanding shares. Given the complexities of\nREITs as an asset class, Glass Lewis applies a\nhighly nuanced approach in our evaluation of\nREIT proposals, especially regarding changes\nin authorized share capital, including\npreferred stock.\n\nPreferred Stock Issuances at REITs\n\nGlass Lewis is generally against the\nauthorization of \u0093blank-check preferred\nstock.\u0094 However, given the requirement that a\nREIT must distribute 90% of its net income\nannually, it is inhibited from retaining\ncapital to make investments in its business.\nAs such, we recognize that equity financing\nlikely plays a key role in a REIT\u0092s growth and\ncreation of shareholder value. Moreover,\nshareholder concern regarding the use of\npreferred stock as an anti-takeover mechanism\nmay be allayed by the fact that most REITs\nmaintain ownership limitations in their\ncertificates of incorporation. For these\nreasons, along with the fact that REITs\ntypically do not engage in private placements\nof preferred stock (which result in the rights\nof common shareholders being adversely\nimpacted), we may support requests to\nauthorize shares of blank-check preferred\nstock at REITs.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  66  \n  States                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n   Business Development                       \n   Companies                                  \n                                              \nBusiness Development Companies (BDCs) were\ncreated by the U.S. Congress in 1980; they are\nregulated under the Investment Company Act of\n1940 and are taxed as regulated investment\ncompanies (RICs) under the Internal Revenue\nCode. BDCs typically operate as publicly\ntraded private equity firms that invest in\nearly stage to mature private companies as\nwell as small public companies. BDCs realize\noperating income when their investments are\nsold off, and therefore maintain complex\norganizational, operational, tax and\ncompliance requirements that are similar to\nthose of REITs\u0097the most evident of which is\nthat BDCs must distribute at least 90% of\ntheir taxable earnings as dividends.\n\nAuthorization to Sell Shares at a Price Below\nNet Asset Value\n\nConsidering that BDCs are required to\ndistribute nearly all their earnings to\nshareholders, they sometimes need to offer\nadditional shares of common stock in the\npublic markets to finance operations and\nacquisitions. However, shareholder approval is\nrequired in order for a BDC to sell shares of\ncommon stock at a price below Net Asset Value\n(NAV). Glass Lewis evaluates these proposals\nusing a case-by-caseapproach, but will\nrecommend supporting such requests if the\nfollowing conditions are met:\n                                              \n      The authorization to allow share        \n      issuances below NAV has an expiration   \n      date of one year or less from           \n      the date that shareholders approve the  \n      underlying proposal (i.e., the meeting  \n      date);                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      The proposed discount below NAV is      \n      minimal (ideally no greater than 20%);  \n                                              \n                                              \n      The board specifies that the issuance   \n      will have a minimal or modest dilutive  \n      effect (ideally no                      \n      greater than 25% of the company\u0092s        \n      then-outstanding common stock prior to  \n      the issuance); and                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      A majority of the company\u0092s independent  \n      directors who do not have a financial   \n      interest in the                         \n      issuance approve the sale.              \n                                              \nIn short, we believe BDCs should demonstrate a\nresponsible approach to issuing shares below\nNAV, by proactively addressing shareholder\nconcerns regarding the potential dilution of\nthe requested share issuance, and explaining\nif and how the company\u0092s past below-NAVshare\nissuances have benefitted the company.\n\nAuditor Ratification and Below-NAVIssuances\n\nWhen a BDC submits a below-NAVissuance for\nshareholder approval, we will refrain from\nrecommending against the audit committee chair\nfor not including auditor ratification on the\nsame ballot. Because of the unique way these\nproposals interact, votes may be tabulated in\na manner that is not in shareholders\u0092\ninterests. In cases where these proposals\nappear on the same ballot, auditor\nratification is generally the only \u0093routine\nproposal,\u0094 the presence of which triggers a\nscenario where broker non-votesmay be counted\ntoward shareholder quorum, with unintended\nconsequences.\n\nUnder the 1940 Act, below-NAVissuance\nproposals require relatively high shareholder\napproval. Specifically, these proposals must\nbe approved by the lesser of: (i) 67% of votes\ncast if a majority of shares are represented\nat the meeting; or (ii) a majority of\noutstanding shares. Meanwhile, any broker non-\nvotescounted toward quorum will automatically\nbe registered as \u0093against\u0094 votes for purposes\nof this proposal. The unintended result can be\na case where the issuance proposal is not\napproved, despite sufficient voting shares\nbeing cast in favor. Because broker non-\nvotesresult from a lack of voting instruction\nby the shareholder, we do not believe\nshareholders\u0092 ability to weigh in on the\nselection of auditor outweighs the\nconsequences of failing to approve an issuance\nproposal due to such technicality.\n\nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Companies\n\nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs),\nalso known as \u0093blank check companies,\u0094 are\npublicly traded entities with no commercial\noperations and are formed specifically to pool\nfunds in order to complete a\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  67  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nmerger or acquisition within a set time frame.\nIn general, the acquisition target of a SPAC\nis either not yet identified or otherwise not\nexplicitly disclosed to the public even when\nthe founders of the SPAC may have at least one\ntarget in mind. Consequently, IPO investors\noften do not know what company they will\nultimately be investing in.\n\nSPACs are therefore very different from\ntypical operating companies. Shareholders do\nnot have the same expectations associated with\nan ordinary publicly traded company and\nexecutive officers of a SPAC typically do not\ncontinue in employment roles with an acquired\ncompany.\n                                              \n   Extension of Business Combination          \n   Deadline                                   \n                                              \nGoverning documents of SPACs typically provide\nfor the return of IPO proceeds to common\nshareholders if no qualifying business\ncombination is consummated before a certain\ndate. Because the time frames for the\nconsummation of such transactions are\nrelatively short, SPACs will sometimes hold\nspecial shareholder meetings at which\nshareholders are asked to extend the business\ncombination deadline. In such cases, an\nacquisition target will typically have been\nidentified, but additional time is required to\nallow management of the SPAC to finalize the\nterms of the deal.\n\nGlass Lewis believes management and the board\nare generally in the best position to\ndetermine when the extension of a business\ncombination deadline is needed. We therefore\ngenerally defer to the recommendation of\nmanagement and support reasonable extension\nrequests.\n\nSPAC Board Independence\n\nThe board of directors of a SPAC\u0092s acquisition\ntarget is in many cases already established\nprior to the business combination. In some\ncases, however, the board\u0092s composition may\nchange in connection with the business\ncombination, including the potential addition\nof individuals who served in management roles\nwith the SPAC. The role of a SPAC executive is\nunlike that of a typical operating company\nexecutive. Because the SPAC\u0092s only business is\nidentifying and executing an acquisition deal,\nthe interests of a former SPAC executive are\nalso different. Glass Lewis does not\nautomatically consider a former SPAC executive\nto be affiliated with the acquired operating\nentity when their only position on the board\nof the combined entity is that of an otherwise\nindependent director. Absent any evidence of\nan employment relationship or continuing\nmaterial financial interest in the combined\nentity, we will therefore consider such\ndirectors to be independent.\n\nDirector Commitments of SPAC Executives\n\nWe believe the primary role of executive\nofficers at SPACs is identifying acquisition\ntargets for the SPAC and consummating a\nbusiness combination. Given the nature of\nthese executive roles and the limited business\noperations of SPACs, when a directors\u0092 only\nexecutive role is at a SPAC, we will generally\napply our higher limit for company\ndirectorships. As a result, we generally\nrecommend that shareholders vote against a\ndirector who serves in an executive role only\nat a SPAC while serving on more than five\npublic company boards.\n\nShareholder Proposals\n\nGlass Lewis believes that shareholders should\nseek to promote governance structures that\nprotect shareholders, support effective ESG\noversight and reporting, and encourage\ndirector accountability. Accordingly, Glass\nLewis places a significant emphasis on\npromoting transparency, robust governance\nstructures and companies\u0092 responsiveness to\nand engagement with shareholders. We also\nbelieve that companies should be transparent\non how they are mitigating material ESG risks,\nincluding those related to climate change,\nhuman capital management, and stakeholder\nrelations.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  68  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nTo that end, we evaluate all shareholder\nproposals on a case-by-casebasis with a view\nto protecting long-term shareholder value.\nWhile we are generally supportive of those\nthat promote board accountability, shareholder\nrights, and transparency, we consider all\nproposals in the context of a company\u0092s unique\noperations and risk profile.\n\nFor a detailed review of our policies\nconcerning compensation, environmental,\nsocial, and governance shareholder proposals,\nplease refer to our comprehensive Proxy Paper\nGuidelines for Shareholder Proposals & ESG-\nRelatedIssues, available at\nwww.glasslewis.com/voting-policies-current/ .\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  69  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nOverall Approach to Environmental, Social &\nGovernance Issues\n\nGlass Lewis evaluates all environmental and\nsocial issues through the lens of long-term\nshareholder value. We believe that companies\nshould be considering material environmental\nand social factors in all aspects of their\noperations and that companies should provide\nshareholders with disclosures that allow them\nto understand how these factors are being\nconsidered and how attendant risks are being\nmitigated. We also are of the view that\ngovernance is a critical factor in how\ncompanies manage environmental and social\nrisks and opportunities and that a well-\ngoverned company will be generally managing\nthese issues better than one without a\ngovernance structure that promotes board\nindependence and accountability.\n\nWe believe part of the board\u0092s role is to\nensure that management conducts a complete\nrisk analysis of company operations, including\nthose that have material environmental and\nsocial implications. We believe that directors\nshould monitor management\u0092s performance in\nboth capitalizing on environmental and social\nopportunities and mitigating environmental and\nsocial risks related to operations in order to\nbest serve the interests of shareholders.\nCompanies face significant financial, legal\nand reputational risks resulting from poor\nenvironmental and social practices, or\nnegligent oversight thereof. Therefore, in\ncases where the board or management has\nneglected to take action on a pressing issue\nthat could negatively impact shareholder\nvalue, we believe that shareholders should\ntake necessary action in order to effect\nchanges that will safeguard their financial\ninterests.\n\nGiven the importance of the role of the board\nin executing a sustainable business strategy\nthat allows for the realization of\nenvironmental and social opportunities and the\nmitigation of related risks, relating to\nenvironmental risks and opportunities, we\nbelieve shareholders should seek to promote\ngovernance structures that protect\nshareholders and promote director\naccountability. When management and the board\nhave displayed disregard for environmental or\nsocial risks, have engaged in egregious or\nillegal conduct, or have failed to adequately\nrespond to current or imminent environmental\nand social risks that threaten shareholder\nvalue, we believe shareholders should consider\nholding directors accountable. In such\ninstances, we will generally recommend against\nresponsible members of the board that are\nspecifically charged with oversight of the\nissue in question.\n\nWhen evaluating environmental and social\nfactors that may be relevant to a given\ncompany, Glass Lewis does so in the context of\nthe financial materiality of the issue to the\ncompany\u0092s operations. We believe that all\ncompanies face risks associated with\nenvironmental and social issues. However, we\nrecognize that these risks manifest themselves\ndifferently at each company as a result of a\ncompany\u0092s operations, workforce, structure,\nand geography, among other factors.\nAccordingly, we place a significant emphasis\non the financial implications of a company\u0092s\nactions with regard to impacts on its\nstakeholders and the environment.\n\nWhen evaluating environmental and social\nissues, Glass Lewis examines companies\u0092:\n\nDirect environmental and social risk\u0097\nCompanies should evaluate financial exposure\nto direct environmental risks associated with\ntheir operations. Examples of direct\nenvironmental risks include those associated\nwith oil or gas spills, contamination,\nhazardous leakages, explosions, or reduced\nwater or air quality, among others. Social\nrisks may include non-inclusiveemployment\npolicies, inadequate human rights policies, or\nissues that adversely affect the company\u0092s\nstakeholders. Further, we believe that firms\nshould consider their exposure to risks\nemanating from a broad range of issues, over\nwhich they may have no or only limited\ncontrol, such as insurance companies being\naffected by increased storm severity and\nfrequency resulting from climate change\n\nRisk due to legislation and regulation\u0097\nCompanies should evaluate their exposure to\nchanges or potential changes in regulation\nthat affect current and planned operations.\nRegulation should be carefully monitored in\nall jurisdictions in which the company\noperates. We look closely at relevant and\nproposed legislation and evaluate whether the\ncompany has responded proactively.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  70  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nLegal and reputational risk\u0097 Failure to take\naction on important environmental or social\nissues may carry the risk of inciting negative\npublicity and potentially costly litigation.\nWhile the effect of high-profile campaigns on\nshareholder value may not be directly\nmeasurable, we believe it is prudent for\ncompanies to carefully evaluate the potential\nimpacts of the public perception of their\nimpacts on stakeholders and the environment.\nWhen considering investigations and lawsuits,\nGlass Lewis is mindful that such matters may\ninvolve unadjudicated allegations or other\ncharges that have not been resolved. Glass\nLewis does not assume the truth of such\nallegations or charges or that the law has\nbeen violated. Instead, Glass Lewis focuses\nmore broadly on whether, under the particular\nfacts and circumstances presented, the nature\nand number of such concerns, lawsuits or\ninvestigations reflects on the risk profile of\nthe company or suggests that appropriate risk\nmitigation measures may be warranted.\n\nGovernance risk\u0097 Inadequate oversight of\nenvironmental and social issues carries\nsignificant risks to companies. When\nleadership is ineffective or fails to\nthoroughly consider potential risks, such\nrisks are likely unmitigated and could thus\npresent substantial risks to the company,\nultimately leading to loss of shareholder\nvalue.\n\nGlass Lewis believes that one of the most\ncrucial factors in analyzing the risks\npresented to companies in the form of\nenvironmental and social issues is the level\nand quality of oversight over such issues.\nWhen management and the board have displayed\ndisregard for environmental risks, have\nengaged in egregious or illegal conduct, or\nhave failed to adequately respond to current\nor imminent environmental risks that threaten\nshareholder value, we believe shareholders\nshould consider holding directors accountable.\nWhen companies have not provided for explicit,\nboard-level oversight of environmental and\nsocial matters and/or when a substantial\nenvironmental or social risk has been ignored\nor inadequately addressed, we may recommend\nvoting against members of the board. In\naddition, or alternatively, depending on the\nproposals presented, we may also consider\nrecommending voting in favor of relevant\nshareholder proposals or against other\nrelevant management-proposed items, such as\nthe ratification of auditor, a company\u0092s\naccounts and reports, or ratification of\nmanagement and board acts.\n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  71  \n  States                                      \n                                              \nConnect with Glass Lewis\n\nCorporate Website|www.glasslewis.com\n\nEmail|info@glasslewis.com\n\nSocial|@glasslewis Glass, Lewis & Co.\n\nGlobal Locations\n                                              \n             United\u00a0                          \n             States                           \n             Headqua\u2026                         \n             100\u00a0Pine                         \n             Street,\u00a0                         \n             Suite\u00a0                           \n             1925                             \n             San                              \n             Francis\u2026                         \n             CA 94111              Ireland    \n             +1                    15\u00a0Henry\u00a0  \n             415 678               Street     \n             4110 \u00a0                Limerick\u00a0  \n             New                   V94\u00a0V9T4   \n             York, NY              +353 61    \n             +1 646                534 343    \n             606 2345              United     \n             2323                  Kingdom    \n             Grand                 80\u00a0        \n             Bouleva\u2026              Coleman\u00a0   \n             Suite                 Street     \n             1125                  Suite      \n             Kansas                4.02       \n             City, MO              London     \n             64108 +1              EC2R 5BJ   \n  North      816 945               +44 20     \n  America    4525 \u00a0      Europe    7653 8800  \n  Asia       Austral\u2026              France     \n  Pacific    CGI                   Proxinve\u2026  \n             Glass                 6 Rue      \n             Lewis                 d\u0092Uz\u00e8s      \n             Suite                 75002      \n             5.03,                 Paris +33  \n             Level\u00a05               ()1\u00a045\u00a051  \n             255                   50\u00a043 \u00a0    \n             George                Germany    \n             Street                IVOX       \n             Sydney                Glass      \n             NSW 2000              Lewis      \n             +61 2                 Kaiseral\u2026  \n             9299                  23a 76133  \n             9266 \u00a0                Karlsruhe  \n             Japan                 +49 721    \n             Shinjuku              35 49622   \n             Mitsui                           \n             Building                         \n             11th                             \n             floor                            \n             2-1-1,                           \n             Nishi-S\u2026                         \n             Shinjuk\u2026                         \n             Tokyo                            \n             163-041\u2026                         \n             Japan                            \n                                              \n                                              \n  2024 Benchmark Policy Guidelines \u0097           \n  United                                  72  \n  States                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n   DISCLAIMER                                 \n                                              \n\u00a92024 Glass, Lewis & Co., and/or its\naffiliates.

For the 2025 proxy season, we are\nremoving the tiers and will be applying the\nfour pillars approach that was established by\nthe Task Force for Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD) to all companies where we\ncan appropriately assess these issues.\n\nOther Changes\n\nA number of updates have also been made to the\nGlass Lewis benchmark guidelines, which\nunderpin and inform the Climate Policy.\nFurther details can be found at\nwww.glasslewis.com\n                                       \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    4  \n  Guidelines                           \n                                       \nIntroduction\n\nInstitutional investors are increasingly\nrecognizing the importance of incorporating\nmaterial environmental, social, and governance\n(\u0093ESG\u0094) factors into their investment\nprocesses. Active ownership on ESG issues will\ntypically include also applying these\nconsiderations to proxy voting practices.\nFurthermore, climate change is presenting\nunprecedented risks to companies, investors\nand society, more broadly. As the physical,\nregulatory, legal and reputational risks\nassociated with climate change continue to\nmount, investors are taking an increasingly\nactive role in engaging companies on how they\nare mitigating their climate impacts and\nmanaging the related risks and opportunities\nto their businesses. One very important part\nof this active engagement is how investors are\ncasting votes in alignment with their\nportfolio-related climate risk strategies and\nin a manner that mitigates attendant risks to\nthe best extent possible. This policy allows\ninvestors to incorporate companies\u0092\ngovernance, oversight, management, and\nreporting of climate risks and opportunities\ninto their proxy voting practices.\n\nThe Climate Policy was designed for clients\nwith a strong focus on environmental risk\nmitigation as well as those who look to\npromote enhanced climate disclosure and\nclimate-related risk mitigation strategies.\nThe Climate Policy takes into account a\ncompany\u0092s size and sector in order ensure that\nshareholders execute votes that both promote a\ntransition to a low-carbonfuture and that make\nsense from a financial perspective in the\ncontext of a company\u0092s operations. The Climate\nPolicy underscores that, while all companies\nface risks attendant to climate change, these\nrisks will manifest themselves in different\nways. In addition, it recognizes that the\nmajority of the world\u0092s carbon emissions are\nemitted by select, systemically important\nemitters. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will\napply an additional layer of scrutiny to\nensure that those companies have effective\noversight of and mechanisms to respond to the\nchanging climate.\n\nThe Climate Policy is guided by the four\npillars originally established under the Task\nForce for Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD) which is based on four\npillars: governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets.\n\nGovernance:The Climate Policy will closely\nevaluate the roles and responsibilities of the\nboard and its committees in order to\nunderstand what level of oversight is afforded\nto environmental and climate- related risks\nand opportunities. In instances where a\ncompany does not afford proper oversight to\nthese issues, the Climate Policy will vote\nagainst relevant directors.\n\nStrategy:The Climate Policy will evaluate how\na company\u0092s strategy has incorporated issues\nrelated to climate change, by evaluating\nwhether the company has established GHG\nreduction goals. The Climate Policy will,\ndepending on the market, vote against either\nrelevant directors or a company\u0092s Accounts and\nReports at companies that have failed to\nestablish meaningful emissions reductions\ntargets.\n\nRisk Management:In order to determine how\nrisks related to climate change are\nestablished throughout an organization, the\nClimate Policy will carefully evaluate the\nincentive structures driving the top levels of\nan organization and to what extent climate and\nother environmental risks are built into a\ncompany\u0092s reward structures. When companies\nhave failed to provide an incentive structure\nthat properly takes into account climate and\nenvironmental issues, the Climate Policy will\nvote against a company\u0092s remuneration\nproposals.\n\nMetrics and Targets:Understanding that\nshareholders require comprehensive disclosure\nof companies\u0092 climate and sustainability-\nrelated risks, the Climate Policy will vote\nagainst relevant directors in instances where\na company has failed to provide adequate\ndisclosure to allow shareholders to evaluate\nhow a company is considering issues of climate\nchange. The Climate Policy will also evaluate\nif a company has provided disclosure on SASB\ntopics and metrics in order to determine to\nwhat level the company has provided thorough,\nfinancially-material, and comparable\ndisclosure to shareholders.\n                                       \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    5  \n  Guidelines                           \n                                       \nThe Climate Policy acts as an overlay for\nGlass Lewis\u0092 benchmark policies. Accordingly,\nthe Climate Policy guidelines are underpinned\nand informed by the Glass Lewis benchmark\npolicy guidelines. Implementation of the\nClimate Policy may vary market-to-marketin\naccordance with regulatory requirements,\ncorporate governance best practices, and other\nrelevant standards in individual markets.\nDetailed information on the contents and\nimplementation of Glass Lewis\u0092 benchmark\nguidelines for all major global markets are\npublicly available on the Glass Lewis website.\n                                       \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    6  \n  Guidelines                           \n                                       \nElection of Directors\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nBoards are established in order to represent\nshareholders and protect their interests.\nGlass Lewis seeks boards that have a record\nfor protecting shareholders and delivering\nvalue over the medium- and long-term. For\nboards that wish to protect and enhance the\ninterests of shareholders they must have\nsufficient levels of independence (the\npercentage varies by local market practice and\nregulations), boast a record of positive\nperformance, have directors with diverse\nbackgrounds, and appoint new directors that\nhave a depth of relevant experience.\n\nBoard Composition\n\nThe Climate Policy examines a variety of\nelements to the board when voting on director\nelections. In terms of the directors, the\npolicy looks at each individual on the board\nand explores their relationship with the\ncompany, the company\u0092s executives and with\nother board members. This is to ensure and\ndetermine whether a director has an existing\nrelationship with the company that are likely\nto impact any decision processes of that board\nmember.\n\nThe biographical information provided by the\ncompany on the individual director is\nessential for investors to understand the\nbackground and skills of the directors of the\nboard. This information should be provided in\nthe company\u0092s documents well in advance of the\nshareholder meeting, in order to give\nshareholders sufficient time to analyze the\ninformation. In cases where the company fails\nto disclose the names or backgrounds of\ndirector nominees, the Climate Policy may vote\nagainst or abstain from voting on the\ndirectors\u0092 elections.\n\nThe Climate Policy will vote in favor of\ngovernance structures that will drive positive\nperformance and enhance shareholder value. The\nmost crucial test of a board\u0092s commitment to\nthe company and to its shareholders is the\nperformance of the board and its members. The\nperformance of directors in their capacity as\nboard members and as executives of the\ncompany, when applicable, and in their roles\nat other companies where they serve is\ncritical to this evaluation.\n\nDirectors are formed into three categories\nbased on an examination of the type of\nrelationship they have with the company. The\ntable below includes a breakdown of how Glass\nLewis classifies these director relationships\nwith the company.\n                                       \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    7  \n  Guidelines                           \n                                       \n                                              \n  Insider        Affiliate      Independent   \n                 > A            > No          \n                 director       material      \n                 who has a      financial,    \n                 material       familial or   \n  > Someone      financial,     other         \n  who serves     familial or    current       \n  as a           other          relationshi\u2026  \n  director       relationsh\u2026    with the      \n  and            with the       company, it\u0092s  \n  as an          company, or    executives    \n  employee of    its            or other      \n  the Company    executives,    board         \n                 but is NOT     members       \n                 an employee    except for    \n                 of the         service       \n                 company                      \n                 > A                          \n                 director                     \n                 who owns or    > A director  \n  > May also     controls,      who owns,     \n  include        directly or    directly or   \n  executive      indirectly     indirectly    \n  chairs (who    20% or more    less than     \n  act as an      of the         10% of the    \n  employee of    company\u0092s       company\u0092s      \n  the company    voting         voting stock  \n  or is paid     stock          (local        \n  as an          (except        regulations   \n  employee of    where local    and best      \n  the            regulations    practices     \n  company)       or best        may set a     \n                 practices      different     \n                 set a          threshold)    \n                 different                    \n                 threshold).                  \n                 > A            > A director  \n                 director       who has not   \n                 who has        been          \n                 been           employed by   \n                 employed by    the company   \n                 the company    for a         \n                 within the     minimum of 5  \n                 past 5         calendar      \n                 calendar       years         \n                 years                        \n                 > A            > A director  \n                 director       who is not    \n                 who            involved in   \n                 performs       any Related   \n                 material       Party         \n                 consulting,    Transactions  \n                 legal,         (RPT) with    \n                 advisory,      the company   \n                 accounting     (most common  \n                 or other       RPT\u0092s -

Generally,\nthe Climate Policy will vote against\nresponsible directors if the board is less\nthan two-thirdsindependent, however, this is\nalso dependent on the best practice standards\nof the market in which the company is\ndomiciled.\n\nBoard Committee Composition\n\nIt is best practice to have independent\ndirectors serving on the audit, compensation,\nnominating and governance committees. As such,\nthe Climate Policy will support boards with\nthis structure and encourage change when this\nis not the case. However, board committee\nindependence thresholds may vary depending on\nthe market.\n\nWith respect to the creation of board\ncommittees and the composition thereof, the\nClimate Policy will generally support\nshareholder proposals requesting that\ncompanies create a committee to oversee\nclimate-related issues or the appointment of\nclimate experts to the board. The Climate\nPolicy will also support shareholder proposals\nrequesting the establishment of other\nenvironmental or social committees or the\nappointment of individuals with specific\nexpertise (such as human rights or public\npolicy) if the issue is deemed material to the\ncompany or if it is evident that the company\nhas provided insufficient oversight of the\nissue in question.\n\nBoard Oversight of Environmental and Social\nIssues\n\nThe Climate Policy is strongly focused on the\ngovernance that companies establish around\nmaterial environmental and social risks. The\nClimate Policy looks to companies to provide\nsome level of board oversight of these risks.\nDepending on a company\u0092s governance structure\nand that market in which it is domiciled, the\nClimate Policy will vote against the board\nchair or the chair of the audit committee if a\ncompany has not established proper risk\noversight of material environmental and social\nrisks.\n\nBoard Diversity, Tenure and Refreshment\n\nThe Climate Policy acknowledges the importance\nof ensuring that the board is comprised of\ndirectors who have a diversity of skills,\nbackgrounds, thoughts, and experiences. As\nsuch, having diverse boards benefits companies\ngreatly by encompassing an array of different\nperspectives and insights. The Climate Policy\nmay vote against the chair of the nominating\ncommittee when the board has failed to address\nthe lack of diverse skills, and experience of\nthe board members or when it fails to meet\nlegal requirements or relevant market best\npractice standards, and when the company has\nnot disclosed any explanation or plan\nregarding its approach to board diversity.\n\nIn terms of board tenure and refreshment, the\nClimate Policy strongly supports routine\ndirector evaluations, including independent\nexternal reviews, and periodic board\nrefreshment in order to enable the company to\nmaintain a fresh set of ideas and business\nstrategies in an ever-changing world and\nmarket. Having directors with diverse\nexperiences and skills can strengthen the\nposition of a company within the market.\nTherefore, the Climate Policy promotes\nrefreshment within boards, as a lack of\nrefreshment can lead to poor company\nperformance. Thus, the Climate Policy may\nconsider voting against directors with a\nlengthy tenure (e.g. over 12 years) when\nsignificant performance or governance concerns\nare identified that indicate a fresh\nperspective would be beneficial and there is\nno evidence of any plans of future board\nrefreshment.\n\nThe Climate Policy will also evaluate a\ncompany\u0092s policies and actions with respect to\nboard refreshment and diversity. As a part of\nthis evaluation, we will review the diversity\nof board members and support shareholder\nproposals to report on or increase board\ndiversity. The nominating and governance\ncommittee, as an agent for\n                                       \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    9  \n  Guidelines                           \n                                       \nthe shareholders, is responsible for the\ngovernance by the board of the company and its\nexecutives. In performing this role, the\ncommittee is responsible and accountable for\nselection of objective and competent board\nmembers. To that end, the Climate Policy will:\n(i) vote against members of the nominating\ncommittee in the event that the board has an\naverage tenure of over ten years and the board\nhas not appointed a new nominee to the board\nin at least five years; (ii) vote against the\nincumbent male nominating committee members in\ninstances where the board of a large- or mid-\ncapcompany is comprised of fewer than 30%\nfemale directors, or the local market\nrequirement for gender diversity where higher;\nor (iii) vote against the male members of the\nnominating committee where there is not at\nleast one woman on the board of a small-\ncapcompany.\n\nThe Climate Policy conducts a further level of\nanalysis for U.S. companies included in the\nRussel 1000 index. For these companies, the\nClimate Policy will vote against members of\nthe nominating and governance committee when\nthey receive a \u0093Poor\u0094 score in Glass Lewis\u0092\nDiversity Disclosure Assessment. The Diversity\nDisclosure Assessment is an analysis of\ncompanies\u0092 proxy statement disclosure relating\nto board diversity, skills and the director\nnomination process. This assessment reflects\nhow a company\u0092s proxy statement presents: (i)\nthe board\u0092s current percentage of\nracial/ethnic diversity; (ii) whether the\nboard\u0092s definition of diversity explicitly\nincludes gender and/or race/ethnicity; (iii)\nwhether the board has adopted a policy\nrequiring women and minorities to be included\nin the initial pool of candidates when\nselecting new director nominees (\u0093Rooney\nRule\u0094); and (iv) board skills disclosure.\n\nDirector Overboarding\n\nThe Climate Policy will generally recommend\nthat shareholders vote against a director who\nserves as an executive officer (other than\nexecutive chair) of any public company while\nserving on more than one external public\ncompany board, a director who serves as an\nexecutive chair of any public company while\nserving on more than two external public\ncompany boards, and any other director who\nserves on more than five public company\nboards.\n\nBoard Size\n\nAlthough there is not a universally acceptable\noptimum board size, boards should have a\nminimum of five directors to ensure sufficient\ndiversity in decision making and to enable the\nestablishment of key committees with\nindependent directors. Further, boards should\nnot be composed of more than 20 directors as\nthe board may suffer as a result of too many\nvoices to be heard and have difficulty\nreaching consensus on issues with this number\nof members. As a result, the Climate Policy\nwill generally vote against the chair of the\nnominating committee at a board with fewer\nthan five directors or more than 20 directors.\n\nClassified Boards\n\nThe Climate Policy favors the repeal of\nstaggered boards in favor of the annual\nelection of directors. Staggered boards are\ngenerally less accountable to shareholders\nthan annually elected directors to the board.\nIn addition, the annual election of directors\nencourages board members to focus on\nprotecting the interests of shareholders.\nFurther to this, if shareholders are\nunsatisfied with board members the annual\nelection of directors allows them to voice\nthese concerns.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    10  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nControlled Companies\n\nThe Climate Policy allows certain exceptions\nto the independence standards at controlled\ncompanies. The board\u0092s main function is to\nprotect shareholder interests, however, when\nan individual, entity, or group own more than\n50% of the voting shares, the interests of\nmajority shareholders are the interests of\nthat entity or individual. As a result, the\nClimate Policy does not apply the usual two-\nthirdsindependence threshold on controlled\ncompanies instead it includes the following\nguidelines:\n                                              \n         As long as insiders and/or           \n         affiliates are connected to the      \n  (i)    controlling entity, the Climate      \n         Policy will accept the presence of   \n         non-independent board members.       \n                                              \n                                              \n          The compensation, nominating, and   \n          governance committees do not need   \n          to consist solely of independent    \n  (ii)    directors. However, the             \n          compensation committee should not   \n          have any insider members, but       \n          affiliates are accepted.            \n                                              \n                                              \n           The board does not need an         \n  (iii)    independent chair or an            \n           independent lead or presiding      \n           director.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n          The audit committee should consist  \n  (iv)    solely of independent directors,    \n          regardless of the controlled        \n          status of the company.              \n                                              \nSignificant Shareholders\n\nSignificant shareholders are either an\nindividual or an entity which holds between\n20-50%of a company\u0092s voting power, and the\nClimate Policy provides that shareholders\nshould be allowed proportional representation\non the board and in committees (excluding the\naudit committee) based on their percentage of\nownership.\n\nDirector Performance and Oversight\n\nBoard members performance and their actions in\nregard to performance of the board is an\nessential element to understanding the board\u0092s\ncommitment to the company and to shareholders.\nThe Climate Policy will look at the\nperformance of individuals as directors and\nexecutives of the company and of other\ncompanies where they have served. Often a\ndirector\u0092s past conduct is indicative of\nfuture conduct and performance.\n\nThe Climate Policy will typically vote against\ndirectors who have served on boards or as\nexecutives of companies with records of poor\nperformance, inadequate risk oversight,\nexcessive compensation, audit or accounting-\nrelated issues, and other actions or\nindicators of mismanagement. However, the\nClimate Policy will also reevaluate the\ndirectors based on factors such as the length\nof time that has passed since the incident,\nthe director\u0092s role, and the severity of the\nissue.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Oversight and\nPerformance\n\nThe Climate Policy considers the oversight\nafforded to environmental and social issues.\nThe Climate Policy looks to ensure that\ncompanies maintain appropriate board-level\noversight of material risks to their\noperations, including those that are\nenvironmental and social in nature. When these\nrisks have not been properly managed or\nmitigated, the Climate Policy may vote against\nmembers of the board who are responsible for\nthe oversight of environmental and social\nrisks. In the absence of explicit board\noversight of environmental and social issues,\nthe Climate Policy may vote against members of\nthe audit committee. In making these\ndeterminations, the Climate Policy will\nconsider the situation at hand, its effect on\nshareholder value, as well as any corrective\naction or other response made by the company.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    11  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nDisclosure\n\nThe Climate Policy expects companies to\nprovide a sufficient level of disclosure to\nallow shareholders to understand the\nenvironmental and social risks facing the\ncompany and what steps it is taking to\nmitigate those risks. The Climate Policy seeks\nto ensure that companies have provided\ndisclosure concerning financially-material\nenvironmental and social risks in a\nstandardized manner, such as the reporting\nframeworks developed by the Global Reporting\nInitiative (GRI) or SASB. Such disclosure\nallows shareholders to assess a company\u0092s\nperformance against these risks as and to\nunderstand what strategies have been employed\nto help mitigate a company\u0092s exposure to these\nrisks. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will\nvote against relevant directors when a company\nhas not provided such disclosure.\nSpecifically, the Climate Policy will vote\nagainst directors charged with oversight of\nenvironmental and social issues at companies\nthat do not provide robust sustainability\ninformation. If the company does not maintain\nexplicit oversight of environmental and social\nissues, the Climate Policy will instead vote\nagainst the chair of the board or the audit\ncommittee chair (if the chair and CEO roles\nare combined).\n\nTarget Setting\n\nFor many companies, it is important that they\nestablish the appropriate management of their\nclimate-related impacts in order to\neffectively mitigate climate-related risks.\nWith this view, the Climate Policy seeks to\nensure that companies have established\nappropriate emissions reduction targets. As\nsuch, he Climate Policy will evaluate whether\ncompanies have established greenhouse gas\nemissions reduction goals, and whether those\ngoals have been externally verified to be\naligned the goals of the Paris Climate\nAgreement to limit global temperature increase\nto 1.5-degreesabove pre-industriallevels. In\ninstances where companies have failed to\nestablish such goals, the Climate Policy will\nvote against board members responsible for\noversight of environmental and social issues.\nIn instances where such oversight is not\nprovided, the Climate Policy will vote against\nthe chair of the board. If the chair is\ncombined with the CEO, the Climate Policy will\nvote against the audit committee chair.\n\nThe Climate Policy will vote against members\nof the board committee responsible for\noversight of environmental and social risk\nmanagement when a company has not committed to\nsetting science-based emissions reduction\ntargets through the Science Based Targets\nInitiative (SBTi). Such target setting\nprovides some assurance to shareholders that a\ncompany\u0092s goal is rigorous and aligned with\nscience. If no such board committee exists,\nthe Climate Policy will target the board\nchair, if the board chair is not also the\nCompany\u0092s CEO, or otherwise the chair of the\naudit committee if no such individual exists\nor is not standing for election.\n                                              \n   Review of Risk Management Controls         \n                                              \nThe Climate Policy evaluates the risk\nmanagement function of a public company on a\ncase-by-casebasis. Companies, particularly\nfinancial firms, should have a dedicated risk\ncommittee, or a committee on the board in\ncharge of risk oversight, as well as a chief\nrisk officer who reports directly to that\ncommittee, not to the CEO or another executive\nof the company. When analyzing the risk\nmanagement practices of public companies the\nClimate Policy takes note of any significant\nlosses or write-downs on financial assets\nand/or structured transactions. In cases where\na company has disclosed a sizable loss or\nwrite-down, and where the company\u0092s board-\nlevel risk committee\u0092s poor oversight\ncontributed to the loss, the Climate Policy\nwill recommend that shareholders vote against\nsuch committee members on that basis. In\naddition, in cases where a company maintains a\nsignificant level of financial risk exposure\nbut fails to disclose any explicit form of\nboard-level risk oversight (committee or\notherwise), the Climate Policy may vote\nagainst the chair of the board on that basis.\n\nSlate Elections\n\nIn some countries, in particular Italy,\ncompanies elect their board members as a\nslate, whereby shareholders are unable to vote\non the election of an individual director, but\nrather are limited to voting for or against\nthe\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    12  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nboard as a whole. The Climate Policy will\ngenerally support the slate if no major\ngovernance or board-related concerns have been\nraised in the analysis, and the slate appears\nto support and protect the best interests of\nall shareholders.\n\nBoard Responsiveness\n\nMajority-Supported Shareholder Proposals\n\nWe expect clear action from the board when\nshareholder proposals receive support from a\nmajority of votes cast (excluding abstentions\nand broker non-votes).In our view, this may\ninclude fully implementing the request of the\nshareholder proposal and/or engaging with\nshareholders on the issue and providing\nsufficient disclosures to address shareholder\nconcerns.\n\nSignificantly Supported Shareholder Proposals\n\nWhen shareholder proposals receive significant\nsupport (generally more than 30% but less than\nmajority of votes cast), we believe an initial\nlevel of board responsiveness is warranted. In\ninstances where a shareholder proposal has\nreceived at least 30% shareholder support, we\ngenerally believe boards should engage with\nshareholders on the issue and provide\ndisclosure addressing shareholder concerns and\noutreach initiatives.\n\nFurther, as discussed above, at controlled\ncompanies and companies that have multi-class\nshare structures with unequal voting rights,\nwe will carefully examine the level of\napproval or disapproval attributed to\nunaffiliated shareholders when determining\nwhether board responsiveness is warranted.\n\nSeparation of the Roles of CEO and Chair\n\nThe separation of the positions of CEO and\nchair creates a better and more independent\ngovernance structure than a combined CEO/chair\nposition. The role of executives is to manage\nthe business based on the course charted by\nthe board. Executives should be in the\nposition of reporting and answering to the\nboard for their performance in achieving their\ngoals as set out by the board. This would\nbecome more complicated if they too held the\nposition of chair as it would be difficult for\nthem to fulfil the duty of being both the\noverseer and policy setter when they, the\nCEO/chair control both the agenda and\nboardroom.\n\nThe Climate Policy views an independent chair\nas better able to oversee the executives of\nthe company and set a pro-shareholderagenda\nwithout the management conflicts that a CEO\nand other executive insiders often face. Such\noversight and concern for shareholders allows\nfor a more proactive and effective board of\ndirectors that is better able to look out for\nthe interests of shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, it is the board\u0092s responsibility\nto select a chief executive to best serve the\ncompany and its shareholders and to replace\nthis person when his or her duties have not\nbeen appropriately fulfilled. Such a\nreplacement becomes more difficult and happens\nless frequently when the chief executive is\nalso in the position of overseeing the board.\n\nHowever, even considering the above, the\nClimate Policy will not vote against CEOs who\nalso chair the board. The Climate Policy will\ngenerally support separating the positions of\nCEO and chair whenever the question is posed\nin a proxy, as in the long-term it is in the\nbest interests of the company.\n\nIn the absence of an independent chair, the\nClimate Policy will support the appointment of\na presiding or lead independent director with\nauthority to set the agenda for the meeting\nand to lead sessions. In the case where the\ncompany has neither an independent chair nor\nindependent lead director, the Climate Policy\nmay vote against the chair of the governance\ncommittee.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    13  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nGovernance Following an IPO or Spin-Off\n\nCompanies that have recently completed an\ninitial public offering (IPO), or spin-\noffshould be given adequate time to fully\nadjust and comply with marketplace listing\nrequirements and meet basic corporate\ngovernance standards. The Climate Policy\ngenerally allows the company a one-yearperiod\nfollowing the IPO to comply with these\nrequirements and as such refrains from voting\nbased on governance standards (e.g., board\nindependence, committee membership and\nstructure, meeting attendance, etc.).\n\nHowever, there are some cases that warrant\nshareholder action against the board of a\ncompany that have completed an IPO or spin-\noffin the past year. The Climate Policy will\nevaluate the terms of applicable governing\ndocuments when determining the recommendations\nand whether the shareholders rights will be\nseverely restricted. In order to come to a\nconclusion the following points will be\nconsidered:\n                                              \n        The adoption of anti-takeover         \n  1.    provisions such as a poison pill or   \n        classified board;                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  2.

In cases where the\nanti-takeover provision was adopted prior to\nthe IPO, the Climate Policy may against the\nmembers of the board who served when it was\nadopted if the board:\n                                              \n         Did not also commit to submit the    \n         anti-takeover provision to a         \n  (i)    shareholder vote at the company\u0092s     \n         next shareholder meeting following   \n         the IPO; or                          \n                                              \n                                              \n          Did not provide a sound rationale   \n  (ii)    or sunset provision for adopting    \n          the anti-takeover provision.        \n                                              \n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    14  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \n                                              \n   Financial Reporting                        \n                                              \nAccounts and Reports\n\nExcluding situations where there are concerns\nsurrounding the integrity of the\nstatements/reports, the Climate Policy will\ngenerally vote for Accounts and Reports\nproposals.\n\nWhere the required documents have not been\npublished at the time that the vote is cast,\nthe Climate Policy will abstain from voting on\nthis proposal.\n\nIncome Allocation (Distribution of Dividends)\n\nThe Climate Policy will generally vote for\nproposals concerning companies\u0092 distribution\nof dividends. However, particular scrutiny\nwill be given to cases where the company\u0092s\ndividend payout ratio is exceptionally low or\nexcessively high relative to its peers, and\nwhere the company has not provided a\nsatisfactory explanation for this disparity.\n\nAppointment of Auditors and Authority to Set\nFees\n\nThe role of the auditor is crucial in\nprotecting shareholder value. Like directors,\nauditors should be free from conflicts of\ninterest and should assiduously avoid\nsituations that require them to make choices\nbetween their own interests and the interests\nof the shareholders.\n\nThe Climate Policy will generally support\nmanagement\u0092s recommendation for the selection\nof an auditor, as well as the board\u0092s\nauthority to fix auditor fees. However, there\nare a number of exceptions to this policy, and\nthe Climate Policy will vote against the\nappointment of the auditor and/or the\nauthorization of the board to set auditor fees\nin the following scenarios:\n                                              \n      The independence of an incumbent        \n      auditor or the integrity of the audit   \n      has been compromised.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      Audit fees combined with audit-related  \n      fees total less than                    \n      one-half of total fees.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      There have been any recent              \n      restatements or late filings by the     \n      company and responsibility for such     \n      can be attributed to the auditor        \n      (e.g., a restatement due to a           \n      reporting error).                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      The company has aggressive accounting   \n      policies.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      The company has poor disclosure or      \n      lack of transparency in financial       \n      statements.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      There are other relationships, or       \n      issues of concern, with the auditor     \n      that might suggest a conflict           \n      of interest.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      The company is changing auditors as a   \n      result of a disagreement between the    \n      company and the auditor                 \n      on a matter of accounting principles    \n      or practices, financial statement       \n      disclosure, or auditing scope or        \n      procedures.                             \n                                              \n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    15  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nCompensation\n\nCompensation Reports and Compensation Policies\n\nDepending on the market, Compensation Report\nand Policy vote proposals may be either\nadvisory or binding,\n\ne.g. in the UK a non-bindingCompensation\nReport based upon the most recent fiscal year\nis voted upon annually, and a forward-looking\nCompensation Policy will be subject to a\nbinding vote every three years.\n\nIn all markets company filings are evaluated\nclosely to determine how well information\npertinent to Compensation practices has been\ndisclosed, the extent to which overall\ncompensation is tied to performance, which\nperformance metrics have been employed, as\nwell as how the company\u0092s remuneration\npractices compare to that of its peers.\n\nThe Climate Policy will vote against the\napproval of the Compensation Report or Policy\nin the following scenarios:\n                                              \n      There is a significant disconnect       \n      between pay and performance;

The Climate Policy will\nevaluate if, and to what extent, a company has\nprovided a link between compensation and\nenvironmental and social criteria. In most\nmarkets, should a company not provide any\nenvironmental or social considerations in its\nremuneration scheme, the Climate Policy will\nvote against the proposed plan. For companies\nwith a greater degree of exposure to\nenvironmental and climate-related issues, the\nClimate Policy will vote against compensation\nproposals if the company has not adequately\nincentivized executives to act in ways that\nmitigate a company\u0092s climate impact.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    16  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nLinking Compensation to Environmental and\nSocial Issues\n\nOn top of Glass Lewis\u0092 robust evaluation of\ncompanies\u0092 compensation plans, the Climate\nPolicy will evaluate if, and to what extent, a\ncompany has provided a link between\ncompensation and environmental and social\ncriteria. In most markets, should a company\nnot provide any environmental or social\nconsiderations in its remuneration scheme, the\nClimate Policy will vote against the proposed\nplan. Additionally, the Climate Policy will\nvote against compensation proposals if the\ncompany has not adequately incentivized\nexecutives to act in ways that mitigate a\ncompany\u0092s climate impact. The Climate Policy\nwill also support shareholder resolutions\nrequesting the inclusion of sustainability\nmetrics in executive compensation plans.\n\nLong-Term Incentive Plans\n\nThe Climate Policy recognizes the value of\nequity-based incentive programs. When used\nappropriately, they provide a means of linking\nan employee\u0092s pay to a company\u0092s performance,\nthereby aligning their interests with those of\nshareholders. In addition, equity-based\ncompensation is an effective way to attract,\nretain and motivate key employees.\n\nIn order to allow for meaningful shareholder\nreview, incentive programs should generally\ninclude:\n                                              \n  (i)    specific and appropriate             \n         performance goals;                   \n                                              \n                                     \n  (ii)    a maximum award pool; and  \n                                     \n                                              \n  (iii)    a maximum award amount per         \n           employee.                          \n                                              \nIn addition, the payments made should be\nreasonable relative to the performance of the\nbusiness and total compensation paid to those\nincluded under the plan should be in line with\ncompensation paid by the company\u0092s peers.\n\nPerformance-Based Equity Compensation\n\nThe Climate Policy supports performance-based\nequity compensation plans for senior\nexecutives; where it is warranted by both\ntheir performance, and that of the company.\nWhile it is unnecessary to base equity-based\ncompensation for all employees to company\nperformance, placing such limitations on\ngrants to senior executives is considered\nadvisable (although in specific scenarios\nequity-based compensation granted to senior\nexecutives without performance criteria is\nacceptable under Glass Lewis guidelines, such\nas in the case of moderate incentive grants\nmade in an initial offer of employment). While\nit is not uncommon for a board to state that\ntying equity compensation to performance goals\nmay hinder them in attracting, and retaining,\ntalented executives, the Climate Policy takes\nthe stance that performance \u0096 based\ncompensation aids in aligning executive\ninterests to that of shareholders, and as such\nwill support the company in achieving its\nobjectives.\n\nThe Climate Policy will generally vote in\nfavor of all performance-based option or share\nschemes; with the exception of plans that\ninclude a provision to allow for the re-\ntestingof performance conditions; for which a\nvote against is recommended.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    17  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nDirector Compensation\n\nThe Climate Policy supports non-\nemployeedirectors receiving an appropriate\nform, and level, of compensation for the time\nand effort they spend serving on the board and\nits committees; and director fees being at a\nlevel that allows a company to retain and\nattract qualified individuals. The Climate\nPolicy compares the cost of compensation to\nthat of peer companies with similar market\ncapitalizations in the same country so that\ncompensation plans may be evaluated\nthoroughly, and a fair vote outcome reached.\n\nRetirement Benefits for Directors\n\nThe Climate Policy will typically vote against\nthe granting of retirement benefits to non-\nexecutivedirectors. Such extended payments can\nimpair the objectivity and independence of\nthese board members. Initial, and annual fees\nshould be of a level that provides appropriate\ncompensation to directors throughout their\nservice to the company.\n\nLimits on Executive Compensation\n\nAs a general rule, shareholders should not\nseek to micromanage executive compensation\nprograms. Such matters should be left to the\nboard\u0092s compensation committee. The election\nof directors, and specifically those who sit\non the compensation committee, is viewed as an\nappropriate mechanism for shareholders to\nexpress their support, or disapproval, of\nboard policy on this issue. Further, companies\nwhose pay-for-performanceis in line with their\npeers should be granted the flexibility to\ncompensate their executives in a manner that\ndrives sustainable growth. However, the\nClimate Policy favors performance-based\ncompensation as an effective means of\nmotivating executives to act in the best\ninterests of shareholders. Performance-based\ncompensation may be limited if a chief\nexecutive\u0092s pay is capped at a low level\nrather than flexibly tied to the performance\nof the company.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    18  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nGovernance Structure\n\nAmendments to the Articles of Association\n\nThe Climate Policy will evaluate proposed\namendments to a company\u0092s articles of\nassociation on a case-by-casebasis. The\nClimate Policy is generally opposed to\nbundling several amendments under a single\nproposal as it prevents shareholders from\nevaluating each amendment on its own merits.\nIn cases, where it is a bundled amendment, the\nClimate Policy will evaluate each amendment\nindividually and only support the proposal if,\nin the aggregate, the amendments are in the\nbest interests of shareholders.\n\nAnti-Takeover Measures\n\nMulti-Class Share Structures\n\nThe Climate Policy views multi-class share\nstructures as not in the best interests of\nshareholders and instead is in favor of one\nvote per share. This structure operates as a\nsafeguard for common shareholders by ensuring\nthat those who hold a significant minority of\nshares are still able to weigh in on issues\nset forth by the board. The economic stake of\neach shareholder should match their voting\npower and that no small group of shareholders,\nfamily or otherwise, should have differing\nvoting rights from those of all other\nshareholders.\n\nThe Climate Policy considers a multi-class\nshare structure as having the potential to\nnegatively impact the overall corporate\ngovernance of a company. Companies should have\nshare class structures that protect the\ninterests of non-controllingshareholders as\nwell as any controlling entity. Therefore, the\nClimate Policy will generally vote in favor of\nrecapitalization proposals to eliminate multi-\nclass share structures. Similarly, the Climate\nPolicy will typically vote against proposals\nto adopt a new class of common stock.\n\nCumulative Voting\n\nWhen voting on cumulative voting proposals,\nthe Climate Policy will factor in the\nindependence of the board and the company\u0092s\ngovernance structure. Cumulative voting is\noften found on ballots at companies where\nindependence is lacking and where the\nappropriate balances favoring the interests of\nshareholders are not in place. However,\ncumulative voting increases the ability of\nminority shareholders to elect a director by\nallowing shareholders to cast as many shares\nof stock they own multiplied by the number of\ndirectors to be elected.\n\nCumulative voting allows shareholders to cast\nall their votes for one single nominee, or a\nsmaller number of nominees than up for\nelection, thereby raising the likelihood of\nelecting one or more of their preferred\nnominees to the board. Accordingly, cumulative\nvoting generally acts as a safeguard for\nshareholders by ensuring that those who hold a\nsignificant minority of shares can elect a\ncandidate of their choosing to the board. As a\nresult, the Climate Policy will typically vote\nin favor proposals concerning cumulative\nvoting.\n\nIn the case, where the company has adopted a\ntrue majority vote standard (i.e., where a\ndirector must receive a majority of votes cast\nto be elected, as opposed to a modified policy\nindicated by a resignation policy only), the\nClimate Policy will vote against cumulative\nvoting proposals due to the incompatibility of\nthe two election methods. For companies, that\nhave not adopted the true majority vote\nstandard but have some form of majority\nvoting, the Climate Policy will also recommend\nvoting against cumulative voting proposals if\nthe company has also not adopted anti-takeover\nprovisions and has been responsive to\nshareholder. In instances where a company has\nnot adopted majority voting standards and is\nfacing both an election on the adoption of\nmajority voting and a proposal to adopt\ncumulative voting, the Climate Policy will\nsupport only the majority voting proposal.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    19  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nFair Price Provision\n\nFair price provisions, which are rare, require\nthat certain minimum price and procedural\nrequirements to be observed by any party that\nacquires more than a specified percentage of a\ncorporation\u0092s common stock. The intention of\nthis provision is to protect minority\nshareholder value when an acquirer seeks to\naccomplish a merger or other transaction which\nwould eliminate or change the rights of the\nshareholder. Fair price provisions sometimes\nprotecting the rights of shareholders in a\ntakeover situation. However, more often than\nnot they act as an impediment to takeovers,\npotentially limiting gains to shareholders\nfrom a variety of transactions that could\npotentially increase share price. As a result,\nthe Climate Policy will generally vote to fair\nprice provisions.\n\nSupermajority Vote Requirements\n\nThe Climate Policy favors a simple majority\nvoting structure except where a supermajority\nvoting requirement is explicitly intended to\nprotect the rights of minority shareholders in\na controlled company. In the case of non-\ncontrolled companies, supermajority vote\nrequirements act as impediments to shareholder\naction on ballot items that are critical to\ntheir interests. For example, supermajority\nvote requirements can strongly limit the voice\nof shareholders in making decisions on\ncritical matters such as the selling of the\nbusiness. Supermajority vote requirements can\nalso allow small groups of shareholders to\noverrule and dictate the will of the majority\nof shareholders. Thus, having a simple\nmajority is appropriate for protecting the\nrights of all shareholders.\n\nPoison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plan)\n\nThe Climate Policy will generally oppose\ncompanies\u0092 adoption of poison pills, as they\ncan reduce management accountability by\nsubstantially limiting opportunities for\ncorporate takeovers. As a result, rights plans\ncan prevent shareholders from receiving a buy-\noutpremium for their stock. Generally, the\nClimate Policy will vote against these plans\nto protect their financial interests. While\nboards should be given wide latitude in\ndirecting the activities of the company and\ncharting the company\u0092s course, on an issue\nsuch as this where the link between the\nfinancial interests of shareholders and their\nright to consider and accept buyout offers is\nso substantial, shareholders should be allowed\nto vote on whether or not they support such a\nplan\u0092s implementation. In certain limited\ncircumstances, the Climate Policy will support\na limited poison pill to accomplish a\nparticular objective, such as the closing of\nan important merger, or a pill that contains\nwhat we believe to be a reasonable \u0091qualifying\noffer\u0092 clause.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    20  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nIncrease in Authorized Shares\n\nAdequate capital stock is important to a\ncompany\u0092s operation. When analyzing a request\nfor additional shares, the Climate Policy will\ntypically review four common reasons why a\ncompany may need additional capital stock:\n                                              \n                         Three Metrics:       \n                         a.\u2002\u2009\u200aHistorical      \n                         stock pre-split      \n                         price (if            \n                         any) b.\u2002\u2009Current     \n                         price relative to    \n                         the company\u0092s most    \n                         common trading       \n  1.

The Climate Policy favors that,\nwhen a company is undertaking significant\ntransactions, management will justify its use\nof additional shares rather than providing a\nblank check in the form of large pools of\nunallocated shares available for any purpose.\n\nGenerally, the Climate Policy will support\nproposals to increase authorized shares up to\n100% of the number of shares currently\nauthorized unless, after the increase the\ncompany would be left with less than 30% of\nits authorized shares outstanding. In markets\nwhere such authorities typically also\nauthorize the board to issue new shares\nwithout separate shareholder approval, the\nClimate Policy applies the policy described\nbelow on the issuance of shares.\n\nIssuance of Shares\n\nThe issuance of additional shares generally\ndilutes existing shareholders in most\ncircumstances. Further, the availability of\nadditional shares, where the board has\ndiscretion to implement a poison pill, can\noften serve as a deterrent to interested\nsuitors. In cases where a company has not\ndetailed a plan for use of the proposed\nshares, or where the number of shares far\nexceeds those needed to accomplish a detailed\nplan, the Climate Policy will typically vote\nagainst the authorization of additional\nshares. In the case of a private placement,\nthe Climate Policy will also factor in whether\nthe company is offering a discount to its\nshare price.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    21  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nGenerally, the Climate Policy will support\nproposals to authorize the board to issue\nshares (with pre-emptiverights) when the\nrequested increase is equal to or less than\nthe current issued share capital. The\nauthority of these shares should not exceed\nfive years unless that is the market best\npractice. In accordance with the different\nmarket practices, the specific thresholds for\nshare issuance can vary. And, as a result, the\nClimate Policy will vote on these proposals on\na case-by-casebasis.\n\nThe Climate Policy will also generally support\nproposals to suspend pre-emptionrights for a\nmaximum of 5-20%of the issued ordinary share\ncapital of the company, depending on best\npractice in the country in which the company\nis located. This authority should not exceed\nfive years, or less for some countries.\n\nRepurchase of Shares\n\nThe Climate Policy typically supports\nproposals to repurchase shares when the plan\nincludes the following provisions:\n                                              \n         A maximum number of shares which     \n  (i)    may be purchased (typically not      \n         more than 10-15% of the issued       \n         share capital); and                  \n                                              \n                                              \n          A maximum price which may be paid   \n  (ii)    for each share (as a percentage of  \n          the market price).                  \n                                              \nReincorporation\n\nA company is in the best position to determine\nthe appropriate jurisdiction of incorporation.\nThe Climate Policy will factor in several\nelements when a management proposal to\nreincorporate the company is put to vote.\n\nThese elements include reviewing the relevant\nfinancial benefits, generally related to\nincorporate tax treatment, as well as changes\nin corporate governance provisions, especially\nthose related to shareholder rights, resulting\nfrom the change in domicile. In cases where\nthe financial benefits are too small to be\nmeaningful and there is a decrease in\nshareholder rights, the Climate Policy will\nvote against the transaction.\n\nTax Havens\n\nThe Climate Policy evaluates a company\u0092s\npotential exposure to risks related to a\ncompany\u0092s tax haven policies on an as-\nneededbasis and will support shareholder\nproposals requesting that companies report on\nthe risks associated with their use of tax\nhavens or that request that companies adopt\npolicies to discontinue operations or withdraw\nfrom tax havens. The Climate Policy will also\nvote against reincorporation proposals when\ncompanies have proposed to redomicile in known\ntax havens.\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements\n\nTypically, the Climate Policy will recommend\nvote against provisions that would require\nadvance notice of shareholder proposals or of\ndirector nominees. Advance notice requirements\ntypically range between three to six months\nprior to the annual meeting. These\nrequirements often make it impossible for a\nshareholder who misses the deadline to present\na shareholder proposal or director nominee\nthat may be in the best interests of the\ncompany. Shareholders should be able to review\nand vote on all proposals and director\nnominees and are able to vote against\nproposals that appear with little prior\nnotice. Therefore, by setting advance notice\nrequirements it limits the opportunity for\nshareholders to raise issues that may arise\nafter the window closes.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    22  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \n                                              \n   Transaction of Other                       \n   Business                                   \n                                              \nIn general, the Climate Policy will vote\nagainst proposals that put the transaction of\nother business items proposal up for vote at\nan annual or special meeting, as granting\nunfettered discretion is unwise.\n\nAnti-Greenmail Proposals\n\nThe Climate Policy will support proposals to\nadopt a provision preventing the payment of\ngreenmail, which would serve to prevent\ncompanies from buying back company stock at\nsignificant premiums from a certain\nshareholder. The anti-greenmail provision\nhelps to protect the company as it requires\nthat a majority of shareholders other than the\nmajority shareholder approve the buyback,\nthus, eliminating cases where a majority\nshareholder could attempt to charge a board a\nlarge premium for the shares.\n\nVirtual-Only Shareholder Meetings\n\nA growing number of companies have elected to\nhold shareholder meetings by virtual means\nonly. The Climate Policy supports companies\nallowing a virtual option alongside an in-\npersonmeeting, so long as the shareholder\ninterests are not compromised. Without proper\ncontrols, conducting a virtual-only meeting of\nshareholders could eliminate or significantly\nlimit the rights of shareholders to confront,\nand ask management on any concerns they may\nhave. When companies decide to only hold\nvirtual-only meetings, the Climate Policy will\nexamine the level of disclosure provided by\nthe company on the virtual meeting procedures\nand base the voting outcome on that level of\ndisclosure.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    23  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nMergers, Acquisitions & Contested Meetings\n\nFor merger and acquisition proposals, the\nClimate Policy undertakes a thorough\nexamination of all elements of the\ntransactions and determine the transaction\u0092s\nlikelihood of maximizing shareholder return.\nIn order to make a voting recommendation, the\nClimate Policy will examine the process\nconducted, the specific parties and\nindividuals involved in negotiating an\nagreement, as well as the economic and\ngovernance terms of the proposal.\n\nIn the case of contested merger situations, or\nboard proxy fights, the Climate Policy will\nevaluate the plan presented by the dissident\nparty and how, if elected, it plans to enhance\nor protect shareholder value. The Climate\nPolicy will also consider any concerns\npresented by the board, including any plans\nfor improving the performance of the company,\nwhen making the ultimate recommendation.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    24  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nShareholder Proposals\n\nThe Climate Policy has a strong emphasis on\nmitigating climate-related risks and promoting\nclimate-related accountability. At the same\ntime, the Climate Policy places significant\nfocus on materiality and the protection and\nenhancement of shareholder value. Because not\nall shareholder proposals, particularly those\nthat deal with environmental and social\nissues, make sense in the context of a\ncompany\u0092s unique operations and circumstances,\nthe Climate Policy will carefully examine the\nrequest of each proposal to ensure that it\npromotes a company\u0092s environmental and\nfinancial sustainability. The Climate Policy\nwill carefully examine each proposal\u0092s merits\nin order to ensure it seeks enhanced\nenvironmental disclosure and/or practices, and\nis not conversely aimed at limiting\nenvironmental or social disclosure or\npractices. Accordingly, the Climate Policy\nwill not support proposals aimed at limiting\nor rescinding companies\u0092 ESG-\nrelateddisclosures, goals or initiatives\n\nWith the exception of shareholder proposals\naddressed below, the Climate Policy will\ngenerally only support proposals that have\nbeen determined to be financially material for\nthe company. Specifically, for most\nenvironmental and social proposals, the\nClimate Policy will support such proposals\nwhen: (i) the proposal is deemed to address a\nmaterial topic for the Company and its\nindustry, as determined by SASB; or (ii) Glass\nLewis\u0092 standard policy recommends in favor of\nthe resolution.\n\nGovernance Proposals\n\nThe Climate Policy supports increased\nshareholder participation and access to a\ncompany and its board of directors.\nAccordingly, the Climate Policy will vote in\nfavor of initiatives that seek to enhance\nshareholder rights, such as the introduction\nof majority voting to elect directors, the\nadoption and amendment of proxy access bylaws,\nthe elimination/reduction of supermajority\nprovisions, the declassification of the board,\nthe submission of shareholder rights\u0092 plans to\na shareholder vote, and the principle of one\nshare, one vote.\n\nThe Climate Policy will also support proposals\naimed at increasing the diversity of boards or\nmanagement as well as those requesting\nadditional information concerning workforce\ndiversity and the adoption of more inclusive\nnondiscrimination policies. Further, the\nClimate Policy will support enhanced oversight\nof environmental and social issues at the\nboard level by supporting resolutions calling\nfor the creation of a climate-related\ncommittee of the board or proposals requesting\nthat the board adopt a subject-matter expert,\nsuch as one with deep knowledge and experience\nin climate change-related issues. The Climate\nPolicy will also generally vote for proposals\nseeking to increase disclosure of a company\u0092s\nbusiness ethics and code of conduct, as well\nas of its activities that relate to social\nwelfare.\n\nEnvironmental and Climate-Related Proposals\n\nThe Climate Policy will generally support\nproposals regarding the environment, in\nparticular, those seeking improved disclosure.\nThe Climate Policy will generally vote in\nfavor of shareholder proposals requesting\nadditional disclosure concerning climate-\nrelated risks well as those requesting\ncompliance with international environmental\nconventions and adherence to environmental\nprinciples. Similarly, the Climate Policy will\nsupport proposals requesting companies develop\ngreenhouse gas emissions reduction goals,\ncomprehensive recycling programs, and other\nproactive means to mitigate a company\u0092s\nenvironmental footprint.\n\nThe Climate Policy will also support proposals\nrequesting that companies provide certain\ndisclosures or adopt certain policies related\nto mitigating their climate change-related\nrisks. For example, the Climate Policy will\nsupport proposals requesting that companies\ndisclose information concerning their scenario\nanalyses or that\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    25  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nrequest the company provide disclosure\nconcerning specific climate-related risks or\nimpacts.. Further, the Climate Policy will\nsupport proposals requesting that a company\nconsider energy efficiency and renewable\nenergy sources in its project development and\noverall business strategy.\n\nThe Climate Policy will also generally support\nproposals seeking to tie executive\ncompensation to climate mitigation activities\nor those that request that companies adjust\ntheir compensation practices to ensure that\nthey are more aligned with a transition to a\nlow-carboneconomy.\n\nSay on Climate\n\nShareholder Proposals\n\nBeginning in 2021, companies began placing\nmanagement proposals on their ballots that ask\nshareholders to vote on their climate\ntransition plans, or a Say on Climate vote.\nThe Climate Policy will generally recommend in\nfavor of shareholder proposals requesting that\ncompanies adopt a Say on Climate vote.\n                                              \n   Management Proposals                       \n                                              \nThe Climate Policy looks to companies to\nclearly articulate their climate plans in a\ndistinct and easily understandable document.\nIn this disclosure, it is important that\ncompanies clearly explain their goals, how\ntheir GHG emissions targets support\nachievement of broader goals (i.e. net zero\nemissions goals), and any foreseeable\nobstacles that could hinder their progress on\nthese initiatives.\n\nWhen evaluating these proposals, the Climate\nPolicy will generally support proposals put\nforth by management, however, consider a\nvariety of factors, including: (i) the request\nof the resolution (e.g., whether companies are\nasking shareholders to approve its disclosure\nor its size; whether the company\u0092s GHG\nemissions targets and the disclosure of these\ntargets appear reasonable in light of its\noperations and risk profile; and (iv) where\nthe company is on its climate reporting\njourney (e.g., whether the company has been\nreporting and engaging with shareholders on\nclimate risk for a number of years or if this\nis a relatively new initiative).\n\nSocial Proposals\n\nThe Climate Policy will support proposals\nrequesting that a company develop sustainable\nbusiness practices, such as animal welfare\npolicies, human rights policies, and fair\nlending policies. Furthermore, the Climate\nPolicy will support reporting and reviewing a\ncompany\u0092s political and charitable spending as\nwell as its lobbying practices. In addition,\nthe Climate Policy will support proposals\nrequesting that companies cease political\nspending or associated activities.\n\nThe Climate Policy will also generally support\nenhancing the rights of workers, as well as\nconsidering the communities and broader\nconstituents in the areas in which companies\ndo business. Accordingly, the Climate Policy\nwill generally vote for proposals requesting\nthat companies provide greater disclosure\nregarding impact on local stakeholders,\nworkers\u0092 rights and human rights in general.\nIn addition, the Climate Policy will support\nproposals for companies to adopt or comply\nwith certain codes of conduct relating to\nlabor standards, human rights conventions, and\ncorporate responsibility at large. The Climate\nPolicy will also support proposals requesting\nindependent verification of a company\u0092s\ncontractors\u0092 compliance with labor and human\nrights standards. In addition, the Climate\nPolicy supports the International Labor\nOrganization standards and encourage companies\nto adopt such standards in its business\noperations.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    26  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nThe Climate Policy will provide for a review\nof the performance and oversight of certain\ndirectors in instances in which a company is\nfound to have violated international human\nrights standards. Pursuant to the Climate\nPolicy, if directors have not adequately\noverseen the overall business strategy of the\ncompany to ensure that basic human rights\nstandards are met or if a company is subject\nto regulatory or legal action with a foreign\ngovernment or entity due to human rights\nviolations, the Policy may vote against\ndirectors taking into account the severity of\nthe violations and the outcome of the claims.\n\nThe Climate Policy also generally votes in\nfavor of proposals seeking increased\ndisclosure regarding public health and safety\nissues, including those related to product\nresponsibility. In particular, the Climate\nPolicy supports proposals calling for the\nlabeling of the use of genetically modified\norganisms (GMOs), the elimination or reduction\nof toxic emissions and use of toxic chemicals\nin manufacturing, and the prohibition of\ntobacco sales to minors. The Climate Policy\nalso supports proposals seeking a report on a\ncompany\u0092s drug reimportation guidelines, as\nwell as on a company\u0092s ethical responsibility\nas it relates to drug distribution and\nmanufacture. The Climate Policy further\nsupports proposals related to worker safety\nand companies\u0092 compliance with internationally\nrecognized human rights or safety standards.\n\nCompensation Proposals\n\nThe Climate Policy recognizes that ESG\nperformance factors should be an important\ncomponent of the overall consideration of\nproper levels of executive performance and\ncompensation. Therefore, the Climate Policy\ngenerally votes in favor of proposals seeking\nto tie executive compensation to performance\nmeasures such as compliance with environmental\nregulations, health and safety regulations,\nnondiscrimination laws and compliance with\ninternational human rights standards.\nFurthermore, the Climate Policy will generally\nsupport proposals that seek to evaluate\noverall director performance based on\nenvironmental and social criteria.\n\nThe Climate Policy will support proposals\nseeking to prohibit or require more disclosure\nabout stock hedging and pledging by\nexecutives. The Climate Policy will also\ngenerally support proposals requesting that\ncompanies adopt executive stock retention\npolicies and prohibiting the accelerated\nvesting of equity awards. Furthermore, the\nClimate Policy will vote in favor of\nshareholder proposals to link pay with\nperformance, to eliminate or require\nshareholder approval of golden coffins, and to\nclawback unearned bonuses. Finally, the\nClimate Policy will support proposals\nrequesting disclosure from companies regarding\ngender pay inequity and company initiatives to\nreduce the gap in compensation paid to women\ncompared to men.\n\nVote-NoCampaigns\n\nThe Climate Policy will carefully review any\n\u0093vote-no\u0094campaigns launched by shareholders as\na result of their concerns regarding a\ncompany\u0092s failure to adequately oversee\nenvironmental and social risks or those\nrelated to poor compensation or governance\npractices. When it is determined that such\ncampaigns either address a failure of\noversight on behalf of the company or that\nbroadly seek to promote more responsible\ncorporate behavior, the Climate Policy may\nvote in line with the recommendations of the\nshareholder(s) running the vote-nocampaign.\n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    27  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \nConnect with Glass Lewis\n                                              \n  Corporate\u00a0Website    | www.glasslewis.com   \n  Email                | info@glasslewis.com  \n                       |                      \n  Social               @glasslewis            \n                       Glass, Lewis\u00a0& Co.     \n                                              \nGlobal Locations\n                                              \n             United                           \n             States                           \n             Headquar\u2026                        \n             100 Pine                         \n             Street,                          \n             Suite                  Ireland   \n             1925 San               15 Henry  \n             Francisc\u2026              Street    \n             CA 94111               Limerick  \n             +1 415                 V94       \n             678 4110               V9T4      \n             New York,              +353 61   \n             NY                     534 343   \n             +1 646                 United    \n             606 2345               Kingdom   \n             2323                   80        \n             Grand                  Coleman   \n             Boulevard              Street    \n             Suite                  Suite     \n             1125                   4.02      \n             Kansas                 London    \n             City, MO               EC2R 5BJ  \n             64108                  +44 20    \n  North      +1 816                 7653      \n  America    945 4525     Europe    8800      \n  Asia       Australia              France    \n  Pacific    CGI Glass              Proxinv\u2026  \n             Lewis                  6 Rue     \n             Suite                  d\u0092Uz\u00e8s     \n             5.03,                  75002     \n             Level\u00a05                Paris     \n             255                    +33 ()1   \n             George                 45 51 50  \n             Street                 43 \u00a0      \n             Sydney                 Germany   \n             NSW 2000               IVOX      \n             +61 2                  Glass     \n             9299 9266              Lewis     \n             Japan                  Kaisera\u2026  \n             Shinjuku               23a       \n             Mitsui                 76133     \n             Building               Karlsru\u2026  \n             11th                   +49 721   \n             floor                  35 49622  \n             2-1-1,\u00a0                          \n             Nishi-Sh\u2026                        \n             Shinjuku\u2026                        \n             Tokyo                            \n             163-0411,                        \n             Japan                            \n                                              \n                                        \n  Climate Thematic Voting Policy    28  \n  Guidelines                            \n                                        \n                                              \n   DISCLAIMER                                 \n                                              \n\u00a92025 Glass, Lewis & Co., and/or its\naffiliates.

Annually,\nGlass Lewis updates its policy guidelines in\naccordance with market trends, developments\nand the results of our ongoing consultations.\n\nIn advance of the 2025 proxy season, Glass\nLewis has not made material revisions to the\nCorporate Governance Focused Thematic Voting\nPolicy.\n                                              \n   Overview                                   \n                                              \nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy is\ndesigned to ensure compliance with the\nfiduciary responsibility to drive long-term,\neconomic shareholder value with additional\nemphasis on widely accepted components of\ncorporate governance. While the Policy\nreflects analysis and identification of both\nfinancial and corporate governance risk, the\nCorporate Governance Focused Policy also\nincludes consideration of key shareholder\nrights in making proxy voting decisions.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\nvote in favor of governance structures that\nwill drive positive performance or enhance\nshareholder value and believes that policies\nare generally best left to management and the\nboard absent a showing of egregious or illegal\nconduct that might threaten shareholder value.\nThe most crucial test of a board\u0092s commitment\nto the company and to its shareholders is the\nperformance of the board and its members. The\nperformance of directors in their capacity as\nboard members and as executives of the\ncompany, when applicable, and in their roles\nat other companies where they serve is\ncritical to this evaluation.\n\nDirectors are formed into three categories\nbased on an examination of the type of\nrelationship they have with the company. The\ntable below includes a breakdown of how Glass\nLewis classifies these director relationships\nwith the company.\n                                              \n  Insider        Affiliate      Independent   \n                 A director     No material   \n                 who has a      financial,    \n                 material       familial or   \n                 financial,     other         \n  Someone who    familial or    current       \n  serves as a    other          relationshi\u2026  \n  director       relationsh\u2026    with the      \n  and as         with the       company, it\u0092s  \n  an employee    company, or    executives    \n  of the         its            or other      \n  Company        executives,    board         \n                 but is NOT     members       \n                 an employee    except for    \n                 of the         service       \n                 company                      \n                 A director                   \n                 who owns or    A director    \n                 controls,      who owns,     \n  May also       directly or    directly or   \n  include        indirectly     indirectly    \n  executive      20% or more    less than     \n  chairs (who    of the         10% of the    \n  act as an      company\u0092s       company\u0092s      \n  employee of    voting         voting stock  \n  the company    stock          (local        \n  or is paid     (except        regulations   \n  as an          where local    and best      \n  employee of    regulations    practices     \n  the            or best        may set a     \n  company)       practices      different     \n                 set a          threshold)    \n                 different                    \n                 threshold).                  \n                 >A director    >A director   \n                 who has        who has not   \n                 been           been          \n                 employed by    employed by   \n                 the company    the company   \n                 within         for a         \n                 the past 5     minimum of 5  \n                 calendar       calendar      \n                 years          years         \n                                              \n                                              \n  Corporate Governance Focused Thematic       \n  Voting                                   4  \n  Policy Guidelines                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  >A director who       >A director who is    \n  performs material     not involved in any   \n  consulting, legal,    Related Party         \n  advisory,             Transactions          \n  accounting or         (RPT) with the        \n  other                 company (most common  \n  professional          RPT\u0092s -

As such,\nthe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\nsupport boards with this structure and\nencourage change when this is not the case.\nHowever, board committee independence\nthresholds may vary depending on the market.\n\nDirector Overboarding\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\nclosely review director board commitments and\nwill vote against directors serving on more\nthan six total boards, for directors who are\nnot also executives; and against directors\nserving more than three total boards, for a\ndirector who serves as an executive of a\npublic company.\n                                              \n  Corporate Governance Focused Thematic       \n  Voting                                   5  \n  Policy Guidelines                           \n                                              \nClassified Boards\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy favors\nthe repeal of staggered boards in favor of the\nannual election of directors. Staggered boards\nare generally less accountable to shareholders\nthan annually elected directors to the board.\nIn addition, the annual election of directors\nencourages board members to focus on\nprotecting the interests of shareholders.\nFurther to this, if shareholders are\nunsatisfied with board members the annual\nelection of directors allows them to voice\nthese concerns.\n                                              \n   Financial                                  \n   Reporting                                  \n                                              \nAppointment of Auditors and Authority to Set\nFees\n\nThe role of the auditor is crucial in\nprotecting shareholder value. Like directors,\nauditors should be free from conflicts of\ninterest and should assiduously avoid\nsituations that require them to make choices\nbetween their own interests and the interests\nof the shareholders.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\ngenerally support the ratification of the\nauditor and approval to set the audit fees,\nexcept in cases where non-auditfees are\ngreater than half of the total fees, or there\nhas been an egregious oversight by the auditor\nthat comprises the integrity of their audit or\nindependence.\n\nCompensation\n\nCompensation Reports and Compensation Policies\n\nAs a general rule, shareholders should not\nseek to micromanage executive compensation\nprograms. Such matters should be left to the\nboard\u0092s compensation committee. The election\nof directors, and specifically those who sit\non the compensation committee, is viewed as\nanappropriate mechanism for shareholders to\nexpress their support, or disapproval, of\nboard policy on this issue. Further, companies\nwhose pay-for-performanceis in line with their\npeers should be granted the flexibility to\ncompensate their executives in a manner that\ndrives sustainablegrowth. The Corporate\nGovernance Focused Policy favors performance-\nbased compensation as an effective means of\nmotivating executives to act in the best\ninterests of shareholders.\n\nDepending on the market, compensation report\nand compensation policy vote proposals may be\neither advisory or binding, e.g. in the UK a\nnon-bindingcompensation report based upon the\nmost recent fiscal year is voted upon\nannually, and a forward-looking compensation\npolicy will be subject to a binding vote every\nthree years.\n\nIn all markets, company filings are evaluated\nclosely to determine how well information\npertinent to compensation practices has been\ndisclosed, the extent to which overall\ncompensation is tied to performance, which\nperformance metrics have been employed, as\nwell as how the company\u0092s remuneration\npractices compare to that of its peers.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\nvote against the approval of a compensation\nreport or policy in instances where the\ncompany has poor financial performance over\nthe previous three-year period, there is a\nsevere and sustained disconnect between\nexecutive pay and performance, and Glass Lewis\nbelieves that the compensation plan or policy\ndoes not warrant shareholder support.\n                                              \n  Corporate Governance Focused Thematic       \n  Voting                                   6  \n  Policy Guidelines                           \n                                              \nLong-Term Incentive Plans\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy\nrecognizes the value of equity-based incentive\nprograms. When used appropriately, they\nprovide a means of linking an employee\u0092s pay\nto a company\u0092s performance, thereby aligning\ntheir interests with those of shareholders. In\naddition, equity-based compensation is an\neffective way to attract, retain and motivate\nkey employees.\n\nIn order to allow for meaningful shareholder\nreview, incentive programs should generally\ninclude:\n                                              \n  \u00b7    specific and appropriate performance   \n       goals;                                 \n                                              \n                                  \n  \u00b7    a maximum award pool; and  \n                                  \n                                             \n  \u00b7    a maximum award amount per employee.  \n                                             \nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy\ngenerally supports the adoption of and\namendment to equity-based incentive programs\nexcept in cases where adoption of the proposal\nwould result in significant dilution to\nshareholders. In these instances, the size of\nthe company is taken into consideration when\ndetermining the appropriate level of dilution.\nFor example, small cap companies may be\nafforded a larger degree of dilution given the\nunique needs to attract and retain talent\nthrough equity-based programs, whereas large\ncap companies are expected to craft incentive\nplans where dilution does not exceed 20%.\n\nPerformance-Based Equity Compensation\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy\nsupports performance-based equity compensation\nplans for senior executives; where it is\nwarranted by both their performance, and that\nof the company. While it is not uncommon for a\nboard to state that tying equity compensation\nto performance goals may hinder them in\nattracting, and retaining, talented\nexecutives, the Corporate Governance Focused\nPolicy takes the stance that performance-based\ncompensation aids in aligning executive\ninterests to that of shareholders, and as such\nwill support the company in achieving its\nobjectives.\n                                              \n  Corporate Governance Focused Thematic       \n  Voting                                   7  \n  Policy Guidelines                           \n                                              \nGovernance Structure\n\nAmendments to the Articles of Association\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\nevaluate proposed amendments to a company\u0092s\narticles of association on a case-by-\ncasebasis. In cases where the article\namendments are bundled, the Corporate\nGovernance Focused Policy will evaluate each\namendment individually and may recommend\nagainst the proposal if, in the aggregate, the\namendments are not in the best interests of\nshareholders.\n\nAnti-Takeover Devices\n\nDual-Class Share Structure\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy views\ndual-class share structures as not in the best\ninterests of shareholders and instead is in\nfavor of one vote per share. This structure\noperates as a safeguard for common\nshareholders by ensuring that those who hold a\nsignificant minority of shares are still able\nto weigh in on issues set forth by the board.\nThe economic stake of each shareholder should\nmatch their voting power and that no small\ngroup of shareholders, family or otherwise,\nshould have differing voting rights from those\nof all other shareholders.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy\nconsiders a dual-class share structure as\nhaving the potential to negatively impact the\noverall corporate governance of a company.\nCompanies should have share class structures\nthat protect the interests of non-\ncontrollingshareholders as well as any\ncontrolling entity. Therefore, the Corporate\nGovernance Focused Policy will generally vote\nin favor of proposals to eliminate dual-class\nshare structures. Similarly, the Corporate\nGovernance Focused Policy will typically vote\nagainst proposals to adopt a new class of\ncommon stock.\n\nCumulative Voting\n\nCumulative voting increases the ability of\nminority shareholders to elect a director by\nallowing shareholders to cast as many shares\nof stock they own multiplied by the number of\ndirectors to be elected. Cumulative voting\nallows shareholders to cast all their votes\nfor one single nominee, or a smaller number of\nnominees than up for election, thereby raising\nthe likelihood of electing one or more of\ntheir preferred nominees to the board.\nAccordingly, cumulative voting generally acts\nas a safeguard for shareholders by ensuring\nthat those who hold a significant minority of\nshares can elect a candidate of their choosing\nto the board. The Corporate Governance Focused\nPolicy will generally oppose the adoption of\ncumulative voting unless the company has not\nadopted any form of majority voting, has\nadopted anti-takeover provisions, and has been\nhistorically unresponsive to shareholders.\n\nIn instances where a company has not adopted\nmajority voting standards and is facing both a\nproposal on the adoption of majority voting\nand a proposal to adopt cumulative voting, the\nCorporate Governance Focused Policy will\nsupport only the majority voting proposal.\n\nFair Price Provision\n\nFair price provisions, which are rare, require\ncertain minimum price and procedural\nrequirements to be observed by any party that\nacquires more than a specified percentage of a\ncorporation\u0092s common stock. The intention of\nthis provision is to protect minority\nshareholder value when an acquirer seeks to\naccomplish a\n                                              \n  Corporate Governance Focused Thematic       \n  Voting                                   8  \n  Policy Guidelines                           \n                                              \nmerger or other transaction which would\neliminate or change the rights of the\nshareholder. Fair price provisions sometimes\nprotect the rights of shareholders in a\ntakeover situation. However, more often than\nnot they act as an impediment to takeovers,\npotentially limiting gains to shareholders\nfrom a variety of transactions that could\npotentially increase share price. As a result,\nthe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\ngenerally vote to remove fair price\nprovisions.\n\nSupermajority Vote Requirements\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy favors\na simple majority voting structure except\nwhere a supermajority voting requirement is\nexplicitly intended to protect the rights of\nminority shareholders in a controlled company.\nIn the case of non-controlledcompanies,\nsupermajority vote requirements act as\nimpediments to shareholder action on ballot\nitems that are critical to their interests.\nFor example, supermajority vote requirements\ncan strongly limit the voice of shareholders\nin making decisions on critical matters such\nas the selling of the business. Supermajority\nvote requirements can also allow small groups\nof shareholders to overrule and dictate the\nwill of the majority of shareholders. Thus,\nhaving a simple majority is appropriate for\nprotecting the rights of all shareholders.\n\nPoison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plan)\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\ngenerally oppose companies\u0092 adoption of poison\npills, as they can reduce management\naccountability by substantially limiting\nopportunities for corporate takeovers. As a\nresult, rights plans can prevent shareholders\nfrom receiving a buy-outpremium for their\nstock. Generally, the Corporate Governance\nFocused Policy will vote against these plans\nto protect shareholders\u0092 financial interests.\nWhile boards should be given wide latitude in\ndirecting the activities of the company and\ncharting the company\u0092s course, on an issue\nsuch as this where the link between the\nfinancial interests of shareholders and their\nright to consider and accept buyout offers is\nso substantial, shareholders should be allowed\nto vote on whether or not they support such a\nplan\u0092s implementation. In certain limited\ncircumstances, the Corporate Governance\nFocused Policy will support a limited poison\npill to accomplish a particular objective,\nsuch as the closing of an important merger, or\na pill that contains what we believe to be a\nreasonable \u0091qualifying offer\u0092 clause.\n\nIncrease in Authorized Shares\n\nAdequate capital stock is important to a\ncompany\u0092s operation. When analyzing a request\nfor additional shares, the Corporate\nGovernance Focused Policy will typically\nreview four common reasons why a company may\nneed additional capital stock: (i) stock\nsplit; (ii) shareholder defenses; (iii)\nfinancing for acquisitions; and (iv) financing\nfor operations.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy\nbelieves that having adequate shares to allow\nmanagement to make quick decisions and\neffectively operate the business is critical.\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy favors\nthat, when a company is undertaking\nsignificant transactions, management will\njustify its use of additional shares rather\nthan providing a blank check in the form of\nlarge pools of unallocated shares available\nfor any purpose. The Corporate Governance\nFocused Policy will support proposals to\nincrease authorized shares up to 100% of the\nnumber of shares currently authorized unless,\nafter the increase the company would be left\nwith less than 30% of its authorized shares\noutstanding. In markets where such authorities\ntypically also authorize the board to issue\nnew shares without separate shareholder\napproval, the Corporate Governance Focused\nPolicy applies the policy described below on\nthe issuance of shares.\n                                              \n  Corporate Governance Focused Thematic       \n  Voting                                   9  \n  Policy Guidelines                           \n                                              \nIssuance of Shares\n\nGenerally, the Corporate Governance Focused\nPolicy will support proposals to authorize the\nboard to issue shares (with pre-emptiverights)\nup to 100% of issued share capital. The\nauthority of these shares should not exceed\nfive years unless that is the market best\npractice. In accordance with the different\nmarket practices, the specific thresholds for\nshare issuance can vary. As a result, the\nCorporate Governance Focused Policy will vote\non these proposals on a case-by-casebasis.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\nalso generally support proposals to suspend\npre-emptionrights for a maximum of 5-20%of the\nissued ordinary share capital of the company,\ndepending on best practice in the country in\nwhich the company is located. This authority\nshould not exceed five years, or less for some\ncountries.\n\nRepurchase of Shares\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy\ntypically supports proposals to repurchase\nshares when the plan includes the following\nprovisions:\n                                              \n  (i)    A maximum number of shares which     \n         may be purchased; and                \n                                              \n                                              \n          A maximum price which may be paid   \n  (ii)    for each share (as a percentage of  \n          the market price).                  \n                                              \nReincorporation\n\nA company is in the best position to determine\nthe appropriate jurisdiction of incorporation.\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\nfactor in several elements when a management\nproposal to reincorporate the company is put\nto vote. These elements include reviewing the\nrelevant financial benefits, generally related\nto incorporate tax treatment, as well as\nchanges in corporate governance provisions,\nespecially those related to shareholder\nrights, resulting from the change in domicile.\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements\n\nTypically, the Corporate Governance Focused\nPolicy will vote against provisions that would\nrequire advance notice of shareholder\nproposals or of director nominees. Advance\nnotice requirements typically range between\nthree to six months prior to the annual\nmeeting. These requirements often make it\nimpossible for a shareholder who misses the\ndeadline to present a shareholder proposal or\ndirector nominee that may be in the best\ninterests of the company. Shareholders should\nbe able to review and vote on all proposals\nand director nominees and are able to vote\nagainst proposals that appear with little\nprior notice. Therefore, by setting advance\nnotice requirements it limits the opportunity\nfor shareholders to raise issues that may\narise after the window closes.\n\nAnti-Greenmail Proposals\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\nsupport proposals to adopt a provision\npreventing the payment of greenmail, which\nwould serve to prevent companies from buying\nback company stock at significant premiums\nfrom a certain shareholder. The anti-greenmail\nprovision helps to protect the company as it\nrequires that a majority of shareholders other\nthan the majority shareholder approve the\nbuyback, thus, eliminating cases where a\nmajority shareholder could attempt to charge a\nboard a large premium for the shares.\n                                              \n  Corporate Governance Focused                \n  Thematic Voting                         10  \n  Policy Guidelines                           \n                                              \nVirtual-Only Shareholder Meetings\n\nA growing number of companies have elected to\nhold shareholder meetings by virtual means\nonly. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy\nsupports companies allowing a virtual option\nalongside an in-personmeeting, so long as the\nshareholder interests are not compromised.\nWithout proper controls, conducting a virtual-\nonly meeting of shareholders could eliminate\nor significantly limit the rights of\nshareholders to confront, and ask management\non any concerns they may have. When companies\ndecide to only hold virtual-only meetings, the\nCorporate Governance Focused Policy will\nexamine the level of disclosure assuring that\nshareholders will be afforded the same rights\nand opportunities to participate as they would\nat an in-personmeeting.\n\nMerger, Acquisitions and Contested Meetings\n\nFor merger and acquisition proposals, the\nCorporate Governance Focused Policy undertakes\na thorough examination of all elements of the\ntransactions and determine the transaction\u0092s\nlikelihood of maximizing shareholder return.\nIn order to make a voting recommendation, the\nCorporate Governance Focused Policy will\nexamine the process conducted, the specific\nparties and individuals involved in\nnegotiating an agreement, as well as the\neconomic and governance terms of the proposal.\n\nIn the case of contested merger situations, or\nboard proxy fights, the Corporate Governance\nFocused Policy will evaluate the plan\npresented by the dissident party and how, if\nelected, it plans to enhance or protect\nshareholder value. The Corporate Governance\nFocused Policy will also consider any concerns\npresented by the board, including any plans\nfor improving the performance of the company,\nwhen making the ultimate recommendation. In\naddition, the Corporate Governance Focused\nPolicy will support shareholder proposals\nasking a company to consider the effects of a\nmerger, spin-off,or other transaction on its\nemployees and other stakeholders.\n\nShareholder Proposals\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy has a\nstrong emphasis on electing a qualified board\nto manage the strategic direction of the\ncompany. The Corporate Governance Focused\nPolicy believes that directors who are\nconscientiously exercising their fiduciary\nduties will typically have more and better\ninformation about the Company and its\nsituation than shareholders. Those directors\nare also charged with making business\ndecisions and overseeing management. The\ndefault view, therefore, is that the board and\nmanagement, absent a suspicion of illegal or\nunethical conduct, will make decisions that\nare in the best interests of shareholders.\nShareholder proposals are carefully reviewed\nto determine if the action or report requested\nis necessary in light of the company\u0092s current\npractices.\n\nGovernance Proposals\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy\nsupports increased shareholder participation\nand access to a company and its board of\ndirectors. Accordingly, the Corporate\nGovernance Focused Policy will vote in favor\nof initiatives that seek to enhance\nshareholder rights, such as the introduction\nof majority voting to elect\n                                              \n  Corporate Governance Focused                \n  Thematic Voting                         11  \n  Policy Guidelines                           \n                                              \ndirectors, the adoption of proxy access\nbylaws, the elimination/reduction of\nsupermajority provisions, the declassification\nof the board, the submission of shareholder\nrights\u0092 plans to a shareholder vote, and the\nprinciple of one share, one vote.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy will\nsupport shareholders\u0092 right to call a special\nmeeting and act by written consent; however,\nonly one of those provisions is necessary. As\nsuch, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy\nwill recommend against shareholder proposals\nto adopt special meeting or written consent\nprovisions where one such provision already\nexists. Similarly, the Corporate Governance\nFocused Policy will support the board-\nsponsored special meeting or written consent\nproposal when competing management and\nshareholder proposals are on the same agenda.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy\ngenerally opposes shareholder proposals to\nseparate the role of chair and CEO, except in\nlimited circumstances where there is no\nindependent oversight of the board through a\nrole such as lead director, and where Glass\nLewis\u0092 review of the company\u0092s circumstances\nwarrants supporting the proposal.\n\nCompensation Proposals\n\nThe Corporate Governance Focused Policy does\nnot believe shareholders should be directly\ninvolved in the design and negotiation of\ncompensation packages. Such matters should be\nleft to the board\u0092s wholly-independent\ncompensation committee, which can be held\naccountable for its decisions through the\nelection of directors. Further, in many\nmarkets, shareholders have the opportunity to\nvoice their approval or dissatisfaction with\nrespect to Company\u0092s executive compensation\npolicies, practice, and disclosure through a\nvote on the company\u0092s executive compensation\nplan and policy. The board generally has more\nand better information concerning a company\u0092s\nstrategies and is thus in the best position to\ndetermine issues including the specifics of\nexecutive compensation plans and the\nprinciples that guide such compensation.\n\nGeneral Approach to Environmental and Social\nShareholder Proposals\n\nIn general, the Corporate Governance Focused\nPolicy believes it is prudent for management\nto assess its potential exposure to all risks,\nincluding environmental issues and regulations\npertaining thereto in order to incorporate\nthis information into its overall business\nrisk profile. However, the Corporate\nGovernance Focused Policy believes that the\nmanagement and reporting of environmental\nissues associated with business operations are\ngenerally best left to management and the\ndirectors who can be held accountable for\nfailure to address relevant risks on these\nissues when they face re-election.As such, the\nCorporate Governance Focused Policy will\ngenerally recommend in line with management on\nenvironmental and social issues.\n                                              \n  Corporate Governance Focused                \n  Thematic Voting                         12  \n  Policy Guidelines                           \n                                              \nConnect with Glass Lewis\n                                              \n  Corporate\u00a0Website    | www.glasslewis.com   \n  Email                | info@glasslewis.com  \n                       |                      \n  Social               @glasslewis            \n                       Glass, Lewis\u00a0& Co.     \n                                              \nGlobal Locations\n                                              \n             United                           \n             States                           \n             Headqua\u2026                         \n             100 Pine                         \n             Street,                          \n             Suite                            \n             1925 San                         \n             Francis\u2026              Ireland    \n             CA 94111              15 Henry   \n             +1 415                Street     \n             678 4110              Limerick   \n             New                   V94        \n             York, NY              V9T4 +353  \n             +1 646                61 534     \n             606 2345              343        \n             2323                  United     \n             Grand                 Kingdom    \n             Bouleva\u2026              80         \n             Suite                 Coleman    \n             1125                  Street     \n             Kansas                Suite      \n             City, MO              4.02       \n             64108                 London     \n             +1 816                EC2R 5BJ   \n  North      945 4525              +44 20     \n  America    Austral\u2026    Europe    7653 8800  \n  Asia       CGI                   France     \n  Pacific    Glass                 Proxinve\u2026  \n             Lewis                 6 Rue      \n             Suite                 d\u0092Uz\u00e8s      \n             5.03,                 75002      \n             Level\u00a05               Paris      \n             255                   +33 ()1    \n             George                45 51 50   \n             Street                43         \n             Sydney                Germany    \n             NSW 2000              IVOX       \n             +61 2                 Glass      \n             9299                  Lewis      \n             9266 \u00a0                Kaiseral\u2026  \n             Japan                 23a 76133  \n             Shinjuku              Karlsruhe  \n             Mitsui                +49 721    \n             Building              35 49622   \n             11th                             \n             floor                            \n             2-1-1,\u00a0                          \n             Nishi-S\u2026                         \n             Shinjuk\u2026                         \n             Tokyo                            \n             163-041\u2026                         \n             Japan                            \n                                              \n                                              \n  Corporate Governance Focused                \n  Thematic Voting                         13  \n  Policy Guidelines                           \n                                              \n                                              \n   DISCLAIMER                                 \n                                              \n\u00a9 2025 Glass, Lewis & Co., and/or its\naffiliates.

In voting their shares,\nfaith-based socially\nresponsible institutional shareholders are\nconcerned not only with sustainable economic\nreturns to shareholders and good corporate\ngovernance, but also with the ethical behavior\nof corporations and the social and\nenvironmental impact of their\nactions.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services has, therefore,\ndeveloped faith-based proxy voting guidelines\nfor Catholic and other Christian religious\ninstitutions that\nare consistent with the objectives of socially\nresponsible shareholders as well as the\nteachings of Catholicism and Christianity as a\nwhole. On matters of social and environmental\nimpact, the guidelines seek to reflect a broad\nconsensus of the\nfaith-based socially responsible investing\ncommunity. Generally, we take as our frame of\nreference policies and proposals promulgated\nby the Catholic Bishops\u0092 Pastoral on\neconomics, the Socially Responsible Investment\nGuidelines adopted by the\nBishops, and the policies developed by members\nof the Interfaith Center on Corporate\nResponsibility (ICCR).\n\nOn matters of corporate governance, executive\ncompensation, and corporate structure, these\nfaith-based proxy voting guidelines are based\non a commitment to create and preserve\neconomic value and to advance principles of\nbest practice corporate governance and\nshareholder rights, consistent with\nresponsibilities to society and the\nenvironment as a whole.\n\nThe guidelines provide an overview of Catholic\nAdvisory Services\u0092 faith-based proxy voting\npolicy for Catholic and other Christian\ndenomination institutions. We note there may\nbe cases in which the final vote\nrecommendation varies from the vote guideline\ndue to the fact that we closely examine the\nmerits of each proposal and consider\nrelevant information and company-specific\ncircumstances in arriving at our decisions.\nThese guidelines are revised on an annual\nbasis to take into account emerging issues and\ntrends on environmental, social and corporate\ngovernance topics, as well\nas the evolution of market standards,\nregulatory changes and client feedback.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C    3\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                   \n                                              \n                            \n  1.    Board of Directors  \n                            \nA corporation\u0092s board of directors sits at the\napogee of\nthe corporate governance system. Though they\nnormally delegate responsibility for the\nmanagement of the business to the senior\nexecutives they select and oversee, directors\nbear ultimate responsibility for the conduct\nof the corporation\u0092s\nbusiness. The role of directors in publicly\nheld corporations has undergone considerable\nchange in recent years. Once derided as rubber\nstamps for management, directors of public\ncorporations today are expected to serve as\neffective guardians of\nshareholders\u0092 interests.\n\nVoting on directors and board-related issues\nis the most important use of the shareholder\nfranchise, not simply a routine proxy\nitem. Although uncontested director elections\ndo not present alternative nominees from whom\nto choose, a high percentage of opposition\nvotes is an expression of shareholder\ndissatisfaction and should be sufficient to\nelicit a meaningful response\nfrom management.\n\nThe role and responsibilities of directors has\nincreasingly been the subject of much\ndiscussion and debate, given the current\neconomic climate\nand the difficulties many companies now face\nin their respective markets. Influential\norganizations, including the American Law\nInstitute, the American Bar Association, the\nNational Association of Corporate Directors,\nand the Business Roundtable\nhave issued reports and recommendations\nregarding the duties and accountability of\ncorporate boards. Both mainstream and\nalternative media outlets have highlighted the\nnumerous gaps within risk oversight of company\nboards and individual directors,\nand many institutional investors, in response,\nhave capitalized on their rights as\nstakeholders to prompt changes. Corporations\nhave taken notice, implementing many of the\nreforms championed by their shareholders.\n\nAlthough differences of opinion remain, a\nfairly strong consensus has emerged on a\nnumber of key issues. It is widely agreed that\nthe board\u0092s most important\nresponsibility is to ensure that the\ncorporation is managed in the shareholders\u0092\nbest long-term economic interest. This will\noften require boards to consider the impact of\ntheir actions on other constituencies,\nincluding employees, customers,\nlocal communities, and the environment.\n                                              \n       The board\u0092s principal functions are     \n  \u220e    widely agreed to consist of the        \n       following:                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       To select, evaluate, and if            \n  \u220e    necessary, replace management,         \n       including the chief executive          \n       officer;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    To review and approve major            \n       strategies and financial objectives;   \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    To advise management on significant    \n       issues;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       To assure that effective controls are  \n  \u220e    in place to safeguard corporate        \n       assets, manage risk, and comply with   \n       the law; and                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       To nominate directors and otherwise    \n  \u220e    ensure that the board functions        \n       effectively.                           \n                                              \nBoards are expected to have a majority of\ndirectors independent of management. The\nindependent directors are expected to organize\nmuch of the board\u0092s work, even\nif the chief executive officer also serves as\nChair of the board. Key committees of the\nboard are expected to be entirely independent\nof management. It is expected that boards will\nengage in critical self-evaluation of\nthemselves and of individual\nmembers. Individual directors, in turn, are\nexpected to devote significant amounts of time\nto their duties, to limit the number of\ndirectorships they accept, and to own a\nmeaningful amount of stock in companies on\nwhose boards they serve. Directors\nare ultimately responsible to the\ncorporation\u0092s shareholders. The most direct\nexpression of this responsibility is the\nrequirement that directors be elected to their\npositions by the shareholders. Shareholders\nare also asked to vote on a number\nof other matters regarding the role,\nstructure, and composition of the board.\nCatholic Advisory Services classifies\ndirectors as either executive, non-independent\nnon-executive, or independent directors.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C    4\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                   \n                                              \nUncontested Election of Directors\n\nFour broad principles apply when determining\nvotes on director nominees:\n                                              \n        Board Accountability: Accountability  \n        refers to the promotion of            \n        transparency into a company\u0092s          \n        governance practices and annual       \n        board elections and the provision to  \n  1.    shareholders the ability to remove    \n        problematic directors and to vote on  \n        takeover defenses or other            \n        charter/bylaw amendments.

Current interim officers are\nincluded in this category. For private\ncompanies, the equivalent positions are\napplicable. A non-employee director serving as\nan officer due to statutory requirements\n(e.g. corporate secretary) will generally be\nclassified as a Non-Independent Non-Executive\nDirector under \u0093Any material relationship with\nthe company.\u0094\nHowever, if the company provides explicit\ndisclosure that the director is not receiving\nadditional compensation exceeding $10,000 per\nyear for serving in that capacity, then the\ndirector will be classified as an Independent\nDirector.\n\nii\u0093Affiliate\u0094 includes a subsidiary, sibling\ncompany, or parent company.\nCatholic Advisory Services uses 50 percent\ncontrol ownership by the parent company as the\nstandard for applying its affiliate\ndesignation. The manager/advisor of an\nexternally managed issuer (EMI) is considered\nan affiliate.\n\niii Includes any former CEO of the company\nprior to the company\u0092s initial\npublic offering (IPO).\n\niv When there is a former CEO of a special\npurpose\nacquisition company (SPAC) serving on the\nboard of an acquired company, Catholic\nAdvisory Services will generally classify such\ndirectors as independent unless determined\notherwise taking into account the following\nfactors: the applicable listing\nstandards determination of such director\u0092s\nindependence; any operating ties to the firm;\nand the existence of any other conflicting\nrelationships or related party transactions.\n\nvCatholic Advisory Services will look at the\nterms of the interim officer\u0092s\nemployment contract to determine if it\ncontains severance pay, long-term health and\npension benefits, or other such standard\nprovisions typically contained in contracts of\npermanent, non-temporary CEOs.\nCatholic Advisory Services will also consider\nif a formal search process was under way for a\nfull-time officer at the time.\n\nvi\u0093Immediate family member\u0094 follows the SEC\u0092s\ndefinition of such and covers spouses,\nparents, children, step-parents, step-\nchildren, siblings,\nin-laws, and any person (other than a tenant\nor employee) sharing the household of any\ndirector, nominee for director, executive\nofficer, or significant shareholder of the\ncompany.\n\nvii Professional services can be characterized\nas advisory in nature, generally\ninvolve access to sensitive company\ninformation or to strategic decision-making,\nand typically have a commission- or fee-based\npayment structure. Professional services\ngenerally include, but are not limited to\nthe following: investment banking/financial\nadvisory services; commercial banking (beyond\ndeposit services); investment services;\ninsurance services; accounting/audit services;\nconsulting services; marketing services; legal\nservices; property\nmanagement services; realtor services;\nlobbying services; executive search services;\nand IT consulting services. The following\nwould generally be considered transactional\nrelationships and not professional services:\ndeposit services; IT tech support\nservices; educational services; and\nconstruction services. The case of\nparticipation in a banking syndicate by a non-\nlead bank should be considered a transactional\n(and hence subject to the associated\nmateriality test) rather than a professional\nrelationship. \u0093Of Counsel\u0094 relationships are\nonly considered immaterial if the individual\ndoes not receive any form of compensation (in\nexcess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a\nretired partner\nof, the firm providing the professional\nservice. The case of a company providing a\nprofessional service to one of its directors\nor to an entity with which one of its\ndirectors is affiliated, will be considered a\ntransactional rather than a\nprofessional relationship. Insurance services\nand marketing services are assumed to be\nprofessional services unless the company\nexplains why such services are not advisory.\n\nviii A material transactional relationship,\nincluding grants to non-profit organizations,\nexists if the company makes annual payments\nto, or receives annual payments from, another\nentity exceeding the greater of $200,000 or 5\npercent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues,\nin the case of a company which follows NASDAQ\nlisting standards; or the greater of\n$1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient\u0092s\ngross revenues, in the case of a company which\nfollows NYSE listing standards. In the case of\na company which\nfollows neither of the preceding standards,\nCatholic Advisory Services will apply the\nNASDAQ-based materiality test. (The recipient\nis the party receiving the financial proceeds\nfrom the transaction).\n\nix Dissident directors who are parties to a\nvoting agreement\npursuant to a settlement or similar\narrangement may be classified as Independent\nDirectors if an analysis of the following\nfactors indicates that the voting agreement\ndoes not compromise their alignment with all\nshareholders\u0092 interests: the\nterms of the agreement; the duration of the\nstandstill provision in the agreement; the\nlimitations and requirements of actions that\nare agreed upon; if the dissident director\nnominee(s) is subject to the standstill; and\nif there any conflicting\nrelationships or related party transactions.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    13\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nxInterlocks include: executive officers\nserving as directors on\neach other\u0092s compensation or similar\ncommittees (or, in the absence of such a\ncommittee, on the board); or executive\nofficers sitting on each other\u0092s boards and at\nleast one serves on the other\u0092s compensation\nor similar committees\n(or, in the absence of such a committee, on\nthe board).\n\nxi The operating\ninvolvement of the founder with the company\nwill be considered; if the founder was never\nemployed by the company, Catholic Advisory\nServices may deem him or her an Independent\nDirector.\n\nxii For purposes of Catholic Advisory\nServices\u0092 director\nindependence classification, \u0093material\u0094 will\nbe defined as a standard of relationship\n(financial, personal or otherwise) that a\nreasonable person might conclude could\npotentially influence one\u0092s objectivity in the\nboardroom in a\nmanner that would have a meaningful impact on\nan individual\u0092s ability to satisfy requisite\nfiduciary standards on behalf of shareholders.\n                                              \n   Board-Related Management Proposals         \n                                              \nClassification/Declassification of the Board\n\nUnder a classified board structure only one\nclass of directors would stand for election\neach year, and the directors in each class\nwould generally serve three-year\nterms. Although staggered boards can provide\ncontinuity for companies at the board level,\nthere are also a number of downsides to the\nstructure. First, a classified board can also\nbe used to entrench management and effectively\npreclude most takeover\nbids or proxy contests. Board classification\nforces dissidents and would-be acquirers to\nnegotiate with the incumbent board, which has\nthe authority to decide on offers without a\nshareholder vote. In addition,\nwhen a board is classified, it is difficult to\nremove individual members for either poor\nattendance or poor performance; shareholders\nwould only have the chance to vote on a given\ndirector every third year when he or she comes\nup for election. The\nclassified board structure can also limit\nshareholders\u0092 ability to withhold votes from\ninside directors that sit on key board\ncommittee, or to withhold votes from an entire\nboard slate to protest the lack of board\ndiversity. According to\nISS\u0092 2012 Board Practices study, the number of\nS&P 500 companies with classified boards has\ncontinued to fall. In 2015, only 17 percent of\nS&P 500 companies maintained staggered boards,\ncompared to 2 percent in 2014,\n30 percent in 2013, 41 percent in 2009 and 53\npercent in 2005. While we recognize that there\nare some advantages to classified boards,\nbased on the latest studies on classified\nboards, the fact that classified boards can\nmake it more\ndifficult for shareholders to remove\nindividual directors, and the fact that\nclassified boards can be used as an\nantitakeover device, Catholic Advisory\nServices recommends against the adoption of\nclassified boards.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for proposals to repeal           \n  \u220e    classified boards and to elect all     \n       directors annually.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote against proposals to classify     \n       (stagger) the board of directors.      \n                                              \nMajority Vote Threshold for Director Elections\n\nCatholic Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote for management\nproposals to adopt a majority of votes cast\nstandard for directors in uncontested\nelections.\n\nVote against if no\ncarve-out for plurality in contested elections\nis included.\n\nCumulative Voting\n\nMost corporations provide that shareholders\nare entitled to cast one vote for each share\nowned. Under a cumulative voting scheme the\nshareholder is permitted to have\none vote per share for each director to be\nelected. Shareholders are permitted to\napportion those votes in any manner they wish\namong the director candidates. Shareholders\nhave the opportunity to elect a minority\nrepresentative to a board through\ncumulative voting, thereby ensuring\nrepresentation for all sizes of shareholders.\nFor example, if there is a company with a ten-\nmember board and 500 shares outstanding\u0097the\ntotal number of votes that may\nbe cast is 5,000. In this case a shareholder\nwith 51 shares (10.2 percent of the\noutstanding shares) would be guaranteed one\nboard seat because all votes may be cast for\none candidate.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    14\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nCatholic Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote\nagainstmanagement proposals to eliminate\ncumulative voting, and for shareholder\nproposals to restore or provide for cumulative\nvoting unless:\n                                              \n       The company has proxy                  \n  \u220e    access12, thereby allowing             \n       shareholders to nominate directors to  \n       the company\u0092s ballot; and               \n                                              \n                                              \n       The company has adopted a majority     \n       vote standard, with a carve-out for    \n       plurality                              \n  \u220e    voting in situations where there are   \n       more nominees than seats, and a        \n       director resignation policy to         \n       address failed elections.              \n                                              \nVote for\nproposals for cumulative voting at controlled\ncompanies (insider voting power > 50%).\n\nDirector and Officer Indemnification,\nLiability Protection, and Exculpation\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon proposals on director and\nofficer indemnification, liability protection,\nand exculpation 13 .\n\nConsider the stated rationale for the proposed\nchange.

Many\ncompanies have sought shareholder approval for\ncharter or bylaw amendments that would\nprohibit the removal of directors except for\ncause, thus ensuring that directors would\nretain their directorship for their\nfull-term unless found guilty of self-dealing.\nBy requiring cause to be demonstrated through\ndue process, management insulates the\ndirectors from removal even if a director has\nbeen performing poorly, not attending\nmeetings, or not acting in the\nbest interests of shareholders.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote against proposals that provide    \n  \u220e    that directors may be removed only     \n       for cause.                             \n                                              \n12 A proxy access right that meets the\nrecommended guidelines.\n\n13 Indemnification: the condition of being\nsecured against loss or damage.\n\nLimited liability: a\nperson\u0092s financial liability is limited to a\nfixed sum, or personal financial assets are\nnot at risk if the individual loses a lawsuit\nthat results in financial award/damages to the\nplaintiff.\n\nExculpation: to eliminate or limit the\npersonal liability of a director or officer to\nthe corporation or its shareholders for\nmonetary damages for breach of\nfiduciary duty as a director or officer.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    15\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for proposals to restore          \n  \u220e    shareholder ability to remove          \n       directors with or without cause.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against proposals that provide    \n  \u220e    that only continuing directors may     \n       elect replacements to fill board       \n       vacancies.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for proposals that permit         \n  \u220e    shareholders to elect directors to     \n       fill board vacancies.                  \n                                              \nBoard Size\n\nProposals which would allow\nmanagement to increase or decrease the size of\nthe board at its own discretion are often used\nby companies as a takeover defense. Catholic\nAdvisory Services supports management\nproposals to fix the size of the board at a\nspecific number, thus\npreventing management, when facing a proxy\ncontest, from increasing the board size\nwithout shareholder approval. By increasing\nthe size of the board, management can make it\nmore difficult for dissidents to gain control\nof the board. Fixing the size\nof the board also prevents a reduction in the\nsize of the board as a strategy to oust\nindependent directors. Fixing board size also\nprevents management from increasing the number\nof directors in order to dilute the effects of\ncumulative voting.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote for proposals that seek to fix    \n       the size of the board.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on proposals that    \n  \u220e    seek                                   \n       to change the size or range of the     \n       board.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against proposals that give       \n       management the ability to alter the    \n  \u220e    size of the board outside of a         \n       specific range                         \n       without shareholder approval.          \n                                              \nEstablish/Amend Nominee Qualifications\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon proposals that establish or\namend director qualifications.

Shareholders have\nexpressed strong support for shareholder\nproposals on majority threshold voting.\nCatholic Advisory Services believes\nshareholders should have a greater voice in\nthe\nelection of directors and believes majority\nthreshold voting represents a viable\nalternative to the plurality system in the\nU.S. Companies are strongly encouraged to also\nadopt a post-election policy (also known as a\ndirector resignation policy)\nthat will provide guidelines so that the\ncompany will promptly address the situation of\na holdover director.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor precatory and binding resolutions\nrequesting that the board change the company\u0092s\nbylaws to stipulate that directors need to be\nelected with an affirmative majority of votes\ncast, provided it does not conflict with the\nstate law where the company is incorporated.\nBinding resolutions need to allow for a carve-\noutfor a plurality vote standard when there\nare more nominees than board seats.\n\nMajority of Independent Directors\n\nCatholic\nAdvisory Services believes that a board\nindependent from management is of vital\nimportance to a company and its shareholders.\nAccordingly, Catholic Advisory Services will\ncast votes in a manner that shall encourage\nthe independence of boards.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    17\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n       that a majority or more of directors   \n       be independent unless the board        \n  \u220e    composition                            \n       already meets the proposed threshold   \n       by Catholic Advisory Services\u0092          \n       definition of independence (See        \n       Classification of Directors).          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals to      \n  \u220e    strengthen the definition of           \n       independence for board directors.      \n                                              \nEstablishment of Independent Committees\n\nMost corporate governance experts agree that\nthe key board committees (audit, compensation,\nand nominating/corporate governance) of a\ncorporation should include only\nindependent directors. The independence of key\ncommittees has been encouraged by regulation.\nCatholic Advisory Services believes that\ninitiatives to increase the independent\nrepresentation of these committees or to\nrequire that these committees be\nindependent should be supported.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals asking that board\naudit, compensation, and/or nominating\ncommittees be composed exclusively of\nindependent directors.\n\nIndependent Board Chair\n\nOne of the\nprinciple functions of the board is to monitor\nand evaluate the performance of the CEO. The\nchairperson\u0092s duty to oversee management is\nobviously compromised when he or she is\nrequired to monitor himself or herself; or\nwhen he or she is a non-independent director.\nGenerally Catholic Advisory Services\nrecommends a vote for shareholder proposals\nthat would require that the position of board\nchair be held by an individual with no\nmaterials ties to the\ncompany other than their board seat.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals that would require\nthe board chair to be independent of\nmanagement.\n\nEstablishment of Board Committees\n\nCatholic Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote for shareholder\nproposals to establish a new board committee\nto address broad corporate policy topics or to\nprovide a forum for ongoing dialogue on issues\nsuch as the environment, human or labor\nrights, shareholder relations, occupational\nhealth and safety etc. when the formation of\nsuch committees appears to be a potentially\neffective method of protecting or enhancing\nshareholder value.

While it is recognized that\nthe company is in the best position to\nevaluate the competence of the outside\naccountants, we believe that outside\naccountants must ultimately be accountable to\nshareholders.

Given the rash of\naccounting misdeeds that were not detected by\naudit panels or auditors, shareholder\nratification is an essential step\nin restoring investor confidence. Shareholders\nshould have the right to weigh in on the\nchoice of the audit firm, and all companies\nshould put ratification on the ballot of their\nannual meeting. Special consideration will be\ngiven when non-audit fees exceed audit fees,\nas high non-audit fees can compromise the\nindependence of the auditor.

Currently, SEC\nrules provide that partners should be rotated\nevery five years. However, Catholic Advisory\nServices also believes that the long tenure of\naudit firms at U.S. companies can be\nproblematic.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals to rotate company\u0092s\nauditor every five years or more. Catholic\nAdvisory Services believes that proposing a\nrotation period less than five years is\nunreasonably restrictive and may negatively\naffect audit quality and service while\nincreasing expense.\n                                              \n  3.    Takeover Defenses / Shareholder       \n        Rights                                \n                                              \nCorporate takeover attempts come in\nvarious guises. Usually, a would-be acquirer\nmakes a direct offer to the board of directors\nof a targeted corporation. The bidder may\noffer to purchase the company for cash and/or\nstock. If the board approves\nthe offer, a friendly transaction is completed\nand presented to shareholders for approval.\nIf, however, the board of directors rejects\nthe bid, the acquirer can make a tender offer\nfor the shares directly to the targeted\ncorporation\u0092s\nshareholders. Such offers are referred to as\nhostile tender bids.\n\nNot wishing to wait until they are subjects of\nhostile takeover attempts, many corporations\nhave adopted antitakeover measures designed to\ndeter unfriendly bids or buy time. The most\ncommon defenses are the shareholders rights\nprotection plan, also known as the poison\npill, and charter amendments that create\nbarriers to acceptance of\nhostile bids. In the U.S., poison pills do not\nrequire shareholder approval. However,\nshareholders must approve charter amendments,\nsuch as classified boards or supermajority\nvote requirements. In brief, the very\nexistence of defensive measures can\nforeclose the possibility of tenders and\nhence, opportunities to premium prices for\nshareholders.\n\nAnti-takeover statutes generally increase\nmanagement\u0092s\npotential for insulating itself and warding\noff hostile takeovers that may be beneficial\nto shareholders. While it may be true that\nsome boards use such devices to obtain higher\nbids and to enhance shareholder value, it is\nmore likely that such\nprovisions are used to entrench management.\nThe majority of historical evidence on\nindividual corporate anti-takeover measures\nindicates that heavily insulated companies\ngenerally realize lower returns than those\nhaving managements that are more\naccountable to shareholders and the market.\nThe evidence also suggests that when states\nadopt their own anti-takeover devices, or\nendorse those employed by firms, shareholder\nreturns are harmed. Moreover, the body of\nevidence appears to indicate\nthat companies in states with the strongest\nanti-takeover laws experience lower returns\nthan they would absent such statutes.\n\nTakeover Defenses and Shareholder Rights-\nRelated Management Proposals\n\nPoison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plans)\n\nPoison pills are corporate-sponsored financial\ndevices that, when triggered by potential\nacquirers, do one or more of the following: 1)\ndilute the acquirer\u0092s\nequity holdings in the target company; 2)\ndilute the acquirer\u0092s voting interests in the\ntarget company; or 3) dilute the acquirer\u0092s\nequity holdings in the post-merger company.\nPoison pills generally allow\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    21\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nshareholders to purchase shares from, or sell\nshares back to,\nthe target company (flip-in pill) and/or the\npotential acquirer (flip-out pill) at a price\nfar out of line with fair market value.\nDepending on the type of pill, the\ntriggering event can either transfer wealth\nfrom the target company or dilute the equity\nholdings of current shareholders. Poison pills\ninsulate management from the threat of a\nchange in control and provide the target board\nwith veto power over\ntakeover bids. Because poison pills greatly\nalter the balance of power between\nshareholders and management, shareholders\nshould be allowed to make their own evaluation\nof such plans.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon management proposals on poison\npill ratification, focusing on the features of\nthe shareholder rights plan. Rights plans\nshould contain the following attributes:\n                                              \n  \u220e    No lower than a 20\u00a0percent trigger,    \n       flip-in or flip-over provision;        \n                                              \n                                            \n  \u220e    A term of no more than three years;  \n                                            \n                                              \n       No deadhand, slowhand, no-hand or      \n  \u220e    similar feature that limits the        \n       ability of a                           \n       future board to redeem the pill;       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Shareholder redemption feature         \n       (qualifying offer clause); if the      \n       board refuses to redeem the pill 90    \n       days after a                           \n  \u220e    qualifying offer is announced, 10\u00a0     \n       percent of the shares may call a       \n       special meeting or seek a written      \n       consent to vote on rescinding the      \n       pill; and                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       In addition, the rationale for         \n       adopting the pill should be            \n       thoroughly explained by the company.   \n       In examining the request               \n  \u220e    for the pill, take into consideration  \n       the company\u0092s existing governance       \n       structure, including: board            \n       independence, existing takeover        \n       defenses, and any problematic          \n       governance concerns.                   \n                                              \nNet Operating Loss (NOL) Poison\nPills/Protective Amendments\n\nThe financial crisis has prompted widespread\nlosses in certain industries. This has\nresulted in previously profitable companies\nconsidering the adoption of a poison\npill and/or NOL protective amendment to\nprotect their NOL tax assets, which may be\nlost upon an acquisition of 5 percent of a\ncompany\u0092s shares.\n\nWhen\nevaluating management proposals seeking to\nadopt NOL pills or protective amendments, the\npurpose behind the proposal, its terms, and\nthe company\u0092s existing governance structure\nshould be taken into account to assess whether\nthe structure\nactively promotes board entrenchment or\nadequately protects shareholder rights. While\nCatholic Advisory Services acknowledges the\nhigh estimated tax value of NOLs, which\nbenefit shareholders, the ownership\nacquisition limitations contained in an NOL\npill/protective amendment coupled with a\ncompany\u0092s problematic governance structure\ncould serve as an antitakeover device.\n\nGiven the fact that shareholders\nwill want to ensure that such an amendment\ndoes not remain in effect permanently,\nCatholic Advisory Services will also closely\nreview whether the pill/amendment contains a\nsunset provision or a commitment to cause the\nexpiration of the NOL\npill/protective amendment upon exhaustion or\nexpiration of the NOLs.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nagainst proposals to adopt a poison pill for\nthe stated purpose of protecting a company\u0092s\nnet operating losses (\u0093NOLs\u0094) if the term of\nthe pill would exceed the shorter of three\nyears and the exhaustion of the NOL.\n\nVote case-by-case on\nmanagement proposals for poison pill\nratification, considering the following\nfactors, if the term of the pill would be the\nshorter of three years (or less) and the\nexhaustion of the NOL:\n                                              \n       The ownership threshold to transfer    \n  \u220e    (NOL pills generally have a trigger    \n       slightly below 5%);

Shareholders may lose the\nability to remove\ndirectors, initiate a shareholder resolution,\nor respond to a beneficial offer without\nhaving to wait for the next scheduled meeting\nif they are unable to act at a special meeting\nof their own calling.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Generally vote against proposals to    \n  \u220e    restrict or prohibit shareholders\u0092      \n       ability to take action by written      \n       consent.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for proposals to allow or         \n       facilitate shareholder action by       \n       written consent, taking into           \n       consideration: a)                      \n       shareholders\u0092 current right to act by   \n  \u220e    written consent; b) consent            \n       threshold; c) the inclusion of         \n       exclusionary or prohibitive language;  \n       d) Investor ownership structure; and   \n       e) shareholder support of and          \n       management\u0092s response to previous       \n       shareholder proposals.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on shareholder       \n       proposals if, in addition to the       \n       considerations above, the company has  \n       the following governance and           \n       antitakeover provisions; a) an         \n  \u220e    unfettered14 right for shareholders    \n       to call special meetings at a 10\u00a0      \n       percent threshold; b) a majority vote  \n       standard in uncontested                \n       director elections; c) no              \n       non-shareholder-approved pill, and;    \n       d) an annually elected board.          \n                                              \nAdvance Notice Requirements for Shareholder\nProposals/Nominations\n\nIn 2008, the Delaware courts handed down two\ndecisions, which,\nread together, indicate a judicial move toward\na narrower interpretation of companies\u0092\nadvance notice bylaws. These recent court\ndecisions have encouraged companies to take a\ncloser look at their bylaw provisions to\nensure that broad language\ndoes not provide loopholes for activist\ninvestors. Specifically, companies are\nincluding language designed to provide more\ndetailed advance notice provisions and to\nensure full disclosure of economic and voting\ninterests in a shareholder\u0092s\nnotice of proposals, including derivatives and\nhedged positions.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon advance notice proposals,\ngiving support to those proposals which allow\nshareholders to submit proposals/nominations\nas close to the meeting date as reasonably\npossible and within the broadest window\npossible, recognizing the need to allow\nsufficient notice for company, regulatory and\nshareholder review.\n\n14 \u0093Unfettered\u0094 means no restrictions on\nagenda items, no restrictions on the number of\nshareholders who can group together to reach\nthe 10 percent threshold, and only\nreasonable limits on when a meeting can be\ncalled: no greater than 30 days after the last\nannual meeting and no greater than 90 prior to\nthe next annual meeting.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    24\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nTo be reasonable, the company\u0092s deadline for\nshareholder\nnotice of a proposal/ nominations must be no\nearlier than 120 days prior to the anniversary\nof the previous year\u0092s meeting and have a\nsubmittal window of no shorter than 30 days\nfrom the beginning of the notice period (also\nknown as a 90-120 day window). The submittal\nwindow is the period under which a shareholder\nmust file their proposals/nominations prior to\nthe deadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by\ncompanies to ensure full disclosure in regard\nto a proponent\u0092s economic and voting position\nin the company so long as\nthe informational requirements are reasonable\nand aimed at providing shareholders with the\nnecessary information to review such\nproposals.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nFair price\nprovisions were originally designed to\nspecifically defend against the most coercive\nof takeover devises, the two-tiered, front-end\nloaded tender offer. In such a\nhostile takeover, the bidder offers cash for\nenough shares to gain control of the target.\nAt the same time the acquirer states that once\ncontrol has been obtained, the target\u0092s\nremaining shares will be purchased with cash,\ncash and securities\nor only securities. Since the payment offered\nfor the remaining stock is, by design less\nvaluable than the original offer for the\ncontrolling shares, shareholders are forced to\nsell out early to maximize their value.\nStandard fair price provisions\nrequire that, absent board or shareholder\napproval of the acquisition, the bidder must\npay the remaining shareholders the same price\nfor their shares that brought control.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on proposals to      \n       adopt                                  \n       fair price provisions evaluating       \n  \u220e    factors such as the vote required to   \n       approve the proposed acquisition, the  \n       vote required to repeal the fair       \n       price provision, and the mechanism     \n       for determining the fair price.        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Generally, vote against fair price     \n       provisions with shareholder vote       \n  \u220e    requirements greater than a majority   \n       of disinterested                       \n       shares.                                \n                                              \nGreenmail\n\nGreenmail payments are targeted share\nrepurchases by management of company stock\nfrom individuals or groups seeking control of\nthe company. Since only the hostile\nparty receives payment, usually at a\nsubstantial premium over the market value of\nshares, the practice discriminates against\nmost shareholders. This transferred cash,\nabsent the greenmail payment, could be put to\nmuch better use for reinvestment in\nthe company, payment of dividends, or to fund\na public share repurchase program.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for proposals to adopt            \n       antigreenmail charter or bylaw         \n  \u220e    amendments or otherwise restrict a     \n       company\u0092s                               \n       ability to make greenmail payments.    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Review on a case-by-case basis         \n  \u220e    antigreenmail proposals when they are  \n       bundled with other charter or bylaw    \n       amendments.                            \n                                              \nConfidential Voting\n\nConfidential voting, or voting by secret\nballot, is one of the key structural issues in\nthe proxy system. It ensures that all votes\nare based on the\nmerits of proposals and cast in the best\ninterests of fiduciary clients and pension\nplan beneficiaries. In a confidential voting\nsystem, only vote tabulators and inspectors of\nelection may examine individual proxies and\nballots; management and\nshareholders are given only vote totals. In an\nopen voting system, management can determine\nwho has voted against its nominees or\nproposals and then re-solicit those votes\nbefore the final vote count. As a\nresult, shareholders can be pressured to vote\nwith management at companies with which they\nmaintain, or would like to establish, a\nbusiness relationship. Confidential voting\nalso protects employee shareholders from\nretaliation. Shares held by\nemployee stock ownership plans, for example,\nare important votes that are typically voted\nby employees.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    25\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nformanagement proposals to adopt confidential\nvoting.\n\nControl Share Acquisition Provisions\n\nControl share acquisition statutes function by\ndenying shares their voting rights when they\ncontribute to ownership in excess of certain\nthresholds. Voting rights for those shares\nexceeding ownership limits may only be\nrestored by approval of either a majority or\nsupermajority of disinterested shares. Thus,\ncontrol share acquisition\nstatutes effectively require a hostile bidder\nto put its offer to a shareholder vote or risk\nvoting disenfranchisement if the bidder\ncontinues buying up a large block of shares.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for proposals to opt out of       \n       control share acquisition statutes     \n  \u220e    unless doing so would enable the       \n       completion of a                        \n       takeover that would be detrimental to  \n       shareholders.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against proposals to amend the    \n  \u220e    charter to include control share       \n       acquisition provisions.                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote for proposals to restore voting   \n       rights to the control shares.          \n                                              \nControl Share Cash-OutProvisions\n\nControl share cash-out statutes give dissident\nshareholders the right to\n\u0093cash-out\u0094 of their position in a company at\nthe expense of the shareholder who has taken a\ncontrol position. In other words, when an\ninvestor crosses a preset threshold level,\nremaining shareholders\nare given the right to sell their shares to\nthe acquirer, who must buy them at the highest\nacquiring price.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor proposals to opt out of control share\ncash-outstatutes.\n\nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or\npotential acquirer of more than a certain\npercentage of a company\u0092s stock to disgorge,\nor pay back, to the company\nany profits realized from the sale of that\ncompany\u0092s stock purchased 24 months before\nachieving control status. All sales of company\nstock by the acquirer occurring within a\ncertain period of time (between 18 months and\n24 months) prior to the\ninvestor\u0092s gaining control status are subject\nto these recapture-of-profits provisions.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor proposals to opt out of state disgorgement\nprovisions.\n\nState Takeover Statutes\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon proposals to opt in or out of\nstate takeover statutes (including control\nshare acquisition statutes, control share\ncash-outstatutes, freezeout provisions, fair\nprice provisions, stakeholder laws, poison\npill endorsements, severance pay and labor\ncontract provisions, antigreenmail provisions,\nand disgorgement provisions).\n\nVote for opting into stakeholder protection\nstatutes if they provide comprehensive\nprotections for employees and community\nstakeholders. Catholic Advisory\nServices would be less supportive of takeover\nstatutes that only serve to protect incumbent\nmanagement from accountability to shareholders\nand which negatively influence shareholder\nvalue.\n\nFreeze-OutProvisions\n\nFreeze-out provisions force an investor who\nsurpasses a certain ownership threshold in a\ncompany to wait a specified period of\ntime before gaining control of the company.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    26\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor proposals to opt out of state freeze-\noutprovisions.\n\nReincorporation Proposals\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon proposals to change a company\u0092s\nstate of incorporation giving consideration to\nboth financial and corporate governance\nconcerns including the following:\n                                     \n  \u220e    Reasons for reincorporation;

The debate\nover antitakeover devices centers on whether\nthese devices enhance or detract from\nshareholder value. One theory argues that a\ncompany\u0092s board, when armed with these\ntakeover protections, may use\nthem as negotiating tools to obtain a higher\npremium for shareholders. The opposing view\nmaintains that managements afforded such\nprotection are more likely to become\nentrenched than to actively pursue the best\ninterests of shareholders. Such\ntakeover defenses also serve as obstacles to\nthe normal functioning of the marketplace\nwhich, when operating efficiently, should\nreplace incapable and poorly performing\nmanagements.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nforshareholder proposals that seek to remove\nantitakeover provisions.\n\nReimburse Proxy Solicitation Expenses\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon proposals to reimburse proxy\nsolicitation expenses.

In instances where the\njoint effect of the conditioned items is not\nin shareholders\u0092 best interests, vote against\nthe proposals. If the combined effect is\npositive, support such proposals.\n\nAdjourn Meeting\n\nCompanies may ask\nshareholders to adjourn a meeting in order to\nsolicit more votes. Generally, shareholders\nalready have enough information to make their\nvote decisions. Once their votes have been\ncast, there is no justification for spending\nmore money to continue\npressing shareholders for more votes.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Generally vote against proposals to    \n       provide management with the authority  \n  \u220e    to adjourn an annual or special        \n       meeting absent                         \n       compelling reasons to support the      \n       proposal.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for proposals that relate         \n       specifically to soliciting votes for   \n       a merger or transaction if supporting  \n  \u220e    that merger or                         \n       transaction.

In\naddition, some brokerage houses have a policy\nof not monitoring or investing in very low\npriced shares.

The terms of blank check preferred\nstock give the board of\ndirectors the power to issue shares of\npreferred stock at their discretion\u0097with\nvoting rights, conversion, distribution and\nother rights to be determined by the board at\ntime of issue. Blank check preferred stock can\nbe used for sound corporate\npurposes, but could be used as a device to\nthwart hostile takeovers without shareholder\napproval.\n\nGeneral Authorization Requests\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon proposals to increase the\nnumber of authorized shares of preferred stock\nthat are used for general corporate services:\n                                              \n       If share usage (outstanding plus       \n       reserved) is less than 50% of the      \n  \u220e    current authorized shares, vote for    \n       an increase of up                      \n       to 50% of current authorized shares.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       If share usage is 50% to 100% of the   \n       current authorized, vote for an        \n  \u220e    increase of up to 100% of current      \n       authorized                             \n       shares.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       If share usage is greater than         \n  \u220e    current authorized shares, vote for    \n       an increase of up to the current       \n       share usage.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       In the case of a stock split, the      \n       allowable increase is calculated (per  \n  \u220e    above) based on the post-split         \n       adjusted                               \n       authorization.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       If no preferred shares are currently   \n       issued and outstanding, vote against   \n  \u220e    the request, unless the company        \n       discloses a                            \n       specific use for the shares.           \n                                              \nGenerally vote against proposed increases,\neven if within the above ratios, if the\nproposal or the company\u0092s\nprior or ongoing use of authorized shares is\nproblematic, including, but not limited to:\n                                              \n       If the shares requested are blank      \n  \u220e    check preferred shares that can be     \n       used for antitakeover purposes;16      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The company seeks to increase a class  \n       of non-convertible preferred shares    \n  \u220e    entitled to more than one vote per     \n       share on matters that do not solely    \n       affect the rights of preferred         \n       stockholders \u0093supervoting shares\u0094);

These rights guarantee\nexisting shareholders the first\nopportunity to purchase shares of new issues\nof stock in the same class as their own and in\nthe same proportion. The absence of these\nrights could cause stockholders\u0092 interest in a\ncompany to be reduced by the sale of\nadditional shares without\ntheir knowledge and at prices unfavorable to\nthem. Preemptive rights, however, can make it\ndifficult for corporations to issue large\nblocks of stock for general corporate\npurposes. Both corporations and shareholders\nbenefit when corporations are\nable to arrange issues without preemptive\nrights that do not result in a substantial\ntransfer of control.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Review on a case-by-casebasis\nproposals to create or abolish preemptive\nrights.

The burden of proof will\nbe on the company to establish that it has a\nneed for the higher limit.\n\nRenewal of such mandates should be sought\nat each year\u0092s annual meeting.\n\nVote case-by-case on share issuances for a\nspecific transaction or financing proposal.\n                                             \n  6.    Executive and Director Compensation  \n                                             \nThe global financial crisis resulted in\nsignificant erosion of shareholder value and\nhighlighted the need for greater assurance\nthat executive compensation is principally\nperformance-based, fair, reasonable, and not\ndesigned in a manner that would incentivize\nexcessive risk-taking by\nmanagements. The financial crisis raised\nquestions about the role of pay incentives in\ninfluencing executive behavior and motivating\ninappropriate or excessive risk-taking that\ncould threaten a corporation\u0092s long-term\nviability. The safety\nlapses that led to the disastrous explosions\nat BP\u0092s Deepwater Horizon oil rig and Massey\nEnergy\u0092s Upper Big Branch mine, and the\nresulting unprecedented losses in shareholder\nvalue; a) underscore the importance of\nincorporating meaningful\neconomic incentives around social and\nenvironmental considerations in compensation\nprogram design, and b) exemplify the costly\nliabilities of failing to do so.\n\nEvolving disclosure requirements have opened a\nwider window into compensation practices and\nprocesses, giving shareholders more\nopportunity and responsibility to\nensure that pay is designed to create and\nsustain value. Companies in the U.S. are now\nrequired to evaluate and discuss potential\nrisks arising from misguided or misaligned\ncompensation programs. The Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act requires advisory shareholder\nvotes on executive compensation (management\n\u0093say on pay\u0094), an advisory vote on the\nfrequency of say on pay, as well as a\nshareholder advisory vote on golden parachute\ncompensation. The advent of\n\u0093say on pay\u0094 votes for shareholders in the\nU.S. has provided a new communication\nmechanism and impetus for constructive\nengagement between shareholders and\nmanagers/directors on pay issues.\n\nThe socially responsible investing community\ncontends that corporations should be held\naccountable for their actions and decisions,\nincluding those around executive\ncompensation. Catholic Advisory Services\nbelieves that executive pay programs should be\nfair, competitive, reasonable, and create\nappropriate incentives, and that pay for\nperformance should be a central tenet in\nexecutive compensation philosophy.\nMost investors expect corporations to adhere\nto certain best practice pay considerations in\ndesigning and administering executive and\ndirector compensation programs, including:\n                                              \n       Appropriate pay-for-performance        \n       alignment with emphasis on long-term   \n       shareholder value: executive pay       \n       practices must be designed to          \n       attract, retain, and appropriately     \n       motivate the key employees who drive   \n       shareholder value creation over the    \n       long term. Evaluating appropriate      \n  \u220e    alignment of pay incentives with       \n       shareholder value creation includes    \n       taking into consideration, among       \n       other factors, the link between pay    \n       and performance, the mix between       \n       fixed and variable pay, equity-based   \n       plan costs, and performance            \n       goals\u0097including goals tied to social    \n       and environmental considerations.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Avoiding arrangements that risk \u0093pay    \n       for failure\u0094: this includes assessing   \n       the appropriateness of                 \n       long or indefinite contracts,          \n  \u220e    excessive severance packages,          \n       guaranteed compensation, and           \n       practices or policies that fail to     \n       adequately mitigate against or         \n       address environmental, social and      \n       governance failures.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Independent and effective              \n       compensation committees: oversight of  \n       executive pay programs by directors    \n       with                                   \n  \u220e    appropriate skills, knowledge,         \n       experience, and a sound process for    \n       compensation decision-making (e.g.,    \n       including access to independent        \n       expertise and advice when needed)      \n       should be promoted.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    37\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Clear and comprehensive compensation   \n       disclosures: shareholders expect       \n  \u220e    companies to provide informative and   \n       timely disclosures that enable         \n       shareholders to evaluate executive     \n       pay practices fully and fairly.        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Avoiding inappropriate pay to          \n       non-executive directors: compensation  \n       to outside directors should not        \n       compromise their independence and      \n  \u220e    ability to make appropriate            \n       judgments in overseeing managers\u0092 pay   \n       and performance.

This non-binding\nshareholder vote on compensation must be\nincluded in a proxy or consent or\nauthorization at least once every three years.\n\nIn general, the Say on Pay ballot item is the\nprimary focus of voting on executive pay\npractices \u0096 dissatisfaction with compensation\npractices can be expressed\nby voting against the Say on Pay proposal\nrather than voting against or withhold from\nthe compensation committee. However, if there\nis no Say on Pay on the ballot, then the\nnegative vote will apply to members of the\ncompensation committee. In\naddition, in egregious cases, or if the board\nfails to respond to concerns raised by a prior\nSay on Pay proposal, then Catholic Advisory\nServices will recommend vote against or\nwithhold votes from compensation committee\nmembers (or, if the full\nboard is deemed accountable, all directors).\nIf the negative factors involve equity-based\ncompensation, then a vote against an equity-\nbased plan proposal presented for shareholder\napproval may be appropriate. In evaluating Say\non Pay proposals,\nCatholic Advisory Services will also assess to\nwhat degree social and environmental\nconsiderations are incorporated into\ncompensation programs and executive pay\ndecision-making \u0096 to the extent that proxy\nstatement Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis (CD&A) disclosures permit.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Evaluate executive pay and\npractices, as well as certain aspects of\noutside director compensation on a case-by-\ncasebasis.\n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote against management Say on Pay     \n       (\u0093SOP\u0094) proposals if:                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       There is an unmitigated misalignment   \n  \u220e    between CEO pay and company            \n       performance (pay-for-performance);

The SOP is at its essence a\ncommunication vehicle,\nand communication is most useful when it is\nreceived in a consistent and timely manner.\nCatholic Advisory Services supports an annual\nSOP vote for many of the same reasons it\nsupports annual director elections rather than\na classified board\nstructure: because this provides the highest\nlevel of accountability and direct\ncommunication by enabling the SOP vote to\ncorrespond to the majority of the information\npresented in the accompanying proxy statement\nfor the applicable\nshareholders\u0092 meeting. Having SOP votes every\ntwo or three years, covering all actions\noccurring between the votes, would make it\ndifficult to create the meaningful and\ncoherent communication that the votes are\nintended to provide. Under\ntriennial elections, for example, a company\nwould not know whether the shareholder vote\nreferences the compensation year being\ndiscussed or a previous year, making it more\ndifficult to understand the implications of\nthe vote.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor annual advisory votes on compensation,\nwhich provide the most consistent and clear\ncommunication channel for shareholder concerns\nabout companies\u0092 executive pay programs.\n\nAdvisory Vote on Golden Parachutes in an\nAcquisition, Merger, Consolidation, or\nProposed Sale\n\nThis is a proxy item regarding specific\nadvisory votes on \u0093golden parachute\u0094\narrangements for Named Executive Officers\n(NEOs) that is required under The\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act.

However, the\npresence of multiple legacy problematic\nfeatures will also be closely scrutinized.\n\nIn cases where the golden parachute vote is\nincorporated into a company\u0092s\nadvisory vote on compensation (\u0093management\n\u0093say on pay\u0094), Catholic Advisory Services will\nevaluate the \u0093say on pay\u0094 proposal in\naccordance with these guidelines, which may\ngive higher weight to that component of the\noverall\nevaluation.\n\nEquity-Based Incentive Plans\n\nAs executive pay levels continue to soar, non-\nsalary compensation remains one of the most\nsensitive and visible corporate\ngovernance issues. The financial crisis raised\nquestions about the role of pay incentives in\ninfluencing executive behavior, including\ntheir appetite for risk-taking. Although\nshareholders may have little say about how\nmuch the CEO is paid in salary\nand bonus, they do have a major voice in\napproving stock incentive plans.\n\nStock-based plans can transfer significant\namounts of wealth from shareholders to\nexecutives and directors and are among the\nmost economically significant issues that\nshareholders are entitled to vote on. Rightly,\nthe cost of these plans must be in line with\nthe anticipated benefits to shareholders.\nClearly, reasonable limits\nmust be set on dilution as well as\nadministrative authority. In addition,\nshareholders must consider the necessity of\nthe various pay programs and examine the\nappropriateness of award types. Consequently,\nthe pros and cons of these proposals\nnecessitate a case-by-case evaluation.\n\nFactors that increase the cost (or have\nthe potential to increase the cost) of plans\nto shareholders include: excessive dilution,\noptions awarded at below-market discounts,\npermissive policies on pyramiding, restricted\nstock giveaways that reward tenure rather than\nresults, sales of\nshares on concessionary terms, blank-check\nauthority for administering committees, option\nrepricing or option replacements, accelerated\nvesting of awards in the event of defined\nchanges in corporate control, stand-alone\nstock appreciation rights,\nloans or other forms of assistance, or\nevidence of improvident award policies.\n\nPositive plan features that can offset costly\nfeatures include: plans with modest\ndilution potential (i.e. appreciably below\ndouble-digit levels), bars to pyramiding and\nrelated safeguards for investor interests.\nAlso favorable are performance programs with a\nduration of two or more years, bonus schemes\nthat pay off in non-dilutive, fully deductible\ncash, 401K and other thrift or profit sharing\nplans, and tax-favored employee stock purchase\nplans. In general, we believe that stock plans\nshould afford incentives, not sure-fire, risk-\nfree rewards.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon certain equity-based\ncompensation plans20 depending on a\ncombination of certain plan features and\nequity grant practices, where positive factors\nmay counterbalance negative factors, and vice\nversa, as evaluated using an\n\u0093Equity Plan Scorecard\u0094 (EPSC) approach with\nthree pillars:\n                                              \n       Plan Cost: The total estimated cost    \n       of the company\u0092s equity plans relative  \n       to industry/market cap peers,          \n  \u220e    measured by the company\u0092s estimated     \n       Shareholder Value Transfer (SVT) in    \n       relation to peers and considering      \n       both:                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       SVT based on new shares requested      \n       plus shares remaining for future       \n  \u220e    grants, plus outstanding               \n       unvested/unexercised grants;

SVT is\nexpressed as both a dollar amount and as a\npercentage of market value, and includes the\nnew shares proposed, shares available under\nexisting plans, and shares\ngranted but unexercised (using two measures,\nin the case of plans subject to the Equity\nPlan Scorecard evaluation, as noted above).\nAll award types are valued. For omnibus plans,\nunless limitations are placed on the most\nexpensive types of awards\n(for example, full value awards), the\nassumption is made that all awards to be\ngranted will be the most expensive types. See\ndiscussion of specific types of awards.\n\nExcept for proposals subject to Equity Plan\nScorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value\nTransfer is reasonable if it falls below a\ncompany-specific benchmark. The\nbenchmark is determined as follows: The top\nquartile performers in each industry group\n(using the Global Industry Classification\nStandard: GICS) are identified.

Also, consider the terms\nof the surrendered options, such as the grant\ndate, exercise price and vesting schedule.\nGrant dates of surrendered options should be\nfar enough back (two to three\nyears) so as not to suggest that repricings\nare being done to take advantage of short-term\ndownward price movements. Similarly, the\nexercise price of surrendered options should\nbe above the 52-week high for\nthe stock price.\n\nVote for shareholder proposals to put option\nrepricings to a shareholder vote.\n\nStock Plans in Lieu of Cash\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on plans that        \n       provide                                \n  \u220e    participants with the option of        \n       taking all or a portion of their cash  \n       compensation in the form of stock.     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for non-employee director-only    \n  \u220e    equity plans that provide a            \n       dollar-for-dollar cash-for-stock       \n       exchange.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on plans which do    \n       not                                    \n       provide a dollar-for-dollar cash for   \n       stock exchange.

A\n401(k) plan is any qualified plan under\nSection 401(k) of the Internal\nRevenue Code that contains a cash or deferred\narrangement. In its simplest form, an employee\ncan elect to have a portion of his salary\ninvested in a 401(k) plan before any income\ntaxes are assessed. The money can only be\nwithdrawn before retirement\nunder penalty. However, because the money\ncontributed to the plan is withdrawn before\ntaxes (reducing the employee\u0092s income tax), a\nproperly planned 401(k) plan will enable an\nemployee to make larger contributions to a\n401(k) plan than to a\nsavings plan, and still take the same amount\nhome.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor proposals to implement a 401(k) savings\nplan for employees.\n\nSeverance Agreements for Executives/Golden\nParachutes\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\non a case-by-casebasis on proposals to ratify\nor cancel golden parachutes.

Directors themselves oversee\nthe process for evaluating board performance\nand establishing pay\npackages for board members.\n\nShareholders provide limited oversight of\ndirectors by electing individuals who are\nprimarily selected by the board, or a board\nnominating committee, and by voting on stock-\nbased plans for directors designed by the\nboard compensation committee. Additionally,\nshareholders may submit and vote on their own\nresolutions seeking to limit or restructure\ndirector pay. While the cost\nof compensating non-employee directors is\nsmall in absolute terms, compared to the cost\nof compensating executives, it is still a\ncritical aspect of a company\u0092s overall\ncorporate governance structure.\n\nOverall, director pay levels are rising in\npart because of the new forms of pay in use at\nmany companies, as well as because of the\nincreased responsibilities\narising from the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nrequirements. In addition to an annual\nretainer fee, many companies also pay fees for\nattending board and committee meetings, fees\nfor chairing a committee, or a retainer fee\nfor chairing a committee.\n\nDirector compensation packages should be\ndesigned to provide value to directors for\ntheir contribution. Given that many directors\nare high-level executives whose\npersonal income levels are generally high,\ncash compensation may hold little appeal.\nStock-based incentives on the other hand\nreinforce the directors\u0092 role of protecting\nand enhancing shareholder value. The stock-\nbased component of director\ncompensation should be large enough to ensure\nthat when faced with a situation in which the\ninterests of shareholders and management\ndiffer, the board will have a financial\nincentive to think as a shareholder.\nAdditionally, many companies have\ninstituted equity ownership programs for\ndirectors. Catholic Advisory Services\nrecommends that directors receive stock grants\nequal to three times of their annual retainer,\nas it is a reasonable starting point for\ncompanies of all sizes and\nindustries. A vesting schedule for director\ngrants helps directors to meet the stock\nownership guidelines and maintains their long-\nterm interests in the firm.\n\nDirector compensation packages should also be\ndesigned to attract and retain competent\ndirectors who are willing to risk becoming a\ndefendant in a lawsuit and suffer\npotentially adverse publicity if the company\nruns into financial difficulties or is\nmismanaged.\n\nShareholder Ratification of Director Pay\nPrograms\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon management proposals seeking\nratification of non-employeedirector\ncompensation, based on the following factors:\n                                              \n       If the equity plan under which         \n       non-employee director grants are made  \n  \u220e    is on the                              \n       ballot, whether or not it warrants     \n       support;

Companies\nalso disclose their compensation practices and\ndetails of their stock-based compensation\nplans. While this level of disclosure is\nhelpful, it does not always provide a\ncomprehensive picture of the company\u0092s\ncompensation practices. For\nshareholders to make informed decisions on\ncompensation levels, they need to have clear,\nconcise information at their disposal.\nIncreased disclosure will help ensure that\nmanagement: (1) has legitimate reasons for\nsetting specific pay levels;\nand (2) is held accountable for its actions.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals seeking increased\ndisclosure on executive compensation issues\nincluding the preparation of a formal report\non executive compensation practices and\npolicies.\n\nLimit Executive Compensation\n\nProposals\nthat seek to limit executive or director\ncompensation usually focus on the absolute\ndollar figure of the compensation or focus on\nthe ratio of compensation between the\nexecutives and the average worker of a\nspecific company. Proponents argue that\nthe exponential growth of executive salaries\nis not in the best interests of shareholders,\nespecially when that pay is exorbitant when\ncompared to the compensation of other workers.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for proposals to prepare reports  \n       seeking to compare the wages of a      \n  \u220e    company\u0092s lowest paid worker to the     \n       highest                                \n       paid workers.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on proposals that    \n       seek                                   \n  \u220e    to establish a fixed ratio between     \n       the company\u0092s lowest paid workers and   \n       the highest paid workers.              \n                                              \nStock Ownership Requirements\n\nCorporate directors should own some amount of\nstock of the companies on which they serve as\nboard members. Stock ownership is a\nsimple method to align the interests of\ndirectors with company shareholders.\nNevertheless, many highly qualified\nindividuals such as academics and clergy who\ncan offer valuable perspectives in boardrooms\nmay be unable to purchase individual shares\nof stock. In such a circumstance, the\npreferred solution is to look at the board\nnominees individually and take stock ownership\ninto consideration when voting on the merits\nof each candidate.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote against\nshareholder proposals that mandate a minimum\namount of stock that directors must own in\norder to qualify as a director or to remain on\nthe board.\n\nProhibit/Require Shareholder Approval for\nOption Repricing\n\nRepricing involves the reduction of the\noriginal exercise price of a\nstock option after the fall in share price.\nCatholic Advisory Services does not support\nrepricing since it undermines the incentive\npurpose of the plan. The use of options as an\nincentive means that employees must bear the\nsame risks as shareholders\nin holding these options. Shareholder\nresolutions calling on companies to abandon\nthe practice of repricing or to submit\nrepricings to a shareholder vote will be\nsupported.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking to limit repricing.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n  \u220e    the company to have option repricings  \n       submitted for shareholder              \n       ratification.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    52\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nSeverance Agreements/Golden Parachutes\n\nGolden parachutes are designed to protect the\nemployees of a corporation in the event of a\nchange in control.

Because\nemployer contributions to these plans are\ncredited evenly over the life of a plan, and\nnot based on a seniority formula they may\nreduce payouts to long-term employees who are\ncurrently vested in plans.\n\nCash-balance pension conversions have\nundergone congressional and federal agency\nscrutiny following high-profile EEOC\ncomplaints on age discrimination and\nemployee anger at companies like IBM. While\nsignificant change is unlikely in the short-\ntm, business interests were concerned enough\nthat the National Association of Manufacturers\nand other business lobbies\nformed a Capitol Hill coalition to preserve\nthe essential features of the plans and to\noverturn a IRS ruling. Driving the push behind\nconversions from traditional pension plans to\ncash-balance plans are the substantial savings\nthat companies\ngenerate in the process.

Mergers and Corporate Restructurings  \n                                              \nA merger occurs when one corporation is\nabsorbed into another and ceases to exist. The\nsurviving company gains all the rights,\nprivileges, powers, duties, obligations and\nliabilities of the merged corporation. The\nshareholders of the absorbed company receive\nstock or securities of the\nsurviving company or other consideration as\nprovided by the plan of merger. Mergers,\nconsolidations, share exchanges, and sale of\nassets are friendly in nature, which is to say\nthat both sides have agreed to the combination\nor acquisition of assets.\n\nShareholder approval for an acquiring company\nis generally not required under state law or\nstock exchange regulations unless the\nacquisition is in the form of a\nstock transaction which would result in the\nissue of 20 percent or more of the acquirer\u0092s\noutstanding shares or voting power, or unless\nthe two entities involved require that\nshareholders approve the deal. Under most\nstate laws, however, a\ntarget company must submit merger agreements\nto a shareholder vote. Shareholder approval is\nrequired in the formation of a consolidated\ncorporation.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nM&A analyses are inherently a balance of\ncompeting factors. Bright line rules are\ndifficult if not\nimpossible to apply to a world where every\ndeal is different. Ultimately, the question\nfor shareholders (both of the acquirer and the\ntarget) is the following: Is the valuation\nfair? Shareholders of the acquirer may be\nconcerned that the deal values\nthe target too highly. Shareholders of the\ntarget may be concerned that the deal\nundervalues their interests.\n\nVote recommendation will be based on primarily\nan\nanalysis of shareholder value, which itself\ncan be affected by ancillary factors such as\nthe negotiation process. The importance of\nother factors, including corporate governance\nand social and environmental considerations\nhowever, should not fail to\nbe recognized.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Votes on mergers and\nacquisitions are considered on a case-by-\ncasebasis. A review and evaluation of the\nmerits and drawbacks of the proposed\ntransaction is conducted, balancing various\nand sometimes countervailing factors\nincluding:\n                                              \n       Valuation: Is the value to be          \n       received by the target shareholders    \n       (or paid by the acquirer) reasonable?  \n       While the fairness opinion may         \n  \u220e    provide an initial starting point for  \n       assessing valuation reasonableness,    \n       emphasis is placed on the offer        \n       premium, market reaction and           \n       strategic rationale;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Market reaction: How has the market    \n  \u220e    responded to the proposed deal? A      \n       negative market reaction should        \n       cause closer scrutiny of a deal;       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Strategic rationale: Does the deal     \n       make sense strategically? From where   \n       is the value derived? Cost             \n       and revenue synergies should not be    \n  \u220e    overly aggressive or optimistic, but   \n       reasonably achievable.

In order to be able to\nintelligently monitor their investments,\nshareholders often need information best\nprovided by the company in which they have\ninvested. Requests to report such information\nwill merit support. Requests to establish\nspecial committees of the board to address\nbroad corporate policy and provide forums for\nongoing dialogue on issues including, but not\nlimited to shareholder relations, the\nenvironment, human rights, occupational health\nand safety, and executive\ncompensation, will generally be supported,\nparticularly when they appear to offer a\npotentially effective method for enhancing\nshareholder value. We will closely evaluate\nproposals that ask the company to cease\ncertain actions that the proponent\nbelieves are harmful to society or some\nsegment of society with special attention to\nthe company\u0092s legal and ethical obligations,\nits ability to remain profitable, and\npotential negative publicity if the company\nfails to honor the request.\nCatholic Advisory Services supports\nshareholder proposals that improve the\ncompany\u0092s public image, and reduce exposure to\nliabilities.\n\nDiversity and Equality\n\nSignificant progress has\nbeen made in recent years in the advancement\nof gender and racial diversity in the\nworkplace and the establishment of greater\nprotections against discriminatory practices\nin the workplace. In the U.S, there are many\ncivil rights laws that are\nenforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission. The Civil Rights Act of 1964\nprohibits discrimination based on race,\nreligion, sex, gender identity, sexual\norientation, and nationality. However,\ndiscrimination on the basis of federally\nprotected characteristics continues. The SEC\u0092s\nrevised disclosure rules now require\ninformation on how boards factor diversity\ninto the director nomination process, as well\nas disclosure on how the board assesses the\neffectiveness of its\ndiversity policy. Shareholder proposals on\ndiversity may target a company\u0092s board\nnomination procedures or seek greater\ndisclosure on a company\u0092s programs and\nprocedures on increasing the diversity of its\nworkforce, and make reference to\none or more of the following points:\n                                              \n       Violations of workplace                \n       anti-discrimination laws lead to       \n  \u220e    expensive litigation and damaged       \n       corporate reputations that are         \n       not in the best interests of           \n       shareholders;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Employers already prepare employee     \n       diversity reports for the EEOC, so     \n  \u220e    preparing a similar report to          \n       shareholders can be                    \n       done at minimal cost;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The presence of gender and ethnic      \n       diversity in workforce and customer    \n       pools gives companies with             \n  \u220e    diversified boards a                   \n       practical advantage over their         \n       competitors as a result of their       \n       unique perspectives;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Efforts to increase diversity on       \n  \u220e    corporate boards can be made at        \n       reasonable costs; and                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Reports can be prepared \u0093at reasonable  \n       expense\u0094 describing efforts to          \n  \u220e    encourage diversified representation   \n       on                                     \n       their boards.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    62\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nAdd Women and Minorities to the Board\n\nBoard diversification proposals ask companies\nto put systems in place to increase the\nrepresentation of gender, ethnic, and racial\ndiversity as\nwell as union members or other\nunderrepresented minority groups on boards of\ndirectors.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that    \n  \u220e    ask the company to take steps to       \n       increase diversity to the board.       \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n       for reports on board diversity.        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n       companies to adopt nomination          \n  \u220e    charters or amend existing charters    \n       to include                             \n       reasonable language addressing         \n       diversity.                             \n                                              \nRacial Equity and/or Civil Rights Audits\n\nCatholic Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote for proposals\nrequesting that a company conduct an\nindependent racial equity and/or civil rights\naudit, considering company disclosures,\npolicies, actions, and engagements.\n\nReport on the Distribution of Stock Options by\nGender and Race\n\nCompanies have received requests from\nshareholders to prepare reports documenting\nthe distribution of the stock options and\nrestricted stock awards by race and gender\nof the recipient. Proponents of these\nproposals argue that, in the future, there\nwill be a shift toward basing racial and\ngender discrimination suits on the\ndistribution of corporate wealth through stock\noptions. The appearance of these proposals is\nalso in response to the nationwide wage gap\nand under representation of minorities and\nwomen at the highest levels of compensation.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals asking companies to\nreport on the distribution of stock options by\nrace and gender of the recipient.\n\nPrepare Report/Promote EEOC-Related Activities\n\nFilers of proposals on this issue generally\nask a company to make available, at reasonable\ncost and omitting proprietary information,\ndata the company includes in its\nannual report to the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) outlining the\nmake-up of its workforce by race, gender and\nposition. Shareholders also ask companies to\nreport on any efforts they are making\nto advance the representation of\nunderrepresented gender, ethnic, and racial\nidentities in their workforce. The costs of\nviolating federal laws that prohibit\ndiscrimination by corporations are high and\ncan affect corporate earnings. The Equal\nOpportunities Employment Commission does not\nrelease the companies\u0092 filings to the public,\nunless it is involved in litigation, and this\ninformation is difficult to obtain from other\nsources. Companies need to be sensitive to\ndiverse workforce\nemployment issues as new generations of\nworkers become increasingly diverse.

Shareholder proponents and other\nactivist groups concerned with LGBTQ rights,\nsuch as the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and\nthe Pride Foundation, have targeted U.S.\ncompanies that do not specifically restrict\ndiscrimination on the basis of\nsexual orientation in their EEO statements.\nShareholder proposals on this topic ask\ncompanies to change the language of their EEO\nstatements in order to put in place anti-\ndiscrimination protection for their LGBTQ\nemployees. In addition, proposals\nmay seek disclosure on a company\u0092s general\ninitiatives to create a workplace free of\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation, including reference to such items\nas support of LGBTQ employee groups, diversity\ntraining that addresses\nsexual orientation, and non-medical benefits\nto domestic partners of LGBTQ employees.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals to      \n       include language in EEO statements     \n  \u220e    specifically barring discrimination    \n       on the                                 \n       basis of sexual orientation or gender  \n       identity.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking reports on a company\u0092s          \n  \u220e    initiatives to create a workplace      \n       free of                                \n       discrimination on the basis of sexual  \n       orientation or gender identity.        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against shareholder proposals     \n  \u220e    that seek to eliminate protection      \n       already afforded to LGBTQ employees.   \n                                              \nReport on/Eliminate Use of Racial Stereotypes\nin Advertising\n\nMany companies continue to use racial\nstereotypes or images perceived as racially\ninsensitive in their advertising campaigns.\nFilers of shareholder proposals on this\ntopic often request companies to give more\ncareful consideration to the symbols and\nimages that are used to promote the company.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals seeking more careful\nconsideration of using racial stereotypes in\nadvertising campaigns, including preparation\nof a report on this issue.\n\nGender, Race, or Ethnicity Pay Gap\n\nOver the past several years, shareholders have\nfiled resolutions requesting that companies\nreport whether a gender, race, or ethnicity\npay gap exists, and if\nso, what measures are being taken to eliminate\nthe gap.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    64\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor requests for reports on a company\u0092s pay\ndata by gender, race, or ethnicity, or a\nreport on a company\u0092s policies and goals to\nreduce any gender, race, or ethinicity pay\ngap.\n\nLabor and Human Rights\n\nInvestors, international human rights groups,\nand labor advocacy groups have long been\nmaking attempts to safeguard worker rights in\nthe international marketplace. In\ninstances where companies themselves operate\nfactories in developing countries for example,\nthese advocates have asked that the companies\nadopt global corporate standards that\nguarantee sustainable wages and safe working\nconditions for their workers\nabroad. Companies that contract out portions\nof their manufacturing operations to foreign\ncompanies have been asked to ensure that the\nproducts they receive from those contractors\nhave not been made using forced labor, child\nlabor, or other forms of\nmodern slavery. These companies are asked to\nadopt formal vendor standards that, among\nother things, include some sort of monitoring\nmechanism. Globalization, relocation of\nproduction overseas, and widespread use of\nsubcontractors and vendors, often\nmake it difficult to obtain a complete picture\nof a company\u0092s labor practices in global\nmarkets. Deadly accidents at factories,\nnotably in Bangladesh and Pakistan, have\ncontinued to intensify these concerns. Many\ninvestors believe that\ncompanies would benefit from adopting a human\nrights policy based on the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the\nInternational Labour Organization\u0092s Core Labor\nStandards. Efforts that seek greater\ndisclosure on a company\u0092s global\nlabor practices, including its supply chain,\nand that seek to establish minimum standards\nfor a company\u0092s operations will be supported.\nIn addition, requests for independent\nmonitoring of overseas operations will be\nsupported.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services generally supports\nproposals that call for the adoption and/or\nenforcement of principles or codes relating to\ncountries in which there are\nsystematic violations of human rights; such as\nthe use of slave, child, or prison labor; a\ngovernment that is illegitimate; or there is a\ncall by human rights advocates, pro-democracy\norganizations, or\nlegitimately-elected representatives for\neconomic sanctions. The use of child labor, or\nforced labor is unethical and can damage\ncorporate reputations. Poor labor practices\ncan lead to litigation against the company,\nwhich can be costly and time\nconsuming.\n\nCodes of Conduct and Vendor Standards\n\nShareholders have submitted proposals that\npertain to the adoption of codes of conduct or\nprovision, greater disclosure on a company\u0092s\ninternational workplace\nstandards, or that request human rights risk\nassessment. Companies have been asked to adopt\na number of different types of codes,\nincluding a workplace code of conduct,\nstandards for international business\noperations, human rights standards,\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO)\nstandards and the SA 8000 principles. The ILO\nis an independent agency of the United Nations\nwhich consists of 187 member nations\nrepresented by workers, employers, and\ngovernments. The ILO\u0092s general\nmandate is to promote a decent workplace for\nall individuals. The ILO sets international\nlabor standards in the form of its conventions\nand then monitors compliance with the\nstandards. The seven conventions of the ILO\nfall under four broad\ncategories: Right to organize and bargain\ncollectively, Nondiscrimination in employment,\nAbolition of forced labor, and End of child\nlabor. Each of the 187 member-nations of the\nILO is bound to respect and promote these\nrights to the best of their\nabilities. SA 8000 is a set of labor\nstandards, based on the principles of the ILO\nconventions and other human rights\nconventions, and covers eight workplace\nconditions, including: child labor, forced\nlabor, health and safety, freedom of\nassociation\nand the right to collective bargaining,\ndiscrimination, disciplinary practices,\nworking hours and compensation. Companies have\nalso turned to the United Nations \u0093Guiding\nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights,\u0094 a\nset of guidelines that\ncreate a framework for states to protect human\nrights, corporations to respect human rights,\nand rights-holders to access remediation.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals to      \n  \u220e    implement human rights standards and   \n       workplace codes of conduct.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       calling for the implementation and     \n  \u220e    reporting on ILO codes of conduct, SA  \n       8000 Standards,                        \n       or human rights due diligence          \n       practices.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that    \n       call for the adoption of principles    \n  \u220e    or codes of conduct relating to        \n       company                                \n       investments in countries with          \n       patterns of human rights abuses.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that    \n       call for independent monitoring        \n       programs in conjunction with local     \n  \u220e    and respected                          \n       religious and human rights groups to   \n       monitor supplier and licensee          \n       compliance with codes.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    65\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that    \n       seek publication of a \u0093Code of Conduct\u0094  \n       by the company\u0092s                        \n       foreign suppliers and licensees,       \n  \u220e    requiring that they satisfy all        \n       applicable standards and laws          \n       protecting employees\u0092 wages, benefits,  \n       working conditions, freedom of         \n       association, and other rights.         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for proposals requesting that a   \n       company conduct an assessment of the   \n  \u220e    human rights risks in its operations   \n       or in its                              \n       supply chain, or report on its human   \n       rights risk assessment process.        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking reports on, or the adoption    \n       of, vendor standards including:        \n       reporting on                           \n  \u220e    incentives to encourage suppliers to   \n       raise standards rather than terminate  \n       contracts and providing public         \n       disclosure of contract supplier        \n       reviews on a regular basis.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals to      \n       adopt labor standards for foreign and  \n       domestic suppliers to ensure that      \n       the company will not do business with  \n  \u220e    foreign suppliers that manufacture     \n       products for sale in the U.S. using    \n       forced labor, child labor, or that     \n       fail to comply with applicable laws    \n       protecting employee\u0092s wages and         \n       working conditions.                    \n                                              \nAdopt/Report on MacBride Principles\n\nThese resolutions have called for the adoption\nof the MacBride Principles for operations\nlocated in Northern Ireland. They request\ncompanies operating abroad to\nsupport the equal employment opportunity\npolicies that apply in facilities they operate\ndomestically. The principles were established\nto address the sectarian hiring problems\nbetween Protestants and Catholics in Northern\nIreland. It is well\ndocumented that Northern Ireland\u0092s Catholic\ncommunity faced much higher unemployment\nfigures than the Protestant community. In\nresponse to this problem, the U.K. government\ninstituted the New Fair Employment Act of 1989\n(and subsequent\namendments) to address the sectarian hiring\nproblems.\n\nMany companies believe that the Act adequately\naddresses the problems and that further\naction, including\nadoption of the MacBride Principles, only\nduplicates the efforts already underway. In\nevaluating a proposal to adopt the MacBride\nPrinciples, shareholders must decide whether\nthe principles will cause companies to divest,\nand therefore worsen the\nunemployment problem, or whether the\nprinciples will promote equal hiring\npractices. Proponents believe that the Fair\nEmployment Act does not sufficiently address\nthe sectarian hiring problems. They argue that\nthe MacBride Principles serve to\nstabilize the situation and promote further\ninvestment.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals to report on or\nimplement the MacBride Principles.\n\nCommunity Impact Assessment/Indigenous\nPeoples\u0092 Rights\n\nA number of U.S. public companies have found\ntheir operations or\nexpansion plans in conflict with local\nindigenous groups. In order to improve their\nstanding with indigenous groups and decrease\nany negative publicity companies may face,\nsome concerned shareholders have sought\nreports requesting that companies\nreview their obligations, actions and presence\non these groups. Some companies have made\nprogress in working with indigenous groups.\nHowever, shareholders who are concerned with\nthe negative impact that the company\u0092s\noperations may have on the\nindigenous people\u0092s land and community, have\nsought reports detailing the impact of the\ncompany\u0092s actions and presence on these\ngroups.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals asking to prepare\nreports on a company\u0092s environmental and\nhealth impact on communities.\n\nReport on Risks of Outsourcing\n\nConsumer interest in keeping costs low through\ncomparison shopping, coupled with\nbreakthroughs in productivity have prompted\ncompanies to look for methods of\nincreasing profit margins while keeping prices\ncompetitive. Through a practice known as off-\nshoring, the outsourcing or moving of\nmanufacturing and service operations to\nforeign markets with lower labor costs,\ncompanies have found one method where the\nperceived savings potential is quite\nsubstantial. Shareholder opponents of\noutsourcing argue that there may be long-term\nconsequences to offshore outsourcing that\noutweigh short-term benefits such as\nbacklash from a public already sensitive to\noff-shoring, security risks from\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    66\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \ninformation technology development overseas,\nand diminished\nemployee morale.

With limited\naccess to adequate treatments, the increasing\ndeath toll is expected to have profound\nsocial, political, and economic impact\nglobally, including on the companies or\nindustries with operations in affected\nareas. In the past, shareholder proposals\nasked companies to develop policies to provide\naffordable drugs in historically disadvantaged\nregions. However, in recent years,\nshareholders have changed their tactic, asking\ninstead for reports on the\nimpact of these pandemics on company\noperations, including both pharmaceutical and\nnon-pharmaceutical companies operating in\nhigh-risk areas. This change is consistent\nwith the general shift in shareholder\nproposals towards risk assessment and\nmitigation.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals asking for companies\nto report on the impact of pandemics, such as\nCOVID-19,HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis,\non their business strategies.\n\nMandatory Arbitration\n\nCatholic Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote for requests for\na report on a company\u0092s use of mandatory\narbitration on employment-related claims.\n\nSexual Harassment\n\nCatholic Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote for requests for\na report on company actions taken to\nstrengthen policies and oversight to prevent\nworkplace sexual harassment, or a report on\nrisks posed by a company\u0092s failure to prevent\nworkplace sexual harassment.\n                                              \n   Operations in High-Risk Markets            \n                                              \nIn recent\nyears, shareholder advocates and human rights\norganizations have highlighted concerns\nassociated with companies operating in regions\nthat are politically unstable, including state\nsponsors of terror. The U.S. government has\nactive trade sanction\nregimes in place against specific companies,\nor persons, including Russia, China, Cuba,\nIran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, among\nothers. These sanctions are enforced by the\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control, which is\npart of the U.S. Department of\nthe Treasury, as well as U.S. Customs and\nBorder Patrol for sanctioned goods. However,\nthese countries do not comprise an exhaustive\nlist of countries considered to be high-risk\nmarkets.\n\nShareholder proponents have filed resolutions\naddressing a variety of concerns around how\ninvestments and operations in high-risk\nregions may support, or be perceived\nto support, potentially oppressive\ngovernments. Proponents contend that\noperations in these countries may lead to\npotential reputational, regulatory, and/or\nsupply chain risks as a result of operational\ndisruptions. Concerned shareholders have\nrequested investment withdrawals or cessation\nof operations in high-risk markets as well as\nreports on operations in high-risk markets.\nSuch reports may seek additional disclosure\nfrom companies on criteria employed for\ninvesting in, continuing to\noperate in, and withdrawing from specific\ncountries.\n\nDepending on the country\u0092s human rights\nrecord, investors have also asked companies to\nrefrain from\ncommencing new projects in the country of\nconcern until improvements are made. In\naddition, investors have sought greater\ndisclosure on the nature of a company\u0092s\ninvolvement in the country and on the impact\nof their involvement or operations.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    67\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor requests for a review of and a report\noutlining the company\u0092s potential financial\nand reputation risks associated with\noperations in \u0093high-risk\u0094 markets, such as a\nterrorism-sponsoring state or otherwise,\ntaking into account:\n                                              \n       The nature, purpose, and scope of the  \n       operations and business involved that  \n  \u220e    could be affected by social or         \n       political                              \n       disruption;                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Current disclosure of applicable risk  \n  \u220e    assessment(s) and risk management      \n       procedures;                            \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Compliance with U.S. sanctions and     \n       laws;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Consideration of other international   \n       policies, standards, and laws;         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether the company has been recently  \n  \u220e    involved in significant controversies  \n       or violations in \u0093high-risk\u0094             \n       markets.                               \n                                              \nReports on Operations in Burma/Myanmar\n\nSince the early 1960s, Burma (also known as\nMyanmar) has been ruled by a military\ndictatorship that has been condemned for human\nrights abuses, including slave labor,\ntorture, rape and murder. Many companies have\npulled out of Burma over the past decade given\nthe controversy surrounding involvement in the\ncountry.

In addition, a\nnumber of Chinese companies have been\nconnected to the use of state-sponsored forced\nlabor of Uyghur and other Muslim minority\ngroups.

Resolution sponsors\ngenerally argue that the Chinese government is\nusing IT company technologies to track,\nmonitor, identify, and,\nultimately, suppress political dissent. In the\nview of proponents, this process of\nsurveillance and associated suppression\nviolates internationally accepted norms\noutlined in the U.N. Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights.\n\nWhile early shareholder resolutions on\nInternet issues focused on censorship by\nrepressive regimes and net neutrality,\nproponents have recently raised concerns\nregarding privacy and data security in the\nwake of increased breaches that result in the\nmisuse of personal information. On Oct. 13,\n2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) issued a guidance document about the\ndisclosure obligations\nrelating to cybersecurity risks and cyber\nincidents. In the document, the SEC references\nthe negative consequences that are associated\nwith cyber-attacks, such as: remediation\ncosts, including those required to repair\nrelationships with customers\nand clients; increased cyber-security\nprotection costs; lost revenues from\nunauthorized use of the information or missed\nopportunities to attract clients; litigation;\nand reputational damage. The document says\nthat while the federal securities laws\ndo not explicitly require disclosure of\ncybersecurity risks and incidents, some\ndisclosure requirements may impose an\nobligation on the company to disclose such\ninformation and provides scenarios where\ndisclosure may be required. According to the\nFBI\u0092s 2021 Internet Crime report, potential\nlosses from cybercrimes hit $6.9 billion, up\n64% from 2018.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor resolutions requesting the disclosure and\nimplementation of Internet privacy and\ncensorship policies and procedures\nconsidering:\n                                              \n       The level of disclosure of policies    \n       and procedures relating to privacy,    \n  \u220e    freedom of speech, Internet            \n       censorship, and                        \n       government monitoring of the           \n       Internet;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Engagement in dialogue with            \n       governments and/or relevant groups     \n  \u220e    with respect to the Internet and the   \n       free flow of                           \n       information;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       The scope of business involvement and  \n       of investment in markets that          \n  \u220e    maintain government censorship or      \n       monitoring of the                      \n       Internet;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       The market-specific laws or            \n       regulations applicable to Internet     \n  \u220e    censorship or monitoring that may be   \n       imposed on the                         \n       company; and                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       The level of controversy or            \n  \u220e    litigation related to the company\u0092s     \n       international human rights policies    \n       and procedures.                        \n                                              \nDisclosure on Plant Closings\n\nShareholders have asked that companies\ncontemplating plant closures consider the\nimpact of such closings on employees and the\ncommunity, especially when such plan\nclosures involve a community\u0092s largest\nemployers.

Scientists generally agree that gases\nreleased by chemical reactions\nincluding the burning of fossil fuels\ncontribute to a \u0093greenhouse effect\u0094 that traps\nthe planet\u0092s heat. Environmentalists claim\nthat the Greenhouse Gases(GHG) produced by the\nindustrial age have caused recent weather\ncrises such as\nheat waves, rainstorms, melting glaciers,\nrising sea levels and receding coastlines.\nClimate change skeptics have described the\nrise and fall of global temperatures as\nnaturally occurring phenomena and depicted\nhuman impact on climate change as\nminimal. Shareholder proposals requesting\ncompanies to issue a report to shareholders,\n\u0093at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary\ninformation,\u0094 on greenhouse gas emissions ask\nthat the report include descriptions of\ncorporate efforts to\nreduce emissions, companies\u0092 financial\nexposure and potential liability from\noperations that contribute to global warming,\ntheir direct or indirect efforts to promote\nthe view that global warming is not a threat,\nand their goals in reducing\nthese emissions from their operations.\nShareholder proponents argue that there is\nscientific proof that the burning of fossil\nfuels causes global warming, that future\nlegislation may make companies financially\nliable for their contributions to\nglobal warming, and that a report on the\ncompany\u0092s role in global warming can be\nassembled at reasonable cost.\n\n22 Variations of this request also include\nclimate transition\nrelated ambitions, or commitment to reporting\non the implementation of a climate plan.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    70\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking information on the financial,  \n       physical, or regulatory risks it       \n  \u220e    faces related to                       \n       climate change- on its operations and  \n       investments, or on how the company     \n       identifies, measures, and manage such  \n       risks.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n  \u220e    calling for the reduction of GHG or    \n       adoption of GHG goals in products and  \n       operations.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking reports on responses to        \n       regulatory and public pressures        \n  \u220e    surrounding climate                    \n       change, and for disclosure of          \n       research that aided in setting         \n       company policies around climate        \n       change.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       requesting reports on greenhouse gas   \n  \u220e    emissions from companies\u0092 operations    \n       and/or                                 \n       products.                              \n                                              \nInvest in Clean/Renewable Energy\n\nFilers of proposals on renewable energy ask\ncompanies to increase their investment in\nrenewable energy sources and to work to\ndevelop products that rely more on\nrenewable energy sources. Increased use of\nrenewable energy will reduce the negative\nenvironmental impact of energy companies. In\naddition, as supplies of oil and coal exist in\nthe earth in limited quantities, renewable\nenergy sources represent a\ncompetitive, and some would argue essential,\nlong-term business strategy.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking the preparation of a report    \n  \u220e    on a company\u0092s activities related to    \n       the                                    \n       development of renewable energy        \n       sources.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking increased investment in        \n  \u220e    renewable energy sources unless the    \n       terms of the                           \n       resolution are overly restrictive.     \n                                              \nEnergy Efficiency\n\nReducing the negative impact to the\nenvironment can be done through the use of\nmore energy efficient practices and products.\nShareholders propose that corporations\nshould have energy efficient manufacturing\nprocesses and should market more energy\nefficient products.

In addition,\nsome proponents cite the negative financial\nimplications for companies with poor\nenvironmental practices, including liabilities\nassociated with site clean-ups and lawsuits,\nas well as arguments that energy efficient\nproducts and clean environmental practices are\nsustainable business practices that will\ncontribute to long-term shareholder value.\nShareholders\nproponents point out that the majority of\nindependent atmospheric scientists agree that\nglobal warming poses a serious problem to the\nhealth and welfare of our planet, citing the\nfindings of the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change. Shareholder\nactivists argue that companies can report on\ntheir greenhouse gas emissions within a few\nmonths at reasonable cost. The general trend\nindicates a movement towards encouraging\ncompanies to have proactive environmental\npolicies, focusing on maximizing\nthe efficient use of non-renewable resources\nand minimizing threats of harm to human health\nor the environment.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    71\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nEnvironmental/Sustainability Reports\n\nShareholders may request general environmental\ndisclosures or reports on a specific\nlocation/operation, often requesting that the\ncompany detail the\nenvironmental risks and potential liabilities\nof a specific project. Increasingly, companies\nhave begun reporting on environmental and\nsustainability issues using the Global\nReporting Initiative (GRI) standards. The GRI\nwas established in 1997 with\nthe mission of developing globally applicable\nguidelines for reporting on economic,\nenvironmental, and social performance. The GRI\nwas developed by Ceres (formerly known as the\nCoalition for Environmentally Responsible\nEconomies) in partnership with\nthe United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP).\n\nCeres was formed in the wake of the March 1989\nExxon Valdez oil spill, when a consortium of\ninvestors,\nenvironmental groups, and religious\norganizations drafted what were originally\nnamed the Valdez Principles. Later named the\nCeres Principles, and now branded the Ceres\nRoadmap 2030, corporate signatories of the\nCeres Roadmap 2030 pledge to\ninstitute accountability mechanisms that\nintegrate sustainability considerations into\ncore business systems and decision-making on\ntopics such as governance, stakeholder\nengagement and disclosure. Signatories also\npledge to build systems across a\ncorporation\u0092s value chain to enable ongoing\nimprovements in three priority environmental\nand social impact areas (Climate Change,\nNatural Resources, and Human Rights).\n\nThe Equator Principles are the financial\nindustry\u0092s benchmark for determining,\nassessing and managing social and\nenvironmental risk in project financing. First\nlaunched in June 2003, the Principles were\nultimately adopted by over forty financial\ninstitutions over a three-year implementation\nperiod. Since its adoption, the Principles\nhave undergone a number of revisions,\nexpanding the use of performance\nstandards and signatory banks\u0092 banks\u0092\ncommitments to social responsibility,\nincluding human rights, climate change, and\ntransparency. The fourth iteration of the\nPrinciples was launched in November 2019,\nincorporating amendments and new\ncommitment to human rights, climate change,\nIndigenous Peoples and biodiversity related\ntopics.

The high\nviscosity of bitumen makes its extraction a\nchallenging and resource-intensive process;\nthe most common extraction technique involves\npumping steam into the oil\nsands to lower the viscosity of bitumen in\norder to pump it to the surface.\n\nOne of the most prominent issues concerning\noil sands is the large volume of\ngreenhouse gases (GHG) associated with\nproduction. Oil sands are by far one of the\nmost energy-intensive forms of oil production,\nreleasing three times more GHG emissions from\nproduction than conventional oil.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    72\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nShareholders have kept up pressure on the\nissue of potential\nlong-term risks to companies posed by the\nenvironmental, social, and economic challenges\nassociated with Canadian oil sands operations.\nResolutions on the topic have focused on\nrequesting greater transparency on the\nramifications of oil sands\ndevelopment projects.\n\nArctic National Wildlife Refuge\n\nThe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is\na federally protected wilderness along\nAlaska\u0092s North Slope. In the past, legislation\nproposed in both the House\nand Senate that, if passed, would allow a\nportion of this area to be leased to private\ncompanies for development and production of\noil, has been witnessed. Oil companies have\nexpressed an interest in bidding for these\nleases given the opportunity.\nIn response, shareholder activists have filed\nresolutions asking these companies to cancel\nany plans to drill in the ANWR and cease their\nlobbying efforts to open the area for\ndrilling. Proponents of shareholder proposals\non this issue argue that\nthe Coastal Plain section of the ANWR is the\nmost environmentally sensitive area of the\nrefuge, that the majority of Alaska\u0092s North\nSlope that is not federally designated\nwilderness already provides the oil industry\nwith sufficient resources\nfor oil production, and that advocates of\ndrilling in ANWR overstate the benefit to be\nderived from opening the wilderness to oil\nproduction. Those in favor of opening the area\nup to drilling note that only a small portion\nof ANWR would be\nconsidered for exploration, and if drilling\nwere to take place, it would be on less than\none percent of the entire area, that modern\ntechnology reduces the environmental impact of\noil drilling on both the land and surrounding\nwildlife, and that oil\nproduction in ANWR would have considerable\nbenefit to company shareholders, Alaskans, and\nthe United States as a whole.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for requests for reports on       \n       potential environmental damage as a    \n  \u220e    result of company operations in        \n       protected                              \n       regions.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n       companies to prepare reports or adopt  \n  \u220e    policies on operations that include    \n       mining,                                \n       drilling or logging in                 \n       environmentally sensitive areas.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking to curb or reduce the sale of  \n  \u220e    products manufactured from materials   \n       extracted from                         \n       environmentally sensitive areas such   \n       as old growth forests.                 \n                                              \nHydraulic Fracturing\n\nShareholder proponents have elevated concerns\non the use of hydraulic fracturing, an\nincreasingly controversial process in which\nwater, sand, and a mix of chemicals\nare blasted horizontally into tight layers of\nshale rock to extract natural gas.

Proponents\nof resolutions at companies that employ\nhydraulic fracturing are also concerned that\nwastewater produced by the process could\noverload the waste treatment plants to which\nit is shipped. Shareholders have\nasked companies that utilize hydraulic\nfracturing to report on the environmental\nimpact of the practice and to disclose\npolicies aimed at reducing hazards from the\nprocess.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nforrequests seeking greater transparency on\nthe practice of hydraulic fracturing and its\nassociated risks.\n\nPhase Out Chlorine-Based Chemicals\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nidentified chlorine bleaching of pulp and\npaper as a major source of dioxin, a known\nhuman carcinogen linked\nto have negative effects to humans and\nanimals.

Another resolution\ncalls for companies to report on\n\u0093offsets\u0094 e.g. guarantee of new jobs in the\npurchasing country and technology transfers.\nOffsets involve a commitment by military\ncontractors and the U.S. government to direct\nbenefits back to a foreign government as a\ncondition of a\nmilitary sale.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals to      \n  \u220e    report on foreign military sales or    \n       offset agreements.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on                   \n  \u220e    proposals that call for outright       \n       restrictions on foreign military       \n       sales.                                 \n                                              \nDepleted Uranium/Nuclear Weapons\n\nDepleted uranium is the less radioactive\nuranium that is left behind after enriched\nuranium is produced for nuclear reactor fuel\nand fissile material\nfor nuclear weapons. The main difference is\nthat depleted uranium contains at least three\ntimes less U-235 than natural uranium.\nHowever, it is still weakly radioactive.\nShareholders want reports on\ncompanies\u0092 policies, procedures and\ninvolvement in the said substance and nuclear\nweapons.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nforshareholder proposals requesting a report\non involvement, policies, and procedures\nrelated to depleted uranium and nuclear\nweapons.\n\nAdopt Ethical Criteria for Weapons Contracts\n\nShareholders have requested that companies\nreview their code of conduct and statements of\nethical criteria for military production-\nrelated contract bids, awards, and\nexecution to incorporate environmental factors\nand sustainability issues related to the\ncontract bidding process. Sustainability is a\nbusiness model that requires companies to\nbalance the needs and interests of various\nstakeholders while\nconcurrently sustaining their businesses,\ncommunities, and the environment for future\ngenerations.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals asking companies to\nreview and amend, if necessary, the company\u0092s\ncode of conduct and statements of ethical\ncriteria for military production-related\ncontract bids, awards and execution.\n\nAnimal Welfare\n\nAnimal Rights/Testing\n\nShareholders and\nanimal rights groups, including People for the\nEthical Treatment of Animals (PETA), may file\nresolutions calling for the end to painful and\nunnecessary animal testing on laboratory\nanimals by companies developing products for\nthe cosmetics and\nmedical supply industry. Since advanced\ntesting methods now produce many reliable\nresults without the use of live animals,\nCatholic Advisory Services generally supports\nproposals on this issue. In cases where it can\nbe determined that alternative\ntesting methods are unreliable or are required\nby law, Catholic Advisory Services recommends\nvoting against such proposals. Other\nresolutions call for the adoption of animal\nwelfare standards that would ensure humane\ntreatment of animals on\nvendors\u0092 farms and slaughter houses. Catholic\nAdvisory Services will generally vote in favor\nof such resolutions.\n                                              \n

Charitable Giving\n\nLobbying Efforts\n\nShareholders have asked\ncompanies to report on their lobbying efforts\non proposed legislation or to refute\nestablished scientific research regarding\nclimate change, the health effects of smoking,\nfuel efficiency standards etc. Proponents have\npointed to potential\nlegislation on climate change, the lethargic\npace of improvements in fuel efficiency\nstandards in the U.S. automotive industry, and\nthe highly litigious nature surrounding the\ntobacco industry as rationales for greater\ntransparency on corporate\nlobbying practices that would shed light on\nwhether companies are acting in the best long-\nterm interests of their shareholders.\nProponents of lobbying resolutions typically\nrequest enhanced disclosure of lobbying\npolicies and expenditures, including\na report on the policies and procedures\nrelated to lobbying, amounts used for various\ntypes of lobbying, and any membership or\npayments to a tax-exempt organization that\nwrites and endorses model legislation.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n       companies to review and report on      \n  \u220e    their lobbying activities, including   \n       efforts to                             \n       challenge scientific research and      \n       influence governmental legislation.    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for proposals requesting          \n       information on a company\u0092s lobbying     \n  \u220e    (including direct, indirect, and       \n       grassroots                             \n       lobbying) activities, policies, or     \n       procedures.                            \n                                              \nPolitical Contributions/Non-Partisanship\n\nAs evidenced by the U.S. Supreme Court\u0092s\nJanuary 2010 decision in\nCitizens United vs. Federal Election\nCommission that lifted restrictions on\ncorporate spending in federal elections,\nchanges in legislation that governs corporate\npolitical giving have, rather than limiting\nsuch contributions, increased the\npotential for corporate contributions to the\npolitical process and the complexity of\ntracking such contributions.\n\nProponents of political spending resolutions\ngenerally call for enhanced disclosure of\npolitical contributions, including a report on\nthe policies and procedures for corporate\npolitical campaign contributions and trade\nassociation expenditures, the respective\namounts of such donations using\ncompany funds, or an assessment of the impacts\nof such contributions on the firm\u0092s image,\nsales and profitability. Shareholder advocates\nof these proposals are concerned with the lack\nof transparency on political giving and the\nincreasing\ninvolvement and influence of corporations in\nthe political process.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    79\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for proposals calling for a       \n       company to disclose political and      \n  \u220e    trade association contributions,       \n       unless the                             \n       terms of the proposal are unduly       \n       restrictive.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for proposals calling for a       \n  \u220e    company to maintain a policy of        \n       political                              \n       non-partisanship.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against proposals asking a        \n  \u220e    company to refrain from making any     \n       political contributions.               \n                                              \nCharitable Contributions\n\nShareholder\nproponents of charitable-contributions related\nresolutions may seek greater disclosure on a\ncompany\u0092s charitable donations including\ndollar amounts, sponsorships, and policies on\ncorporate philanthropy. Catholic Advisory\nServices is generally\nsupportive of increased transparency around\ncorporate charitable giving. However, some\nresolutions extend beyond mere disclosure\nrequests and attempt to influence or restrict\ncompanies\u0092 contributions to specific types of\nbeneficiaries in a\nmanner that furthers particular objectives\nsupported by the proposal sponsors. Catholic\nAdvisory Services believes that management is\nbetter positioned to decide what criteria are\nappropriate for making corporate charitable\ncontributions. Also, some\nof the proposals may require companies to poll\ntheir shareholders as part of the grant-making\nprocess. Since majority of companies generally\nhave thousands of shareholders, contacting,\nconfirming, and processing each individual\nopinion and/or\nconsent would be a burdensome and expensive\nexercise.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Generally vote for shareholder         \n  \u220e    resolutions seeking enhanced           \n       transparency on corporate              \n       philanthropy.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against shareholder proposals     \n  \u220e    imposing charitable giving criteria    \n       or requiring shareholder ratification  \n       of grants.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against shareholder proposals     \n  \u220e    requesting that companies prohibit     \n       charitable contributions.              \n                                              \nPolitical Expenditures and Lobbying Congruency\n\nCatholic Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote for proposals\nrequesting greater disclosure of a company\u0092s\nalignment of political contributions,\nlobbying, and electioneering spending with a\ncompany\u0092s publicly stated values and policies,\nunless the terms of the proposal are unduly\nrestrictive.

Although\nthe movement of individuals between government\nand the private sector may benefit both, the\npotential also exists for conflicts of\ninterest, especially in industries that have\nextensive dealings with\ngovernment agencies.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals calling for the\ndisclosure of prior government service of the\ncompany\u0092s key executives.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    80\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nConsumer Lending and Economic Development\n\nAdopt Policy/Report on Predatory Lending\nPractices\n\nPredatory lending involves charging excessive\nfees to subprime borrowers without adequate\ndisclosure. More specifically, predatory\nlending includes misleading\nsubprime borrowers about the terms of a loan,\ncharging excessive fees that are folded into\nthe body of a refinancing loan, including life\ninsurance policies or other unnecessary\nadditions to a mortgage, or lending to\nhomeowners with insufficient\nincome to cover loan payments.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals seeking the\ndevelopment of a policy or preparation of a\nreport to guard against predatory lending\npractices.\n\nDisclosure on Credit in Low-and Lower-middle-\nincome Countries (LMIC) or Forgive LMIC Debt\n\nShareholders have asked banks and other\nfinancial services firms to develop and\ndisclose lending policies for\nlow- and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC).\nProponents are concerned that, without such\npolicies, lending to LMIC may contribute to\nthe outflow of capital, the inefficient use of\ncapital, and corruption,\nall of which increase the risk of loan loss.\nIn the interest of promoting improved LMIC\nlending practices and responsible loan\ndisclosure, Catholic Advisory Services\ngenerally supports voting for such proposals.\nIn cases where it can be determined\nthat companies have been proactive and\nresponsible in developing such policies,\nCatholic Advisory Services may recommend a\nvote against the proposal\u0092s adoption. Catholic\nAdvisory Services usually opposes proposals\nthat call for outright loan\nforgiveness; such action represents an\nunacceptable loss to lending institutions and\ntheir shareholders. Catholic Advisory Services\nmay support such proposals at banks that have\nfailed to make reasonable provisions for\nnon-performing loans as a means to encourage a\nchange in policy.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n       for disclosure on lending practices    \n  \u220e    in low-                                \n       and lower-middle-income countries,     \n       unless the company has demonstrated a  \n       clear proactive record on the issue.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against shareholder proposals     \n  \u220e    asking banks to forgive loans          \n       outright.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on shareholder       \n       proposals asking for loan forgiveness  \n  \u220e    at banks that have failed to make      \n       reasonable provisions for              \n       non-performing loans.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for proposals to restructure and  \n  \u220e    extend the terms of non-performing     \n       loans.                                 \n                                              \nCommunity Investing\n\nShareholders may ask for a company to prepare\na report addressing the company\u0092s community\ninvesting efforts. Such proposals also ask\ncompanies to review their\npolicies regarding their investments in\ndifferent communities.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor proposals that seek a policy review or\nreport addressing the company\u0092s community\ninvesting efforts.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nAdult Entertainment\n\nTraditionally, there have not been many\nproposals filed in the area of adult\nentertainment. However, with the consolidation\nof the\ncommunications industry, a number of large\ncompanies have ended up with ownership of\ncable companies. These cable companies may\noffer their customers access to\npay-per-view programming or channels intended\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    81\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nfor adult audiences. Proponents of shareholder\nproposals on\nthis issue ask cable companies and companies\nwith interests in cable companies to assess\nthe costs and benefits of continuing to\ndistribute sexually-explicit content,\nincluding the potential negative impact on the\ncompany\u0092s image.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals that seek a review\nof the company\u0092s involvement with pornography.\n\nAbortion/Right to Life Issues\n\nShareholder proposals pertaining to abortion\nand right to life issues have appeared more\nfrequently recently, especially in the\naftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court\ndecision overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nHowever, in the past shareholders have asked\ncompanies to stop manufacturing abortifacient\ndrugs; to separate abortifacient drug\noperations from other operations; or to\ndiscontinue acute-care or physician\nmanagement practices that involve support for\nabortion services.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\non shareholder proposals that address right to\nlife issues in a manner consistent with the\nteachings of the Catholic Church on abortion\nand right to life issues.\n\nAnti-Social Proposals\n\nA number of\n\u0091anti-social\u0092 shareholder proposals have been\nfiled at companies requesting increased\ndisclosure. While these proposals\u0092 requests\nare very similar to those submitted by\nshareholder advocates within traditional\nsocially responsible\ninvestor circles, the underlying motives for\nfiling the proposals appear to be very\ndifferent. In addition to charitable\ncontribution proposals, anti-social proposals\naddressing climate change, sustainability, and\nconflicts of interest may be seen\nat shareholder meetings. Despite implicitly\ndifferent motivations in some of these\nproposals, the underlying requests for\nincreased disclosure, in some cases, may be\nworth shareholder support.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote against shareholder proposals     \n  \u220e    that do not seek to ultimately         \n       advance the goals of the social        \n       investment community.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on anti-social       \n  \u220e    shareholder proposals seeking a        \n       review or report on the company\u0092s       \n       charitable contributions.              \n                                              \nViolence and Adult Themes in Video Games\n\nPerceptions of increased sex and violence in\nvideo games have led certain shareholders to\nquestion the availability of\nadult-themed content to children and teens.\nThe Entertainment Software Ratings Board,\nwhich provides ratings for video games, has\nclassified approximately 34 percent of the\ntotal games it reviews as either Teen, Mature,\nor Adults Only.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals asking for reports\non company policies related to the sale of\nmature-rated video games to children and\nteens.\n\nLink Compensation to Non-FinancialFactors\n\nProponents of these proposals feel that social\nand environmental\ncriteria should be factored into the formulas\nused in determining executive compensation\npackages. The shareholder sponsors of the\nresolutions look to companies to review\ncurrent compensation practices and to include\nsocial or environmental\nperformance criteria such as accounting for\n\u0093poor corporate citizenship\u0094 and meeting\nenvironmental or workplace safety objectives\nand metrics when evaluating executive\ncompensation. Some of the\nnon-financial criteria that proponents of\nthese resolutions seek to be incorporated in\ncompensation program design include workplace\nsafety, environmental stewardship, or\ndiversity and customer/employee\nsatisfaction \u0096 as part of a written policy\nused to align compensation with performance on\nnon-financial factors alongside financial\ncriteria.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    82\u00a0of\u00a087  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nProponents believe that factors such as poor\nenvironmental\nperformance, workplace lawsuits, etc. could\nhave a significant adverse impact on a\ncompany\u0092s financial performance if not\nproactively and adequately addressed, and that\nthese factors should be considered along with\ntraditional financial\nconsiderations when determining executive pay.\nThe significant stock price declines and\nmassive losses in shareholder value stemming\nfrom the BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster\nand the tragic explosion at Massey Energy\u0092s\nUpper Big Branch\nmine that killed 29 employees is a sobering\nreminder of the need to have the right\nmanagement incentives in place to ensure that\nsocial and environmental risks are actively\nmanaged and mitigated against. Given the\nproliferation of derivative\nlawsuits targeted at firms such as\nHalliburton, Transocean and Cameron\nInternational that were suppliers to or\npartners with BP in a capacity that ignored\nsafety considerations or that contributed to\nthe economic and ecological disaster,\ninvestors\nare increasingly mindful of the far-reaching\nimplications that exposure to social or\nenvironmental risks could have on shareholder\nvalue at portfolio companies.\n\nCatholic Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       calling for linkage of executive pay   \n       to                                     \n       non-financial factors including        \n  \u220e    performance against social and         \n       environmental goals,                   \n       customer/employee satisfaction,        \n       corporate downsizing, community        \n       involvement, human rights, or          \n       predatory lending.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n  \u220e    seeking reports on linking executive   \n       pay to                                 \n       non-financial factors.                 \n                                              \n                             \n  9.

Board of Directors  \n                            \nVoting on Director Nominees in Uncontested\nElections\n\nFour fundamental principles apply when\ndetermining votes on director nominees:\n\nIndependence:Boards should be sufficiently\nindependent from management (and significant\nshareholders) to ensure that they are able and\nmotivated to effectively supervise\nmanagement\u0092s performance for the benefit of\nall shareholders, including in setting and\nmonitoring the execution of corporate\nstrategy, with appropriate use of shareholder\ncapital, and in setting and monitoring\nexecutive compensation programs that support\nthat strategy. The chair of the board should\nideally be an independent director, and all\nboards should have an independent leadership\nposition or a similar role in order to help\nprovide appropriate counterbalance to\nexecutive management, as well as having\nsufficiently independent committees that focus\non key governance concerns such as audit,\ncompensation, and nomination of directors.\n\nComposition:Companies should ensure that\ndirectors add value to the board through their\nspecific skills and expertise and by having\nsufficient time and commitment to serve\neffectively. Boards should be of a size\nappropriate to accommodate diversity,\nexpertise, and independence, while ensuring\nactive and collaborative participation by all\nmembers. Boards should be sufficiently diverse\nto ensure consideration of a wide range of\nperspectives.\n\nResponsiveness:Directors should respond to\ninvestor input, such as that expressed through\nsignificant opposition to management\nproposals, significant support for shareholder\nproposals (whether binding or non-binding),and\ntender offers where a majority of shares are\ntendered.\n\nAccountability:Boards should be sufficiently\naccountable to shareholders, including through\ntransparency of the company\u0092s governance\npractices and regular board elections, by the\nprovision of sufficient information for\nshareholders to be able to assess directors\nand board composition, and through the ability\nof shareholders to remove directors.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for\ndirector nominees, except under the following\ncircumstances (with new nominees1 considered\non\ncase-by-case basis):\n\nIndependence\n\nVote against2 or withhold from\nnon-independent directors (Executive Directors\nand Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors\nper ISS\u0092 Classification of Directors) when:\n                                              \n  \u220e    Independent directors comprise 50\u00a0     \n       percent or less of the board;          \n                                              \n                                              \n       The non-independent director serves    \n  \u220e    on the audit, compensation, or         \n       nominating                             \n       committee;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       The company lacks an audit,            \n  \u220e    compensation, or nominating committee  \n       so that the full board functions as    \n       that committee; or                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       The company lacks a formal nominating  \n       committee, even if the board attests   \n  \u220e    that the independent directors         \n       fulfill the                            \n       functions of such a committee.         \n                                              \n1 A \u0093new nominee\u0094 is a director who is being\npresented\nfor election by shareholders for the first\ntime.

For private companies, the\nequivalent positions are\napplicable. A non-employee director serving as\nan officer due to statutory requirements (e.g.\ncorporate secretary) will generally be\nclassified as a Non-Independent Non-Executive\nDirector under \u0093Any material relationship with\nthe company.\u0094 However, if the company provides\nexplicit disclosure that the director is not\nreceiving additional compensation exceeding\n$10,000\nper year for serving in that capacity, then\nthe director will be classified as an\nIndependent Director.\n\n2.\n\u0093Affiliate\u0094 includes a subsidiary, sibling\ncompany, or parent company. ISS uses 50\npercent control ownership by the parent\ncompany as the standard for applying its\naffiliate designation. The manager/advisor of\nan externally managed\nissuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate.\n\n3. Includes any former CEO of the company\nprior to the company\u0092s initial\npublic offering (IPO).\n\n4. When there is a former CEO of a special\npurpose acquisition company (SPAC) serving on\nthe board\nof an acquired company, ISS will generally\nclassify such directors as independent unless\ndetermined otherwise taking into account the\nfollowing factors: the applicable listing\nstandards determination of such director\u0092s\nindependence; any\noperating ties to the firm; and the existence\nof any other conflicting relationships or\nrelated party transactions.\n\n5.ISS will look at the terms of the interim\nofficer\u0092s\nemployment contract to determine if it\ncontains severance pay, long-term health and\npension benefits, or other such standard\nprovisions typically contained in contracts of\npermanent, non-temporary CEOs. ISS\nwill also consider if a formal search process\nwas under way for a full-time officer at the\ntime.\n\n6.\u0093Immediate family member\u0094 follows the SEC\u0092s\ndefinition of such and covers spouses,\nparents, children, step-parents, step-\nchildren, siblings,\nin-laws, and any person (other than a tenant\nor employee) sharing the household of any\ndirector, nominee for director, executive\nofficer, or significant shareholder of the\ncompany.\n\n7. Professional services can be characterized\nas advisory in nature, generally involve\naccess to sensitive company information\nor to strategic decision-making, and typically\nhave a commission- or fee-based payment\nstructure. Professional services generally\ninclude but are not limited to the following:\ninvestment banking/financial\nadvisory services, commercial banking (beyond\ndeposit services), investment services,\ninsurance services, accounting/audit services,\nconsulting services, marketing services, legal\nservices, property management services,\nrealtor services, lobbying\nservices, executive search services, and IT\nconsulting services. The following would\ngenerally be considered transactional\nrelationships and not professional services:\ndeposit services, IT tech support services,\neducational services, and\nconstruction services. The case of\nparticipation in a banking syndicate by a non-\nlead bank should be considered a transactional\n(and hence subject to the associated\nmateriality test) rather than a professional\nrelationship. \u0093Of Counsel\u0094 relationships are\nonly considered immaterial if the individual\ndoes not receive any form of compensation (in\nexcess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a\nretired partner of, the firm providing the\nprofessional\nservice. The case of a company providing a\nprofessional service to one of its directors\nor to an entity with which one of its\ndirectors is affiliated, will be considered a\ntransactional rather than a professional\nrelationship. Insurance services and\nmarketing services are assumed to be\nprofessional services unless the company\nexplains why such services are not advisory.\n\n8. A material transactional relationship,\nincluding grants to non-profit organizations,\nexists if the company makes annual payments\nto, or receives annual payments from, another\nentity, exceeding the greater of: $200,000 or\n5 percent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues,\nfor a company that follows NASDAQ listing\nstandards; or\nthe greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the\nrecipient\u0092s gross revenues, for a company that\nfollows NYSE listing standards. For a company\nthat follows neither of the preceding\nstandards, ISS will apply the NASDAQ-based\nmateriality test.\n(The recipient is the party receiving the\nfinancial proceeds from the transaction).\n\n9. Dissident directors who are parties\nto a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement\nor similar arrangement may be classified as\nIndependent Directors if an analysis of the\nfollowing factors indicates that the voting\nagreement does not compromise their alignment\nwith all\nshareholders\u0092 interests: the terms of the\nagreement; the duration of the standstill\nprovision in the agreement; the limitations\nand requirements of actions that are agreed\nupon; if the dissident director nominee(s) is\nsubject to the standstill;\nand if there any conflicting relationships or\nrelated party transactions.\n\n10.Interlocks include: executive officers\nserving as directors on each other\u0092s\ncompensation or similar committees (or, in the\nabsence of such a committee, on the board); or\nexecutive\nofficers sitting on each other\u0092s boards and at\nleast one serves on the other\u0092s compensation\nor similar committees (or, in the absence of\nsuch a committee, on the board).\n\n11.

The\nsubmittal window is the period under which\nshareholders must file their\nproposals/nominations prior to the deadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by\ncompanies to ensure full disclosure in regard\nto a proponent\u0092s economic and voting position\nin the company so long as the informational\nrequirements are reasonable and aimed at\nproviding shareholders with the necessary\ninformation to review\nsuch proposals.\n\nAmend Bylaws without Shareholder Consent\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote against proposals\ngiving the board exclusive authority to amend\nthe bylaws.\n\nVote case-by-case on proposals\ngiving the board the ability to amend the\nbylaws in addition to shareholders, taking\ninto account the following:\n                                              \n       Any impediments to shareholders\u0092        \n  \u220e    ability to amend the bylaws (i.e.      \n       supermajority voting requirements);    \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    The company\u0092s ownership structure and   \n       historical voting turnout;             \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Whether the board could amend bylaws   \n       adopted by shareholders; and           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether shareholders would retain the  \n  \u220e    ability to ratify any board-initiated  \n       amendments.                            \n                                              \nControl Share Acquisition Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to\nopt out of control share acquisition statutes\nunless doing so would enable the completion of\na takeover that would be detrimental to\nshareholders.\n\nVote against proposals to amend the charter to\ninclude control share acquisition provisions.\n\nVote for proposals to restore voting rights to\nthe control shares.\n\nControl\nshare acquisition statutes function by denying\nshares their voting rights when they\ncontribute to ownership in excess of certain\nthresholds. Voting rights for those shares\nexceeding ownership limits may only be\nrestored by approval of either a\nmajority or supermajority of disinterested\nshares. Thus, control share acquisition\nstatutes effectively require a hostile bidder\nto put its offer to a shareholder vote or risk\nvoting disenfranchisement if the bidder\ncontinues buying up a large block\nof shares.\n\nControl Share Cash-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to\nopt out of control share cash-outstatutes.\n\nControl share cash-out statutes give dissident\nshareholders the right to \u0093cash-out\u0094 of their\nposition in a company at the expense of the\nshareholder who has taken a control position.\nIn other words, when an investor crosses a\npreset threshold\nlevel, remaining shareholders are given the\nright to sell their shares to the acquirer,\nwho must buy them at the highest acquiring\nprice.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    17\u00a0of\u00a054  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to\nopt out of state disgorgement provisions.\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or\npotential acquirer of more than a certain\npercentage of a\ncompany\u0092s stock to disgorge, or pay back, to\nthe company any profits realized from the sale\nof that company\u0092s stock purchased 24 months\nbefore achieving control status. All sales of\ncompany stock by the acquirer occurring within\na certain\nperiod of time (between 18 months and 24\nmonths) prior to the investor\u0092s gaining\ncontrol status are subject to these recapture-\nof-profits provisions.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon\nproposals to adopt fair price provisions\n(provisions that stipulate that an acquirer\nmust pay the same price to acquire all shares\nas it paid to acquire the control shares),\nevaluating factors such as the vote required\nto approve the proposed acquisition, the vote\nrequired to repeal the fair price provision,\nand the mechanism for determining the fair\nprice.\n\nGenerally vote against fair price provisions\nwith shareholder vote\nrequirements greater than a majority of\ndisinterested shares.\n\nFreeze-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to\nopt out of state freeze-outprovisions. Freeze-\noutprovisions force an investor who surpasses\na certain ownership threshold in a company to\nwait a specified period of time before gaining\ncontrol of the company.\n\nGreenmail\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to\nadopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw\namendments or otherwise restrict a company\u0092s\nability to make greenmail payments.\n\nVote case-by-case on anti-greenmail proposals\nwhen they are bundled with other charter or\nbylaw amendments.\n\nGreenmail\npayments are targeted share repurchases by\nmanagement of company stock from individuals\nor groups seeking control of the company.\nSince only the hostile party receives payment,\nusually at a substantial premium over the\nmarket value of its shares,\nthe practice discriminates against all other\nshareholders.\n\nShareholder Litigation Rights\n\nFederal Forum Selection Provisions\n\nFederal\nforum selection provisions require that U.S.\nfederal courts be the sole forum for\nshareholders to litigate claims arising under\nfederal securities law.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for\nfederal forum selection provisions in the\ncharter or bylaws that specify \u0093the district\ncourts of the United States\u0094 as the exclusive\nforum for federal securities law matters, in\nthe absence of serious concerns about\ncorporate governance or board responsiveness\nto shareholders.\n\nVote against provisions that restrict the\nforum to a particular federal district court;\nunilateral adoption (without a shareholder\nvote) of such a provision will\ngenerally be considered a one-time failure\nunder the Unilateral Bylaw/Charter\nAmendmentspolicy.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    18\u00a0of\u00a054  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nExclusive Forum Provisions for State Law\nMatters\n\nExclusive forum provisions in the charter or\nbylaws restrict shareholders\u0092 ability to bring\nderivative lawsuits against the company,\nfor claims arising out of state corporate law,\nto the courts of a particular state (generally\nthe state of incorporation).\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for\ncharter or bylaw provisions that specify\ncourts located within the state of Delaware as\nthe exclusive forum for corporate law matters\nfor Delaware corporations, in the absence of\nserious concerns about corporate governance or\nboard responsiveness to shareholders.\n\nFor states other than Delaware, vote case-by-\ncase on exclusive forum provisions,\ntaking into consideration:\n                                              \n  \u220e    The company\u0092s stated rationale for      \n       adopting such a provision;

SVT is expressed as both a dollar\namount and as a percentage of market value,\nand includes the new\nshares proposed, shares available under\nexisting plans, and shares granted but\nunexercised (using two measures, in the case\nof plans subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard\nevaluation, as noted above). All award types\nare valued. For omnibus plans,\nunless limitations are placed on the most\nexpensive types of awards (for example, full-\nvalue awards), the assumption is made that all\nawards to be granted will be the most\nexpensive types.\n\nFor proposals that are not subject to the\nEquity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder\nValue Transfer is reasonable if it falls below\na company-specific benchmark.\nThe benchmark is determined as follows: The\ntop quartile performers in each industry group\n(using the Global Industry Classification\nStandard: GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT\nlevels for each industry are established based\non these top\nperformers\u0092 historic SVT. Regression analyses\nare run on each industry group to identify the\nvariables most strongly correlated to SVT. The\nbenchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted\nupwards or downwards for the specific company\nby plugging\nthe company-specific performance measures,\nsize, and cash compensation into the industry\ncap equations to arrive at the company\u0092s\nbenchmark.21\n\nThree-Year Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\n\nA\n\u0093Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\u0094 is used for stock\nplan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\nbenchmarks are calculated as the greater of:\n(1) an industry-specific threshold based on\nthree-year burn rates within the company\u0092s\nGICS\ngroup segmented by S&P 500, Russell 3000 index\n(less the S&P 500) and non-Russell 3000 index;\nand (2) a deminimisthreshold\n\n21 For plans evaluated under the Equity Plan\nScorecard policy, the company\u0092s SVT benchmark\nis considered along with other factors.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    38\u00a0of\u00a054  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nestablished separately for each of the S&P\n500, the\nRussell 3000 index less the S&P 500, and the\nnon-Russell 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-\nrate benchmark changes will be limited to a\npredetermined range above or below the prior\nyear\u0092s burn-rate\nbenchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate is calculated as\nfollows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn Rate = ((# of options *\noption\u0092s dollar value using a Black-Scholes\nmodel) + (# of full-value awards * stock\nprice)) / (Weighted\naverage common shares * stock price).\n\nEgregious Factors\n\nLiberal Change in Control Definition\n\nGenerally vote against equity plans if the\nplan has a liberal definition of change in\ncontrol and the equity awards could vest upon\nsuch liberal definition of change\nin control, even though an actual change in\ncontrol may not occur. Examples of such a\ndefinition include, but are not limited to,\nannouncement or commencement of a tender\noffer, provisions for acceleration upon a\n\u0093potential\u0094 takeover,\nshareholder approval of a merger or other\ntransactions, or similar language.\n\nRepricing Provisions\n\nVote against plans that expressly permit the\nrepricing or exchange of underwater stock\noptions/stock appreciate rights (SARs) without\nprior shareholder approval.\n\u0093Repricing\u0094 typically includes the ability to\ndo any of the following:\n                                              \n       Amend the terms of outstanding         \n  \u220e    options or SARs to reduce the          \n       exercise price of such outstanding     \n       options or SARs;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Cancel outstanding options or SARs in  \n       exchange for options or SARs with an   \n  \u220e    exercise price that is less than the   \n       exercise                               \n       price of the original options or       \n       SARs;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Cancel underwater options in exchange  \n       for stock awards; or                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Provide cash buyouts of underwater     \n       options.                               \n                                              \nWhile the above cover most types of repricing,\nISS may view other provisions as akin to\nrepricing depending on the facts and\ncircumstances.\n\nAlso, vote against or withhold from members of\nthe Compensation Committee who approved\nrepricing (as defined above or otherwise\ndetermined by ISS), without prior\nshareholder approval, even if such repricings\nare allowed in their equity plan.\n\nVote against plans that do not expressly\nprohibit repricing or cash buyout of\nunderwater options without shareholder\napproval if the company has a history of\nrepricing/buyouts without shareholder\napproval, and the applicable listing standards\nwould not preclude them from doing so.\n\nProblematic Pay Practices or Significant Pay-\nfor-PerformanceDisconnect\n\nIf the equity plan on the ballot is a vehicle\nforproblematic pay practices, vote against the\nplan.\n\nISS may recommend a vote against the equity\nplan if the plan is determined to be\na vehicle for pay-for-performance\nmisalignment. Considerations in voting against\nthe equity plan may include, but are not\nlimited to:\n                                            \n  \u220e    Severity of the pay-for-performance  \n       misalignment;                        \n                                            \n                                              \n       Whether problematic equity grant       \n  \u220e    practices are driving the              \n       misalignment; and/or                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Whether equity plan awards have been   \n  \u220e    heavily concentrated to the CEO        \n       and/or the other NEOs.                 \n                                              \nAmending Cash and Equity Plans (including\nApproval for Tax Deductibility (162(m))\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon\namendments to cash and equity incentive plans.\n\nGenerally vote for proposals to amend\nexecutive\ncash, stock, or cash and stock incentive plans\nif the proposal:\n                                              \n  \u220e    Addresses administrative features      \n       only; or                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    39\u00a0of\u00a054  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Seeks approval for Section\u00a0162(m)      \n       purposes only, and the plan            \n       administering committee consists       \n       entirely of                            \n       independent directors, per ISS\u0092         \n       Classification of Directors.

In voting their\nshares, socially responsible institutional\nshareholders are concerned not only with\nsustainable economic returns to shareholders\nand good corporate governance but also with\nthe ethical behavior of corporations and the\nsocial and environmental impact\nof their actions.\n\nSocial Advisory Services has, therefore,\ndeveloped proxy voting guidelines that are\nconsistent with the dual objectives of\nsocially responsible\nshareholders. On matters of social and\nenvironmental import, the guidelines seek to\nreflect a broad consensus of the socially\nresponsible investing community. Generally, we\ntake as our frame of reference policies that\nhave been developed by groups\nsuch as the Interfaith Center on Corporate\nResponsibility, the General Board of Pension\nand Health Benefits of the United Methodist\nChurch, Domini Social Investments, and other\nleading church shareholders and socially\nresponsible mutual fund\ncompanies. Additionally, we incorporate the\nactive ownership and investment philosophies\nof leading globally recognized initiatives\nsuch as the United Nations Environment\nProgramme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the\nUnited Nations Principles for\nResponsible Investment (UNPRI), the United\nNations Global Compact, and environmental and\nsocial European Union Directives.\n\nOn matters of corporate governance,\nexecutive compensation, and corporate\nstructure, Social Advisory Services guidelines\nare based on a commitment to create and\npreserve economic value and to advance\nprinciples of good corporate governance\nconsistent with responsibilities to society\nas a whole.\n\nThe guidelines provide an overview of how\nSocial Advisory Services recommends that its\nclients vote. We note that there may be cases\nin which the\nfinal vote recommendation on a particular\ncompany varies from the vote guideline due to\nthe fact that we closely examine the merits of\neach proposal and consider relevant\ninformation and company-specific circumstances\nin arriving at our decisions.\nWhere Social Advisory Services acts as voting\nagent for its clients, it follows each\nclient\u0092s voting policy, which may differ in\nsome cases from the policies outlined in this\ndocument. Social Advisory Services updates its\nguidelines on an\nannual basis to take into account emerging\nissues and trends on environmental, social,\nand corporate governance topics, in addition\nto evolving market standards, regulatory\nchanges, and client feedback.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C    2\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                   \n                                              \n1. Board of Directors\n\nA corporation\u0092s board of directors sits at the\napogee of the corporate governance system.\nThough they normally delegate\nresponsibility for the management of the\nbusiness to the senior executives they select\nand oversee, directors bear ultimate\nresponsibility for the conduct of the\ncorporation\u0092s business. The role of directors\nin publicly held corporations has\nundergone considerable change in recent years.\nOnce derided as rubber stamps for management,\ndirectors of public corporations today are\nexpected to serve as effective guardians of\nshareholders\u0092 interests.\n\nVoting on directors and board-related issues\nis the most important use of the shareholder\nfranchise, not simply a routine proxy item.\nAlthough uncontested director\nelections do not present alternative nominees\nfrom whom to choose, a high percentage of\nopposition votes is an expression of\nshareholder dissatisfaction and should be\nsufficient to elicit a meaningful response\nfrom management.\n\nThe role and responsibilities of directors has\nincreasingly been the subject of much\ndiscussion and debate, given the current\neconomic climate and the difficulties\nmany companies now face in their respective\nmarkets. Influential organizations, including\nthe American Law Institute, the American Bar\nAssociation, the National Association of\nCorporate Directors, and the Business\nRoundtable have issued reports and\nrecommendations regarding the duties and\naccountability of corporate boards. Both\nmainstream and alternative media outlets have\nhighlighted the numerous gaps within risk\noversight of company boards and individual\ndirectors, and many institutional\ninvestors, in response, have capitalized on\ntheir rights as stakeholders to prompt\nchanges. Corporations have taken notice,\nimplementing many of the reforms championed by\ntheir shareholders.\n\nAlthough differences of opinion remain, a\nfairly strong consensus has emerged on a\nnumber of key issues. It is widely agreed that\nthe board\u0092s most important\nresponsibility is to ensure that the\ncorporation is managed in the shareholders\u0092\nbest long-term economic interest. This will\noften require boards to consider the impact of\ntheir actions on other constituencies,\nincluding employees, customers,\nlocal communities, and the environment.\n                                              \n       The board\u0092s principal functions are     \n  \u220e    widely agreed to consist of the        \n       following:                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       To select, evaluate, and if            \n  \u220e    necessary, replace management,         \n       including the chief executive          \n       officer;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    To review and approve major            \n       strategies and financial objectives;   \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    To advise management on significant    \n       issues;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       To assure that effective controls are  \n  \u220e    in place to safeguard corporate        \n       assets, manage risk, and comply with   \n       the law; and                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       To nominate directors and otherwise    \n  \u220e    ensure that the board functions        \n       effectively.                           \n                                              \nBoards are expected to have a majority of\ndirectors independent of management. The\nindependent directors are expected to organize\nmuch of the board\u0092s work, even\nif the chief executive officer also serves as\nChairman of the board. Key committees of the\nboard are expected to be entirely independent\nof management. It is expected that boards will\nengage in critical self-evaluation of\nthemselves and of\nindividual members. Individual directors, in\nturn, are expected to devote significant\namounts of time to their duties, to limit the\nnumber of directorships they accept, and to\nown a meaningful amount of stock in companies\non whose boards they serve.\nDirectors are ultimately responsible to the\ncorporation\u0092s shareholders. The most direct\nexpression of this responsibility is the\nrequirement that directors be elected to their\npositions by the shareholders. Shareholders\nare also asked to vote\non a number of other matters regarding the\nrole, structure, and composition of the board.\nSocial Advisory Services classifies directors\nas either executive, non-independent non-\nexecutive, or independent directors.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C    3\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                   \n                                              \nUncontested Election of Directors\n\nFour broad principles apply when determining\nvotes on director nominees:\n                                              \n        Board Accountability: Accountability  \n        refers to the promotion of            \n        transparency into a company\u0092s          \n        governance practices and annual       \n        board elections and the provision     \n  1.    to shareholders the ability to        \n        remove problematic directors and to   \n        vote on takeover defenses or other    \n        charter/bylaw amendments.

For private companies, the\nequivalent positions are\napplicable. A non-employee director serving as\nan officer due to statutory requirements (e.g.\ncorporate secretary) will generally be\nclassified as a Non-Independent Non-Executive\nDirector under \u0093Any material relationship with\nthe company.\u0094 However, if the company provides\nexplicit disclosure that the director is not\nreceiving additional compensation exceeding\n$10,000\nper year for serving in that capacity, then\nthe director will be classified as an\nIndependent Director.\n\nii\n\u0093Affiliate\u0094 includes a subsidiary, sibling\ncompany, or parent company. Social Advisory\nServices uses 50 percent control ownership by\nthe parent company as the standard for\napplying its affiliate designation. The\nmanager/advisor of an\nexternally managed issuer (EMI) is considered\nan affiliate.\n\niii Includes any former CEO of the company\nprior to the\ncompany\u0092s initial public offering (IPO).\n\niv When there is\na former CEO of a special purpose acquisition\ncompany (SPAC) serving on the board of an\nacquired company, Social Advisory Services\nwill generally classify such directors as\nindependent unless determined otherwise taking\ninto account the following\nfactors: the applicable listing standards\ndetermination of such director\u0092s independence;\nany operating ties to the firm; and the\nexistence of any other conflicting\nrelationships or related party transactions.\n\nvSocial Advisory Services will look at the\nterms of the interim\nofficer\u0092s employment contract to determine if\nit contains severance pay, long-term health\nand pension benefits, or other such standard\nprovisions typically contained in contracts of\npermanent,\nnon-temporary CEOs. Social Advisory Services\nwill also consider if a formal search process\nwas under way for a full-time officer at the\ntime.\n\nvi\u0093Immediate family member\u0094 follows the SEC\u0092s\ndefinition of such and covers spouses,\nparents, children, step-parents, step-\nchildren, siblings, in-laws, and any person\n(other than a tenant or employee) sharing the\nhousehold of any director, nominee for\ndirector, executive officer, or significant\nshareholder of the company.\n\nvii Professional services can be characterized\nas advisory in\nnature, generally involve access to sensitive\ncompany information or to strategic decision-\nmaking, and typically have a commission- or\nfee-based payment structure. Professional\nservices generally include, but\nare not limited to the following: investment\nbanking/financial advisory services;\ncommercial banking (beyond deposit services);\ninvestment services; insurance services;\naccounting/audit services; consulting\nservicees; marketing services; legal\nservices; property management services;\nrealtor services; lobbying services; executive\nsearch services; and IT consulting services.\nThe following would generally be considered\ntransactional relationships and not\nprofessional services: deposit\nservices; IT tech support services;\neducational services; and construction\nservices. The case of participation in a\nbanking syndicate by a non-lead bank should be\nconsidered a transactional (and hence subject\nto the associated materiality test) rather\nthan a professional relationship. \u0093Of Counsel\u0094\nrelationships are only considered immaterial\nif the individual does not receive any form of\ncompensation (in excess of $10,000 per year)\nfrom, or is\na retired partner of, the firm providing the\nprofessional service. The case of a company\nproviding a professional service to one of its\ndirectors or to an entity with which one of\nits directors is affiliated, will be\nconsidered a transactional\nrather than a professional relationship.\nInsurance services and marketing services are\nassumed to be professional services unless the\ncompany explains why such services are not\nadvisory.\n\nviii A material transactional relationship,\nincluding grants to non-profit organizations,\nexists if the company makes annual payments\nto, or receives annual payments from, another\nentity exceeding the greater of $200,000 or 5\npercent of the recipient\u0092s gross revenues,\nin the case of a company which follows NASDAQ\nlisting standards; or the greater of\n$1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient\u0092s\ngross revenues, in the case of a company which\nfollows NYSE listing standards. In the case of\na company which\nfollows neither of the preceding standards,\nSocial Advisory Services will apply the\nNASDAQ-based materiality test. (The recipient\nis the party receiving the financial proceeds\nfrom the transaction).\n\nix Dissident directors who are parties to a\nvoting agreement pursuant to a settlement or\nsimilar arrangement may be classified as\nindependent directors if an analysis of the\nfollowing factors indicates that the voting\nagreement does not compromise their alignment\nwith all shareholders\u0092\ninterests: the terms of the agreement; the\nduration of the standstill\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    12\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nprovision in the agreement; the limitations\nand requirements of actions that are agreed\nupon; if the dissident\ndirector nominee(s) is subject to the\nstandstill; and if there any conflicting\nrelationships or related party transactions.\n\nxInterlocks include: executive officers\nserving as directors on\neach other\u0092s compensation or similar\ncommittees (or, in the absence of such a\ncommittee, on the board); or executive\nofficers sitting on each other\u0092s boards and at\nleast one serves on the other\u0092s compensation\nor similar committees\n(or, in the absence of such a committee, on\nthe board).\n\nxi The operating\ninvolvement of the founder with the company\nwill be considered; if the founder was never\nemployed by the company, Social Advisory\nServices may deem him or her an independent\noutsider.\n\nxii For purposes of Social Advisory Services\u0092\ndirector\nindependence classification, \u0093material\u0094 will\nbe defined as a standard of relationship\n(financial, personal or otherwise) that a\nreasonable person might conclude could\npotentially influence one\u0092s objectivity in the\nboardroom in a\nmanner that would have a meaningful impact on\nan individual\u0092s ability to satisfy requisite\nfiduciary standards on behalf of shareholders.\n                                              \n   Board-Related Management Proposals         \n                                              \nClassification/Declassification of the Board\n\nUnder a classified board structure only one\nclass of directors would stand for election\neach year, and the directors in each class\nwould generally serve three-year\nterms. Although staggered boards can provide\ncontinuity for companies at the board level,\nthere are also a number of downsides to the\nstructure. First, a classified board can also\nbe used to entrench management and effectively\npreclude most takeover\nbids or proxy contests. Board classification\nforces dissidents and would-be acquirers to\nnegotiate with the incumbent board, which has\nthe authority to decide on offers without a\nshareholder vote. In addition,\nwhen a board is classified, it is difficult to\nremove individual members for either poor\nattendance or poor performance; shareholders\nwould only have the chance to vote on a given\ndirector every third year when he or she comes\nup for election. The\nclassified board structure can also limit\nshareholders\u0092 ability to withhold votes from\ninside directors that sit on key board\ncommittee, or to withhold votes from an entire\nboard slate to protest the lack of board\ndiversity. According to\nISS\u0092 2012 Board Practices study, the number of\nS&P 500 companies with classified boards has\ncontinued to fall. In 2015, only 17 percent of\nS&P 500 companies maintained staggered boards,\ncompared to 25 percent in 2014,\n30 percent in 2013, and 39 percent in 2010.\nWhile we recognize that there are some\nadvantages to classified boards, based on the\nlatest studies on classified boards, the fact\nthat classified boards can make it more\ndifficult for\nshareholders to remove individual directors,\nand the fact that classified boards can be\nused as an antitakeover device, Social\nAdvisory Services recommends against the\nadoption of classified boards.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for proposals to repeal           \n  \u220e    classified boards and to elect all     \n       directors annually.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote against proposals to classify     \n       (stagger) the board of directors.      \n                                              \nMajority Vote Threshold for Director Elections\n\nSocial Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote for management\nproposals to adopt a majority of votes cast\nstandard for directors in uncontested\nelections.\n\nVote against if no\ncarve-out for plurality in contested elections\nis included.\n\nCumulative Voting\n\nMost corporations provide that shareholders\nare entitled to cast one vote for each share\nowned.

Social\nAdvisory Services supports management\nproposals to fix the size of the board at a\nspecific number, thus\npreventing management, when facing a proxy\ncontest, from increasing the board size\nwithout shareholder approval. By increasing\nthe size of the board, management can make it\nmore difficult for dissidents to gain control\nof the board. Fixing the size\nof the board also prevents a reduction in the\nsize of the board as a strategy to oust\nindependent directors. Fixing board size also\nprevents management from increasing the number\nof directors in order to dilute the effects of\ncumulative voting.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote for proposals that seek to fix    \n       the size of the board.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on proposals that    \n  \u220e    seek                                   \n       to change the size or range of the     \n       board.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against proposals that give       \n       management the ability to alter the    \n  \u220e    size of the board outside of a         \n       specific range                         \n       without shareholder approval.          \n                                              \nEstablish/Amend Nominee Qualifications\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon proposals that establish or\namend director qualifications.

Social\nAdvisory Services believes shareholders should\nhave a greater voice in the\nelection of directors and believes majority\nthreshold voting represents a viable\nalternative to the plurality system in the\nU.S. Companies are strongly encouraged to also\nadopt a post-election policy (also known as a\ndirector resignation policy)\nthat will provide guidelines so that the\ncompany will promptly address the situation of\na holdover director.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor precatory and binding resolutions\nrequesting that the board change the company\u0092s\nbylaws to stipulate that directors need to be\nelected with an affirmative majority of votes\ncast, provided it does not conflict with the\nstate law where the company is incorporated.\nBinding resolutions need to allow for a carve-\noutfor a plurality vote standard when there\nare more nominees than board seats.\n\nMajority of Independent Directors\n\nSocial\nAdvisory Services believes that a board\nindependent from management is of vital\nimportance to a company and its shareholders.\nAccordingly, Social Advisory Services will\ncast votes in a manner that shall encourage\nthe independence of boards.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    16\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n       that a majority or more of directors   \n       be independent unless the board        \n  \u220e    composition                            \n       already meets the proposed threshold   \n       by Social Advisory Services\u0092            \n       definition of independence.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals to      \n  \u220e    strengthen the definition of           \n       independence for board directors.      \n                                              \nEstablishment of Independent Committees\n\nMost corporate governance experts agree that\nthe key board committees (audit, compensation,\nand nominating/corporate governance) of a\ncorporation should include only\nindependent directors. The independence of key\ncommittees has been encouraged by regulation.\nSocial Advisory Services believes that\ninitiatives to increase the independent\nrepresentation of these committees or to\nrequire that these committees be\nindependent should be supported.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals asking that board\naudit, compensation, and/or nominating\ncommittees be composed exclusively of\nindependent directors.\n\nIndependent Board Chair\n\nOne of the\nprinciple functions of the board is to monitor\nand evaluate the performance of the CEO. The\nchairperson\u0092s duty to oversee management is\nobviously compromised when he or she is\nrequired to monitor himself or herself.\nGenerally Social Advisory\nServices recommends a vote for shareholder\nproposals that would require that the position\nof board chair be held by an individual with\nno materials ties to the company other than\ntheir board seat.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals that would require\nthe board chair to be independent of\nmanagement.\n\nEstablishment of Board Committees\n\nSocial Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote for shareholder\nproposals to establish a new board committee\nto address broad corporate policy topics or to\nprovide a forum for ongoing dialogue on issues\nsuch as the environment, human or labor\nrights, shareholder relations, occupational\nhealth and safety etc. when the formation of\nsuch committees appears to be a potentially\neffective method of protecting or enhancing\nshareholder value.

Ratification of Auditors  \n                                  \nAnnual election of the outside accountants is\nbest\npractice standard. While it is recognized that\nthe company is in the best position to\nevaluate the competence of the outside\naccountants, we believe that outside\naccountants must ultimately be accountable to\nshareholders. A Blue Ribbon Commission\nreport concluded that audit committees must\nimprove their current level of oversight of\nindependent accountants. Given the rash of\naccounting misdeeds that were not detected by\naudit panels or auditors, shareholder\nratification is an essential step\nin restoring investor confidence. Shareholders\nshould have the right to weigh in on the\nchoice of the audit firm, and all companies\nshould put ratification on the ballot of their\nannual meeting. Special consideration will be\ngiven when non-audit fees exceed audit fees,\nas high non-audit fees can compromise the\nindependence of the auditor. Social Advisory\nServices will also monitor both auditor tenure\nand\nwhether auditor ratification has been pulled\nfrom the ballot.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nforproposals to ratify auditors, unless any of\nthe following apply:\n                                              \n       The non-audit fees paid represent 25\u00a0  \n  \u220e    percent or more of the total fees      \n       paid                                   \n       to the auditor;                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       An auditor has a financial interest    \n  \u220e    in or association with the company,    \n       and is therefore not independent;      \n                                              \n                                              \n       There is reason to believe that the    \n       independent auditor has rendered an    \n  \u220e    opinion that is neither accurate nor   \n       indicative                             \n       of the company\u0092s financial position;    \n       or                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Poor accounting practices are          \n       identified that rise to a serious      \n  \u220e    level of concern, such as: fraud;      \n       misapplication of GAAP;                \n       and material weaknesses identified in  \n       Section\u00a0404 disclosures.               \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    19\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nAuditor-Related Shareholder Proposals\n\nRatify Auditors/Ensure Auditor Independence\n\nThese shareholder proposals request that the\nboard allow shareholders to ratify the\ncompany\u0092s auditor at each annual meeting.\nAnnual ratification of the outside\naccountants is standard practice. While it is\nrecognized that the company is in the best\nposition to evaluate the competence of the\noutside accountants, we believe that outside\naccountants must ultimately be accountable to\nshareholders.\n\nGiven the rash of accounting irregularities\nthat were not detected by audit panels or\nauditors, shareholder ratification is an\nessential step in restoring investor\nconfidence. Social Advisory Services believes\nthat shareholders should have the ability to\nratify the auditor on an annual basis.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals to      \n  \u220e    allow shareholders to vote on auditor  \n       ratification.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for proposals that ask a company  \n  \u220e    to adopt a policy on auditor           \n       independence.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for proposals that seek to limit  \n  \u220e    the non-audit services provided by     \n       the                                    \n       company\u0092s auditor.                      \n                                              \nAuditor Rotation\n\nTo minimize any conflict of interest that may\nrise between the company and its auditor,\nSocial Advisory Services supports the rotation\nof auditors. Currently, SEC\nrules provide that partners should be rotated\nevery five years. However, Social Advisory\nServices also believes that the long tenure of\naudit firms at U.S. companies can be\nproblematic.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals to rotate company\u0092s\nauditor every five years or more. Social\nAdvisory Services believes that proposing a\nrotation period less than five years is\nunreasonably restrictive and may negatively\naffect audit quality and service while\nincreasing expense.\n                                              \n  3.    Takeover Defenses / Shareholder       \n        Rights                                \n                                              \nCorporate takeover attempts come in\nvarious guises. Usually, a would-be acquirer\nmakes a direct offer to the board of directors\nof a targeted corporation. The bidder may\noffer to purchase the company for cash and/or\nstock. If the board approves\nthe offer, a friendly transaction is completed\nand presented to shareholders for approval.\nIf, however, the board of directors rejects\nthe bid, the acquirer can make a tender offer\nfor the shares directly to the targeted\ncorporation\u0092s\nshareholders. Such offers are referred to as\nhostile tender bids.\n\nNot wishing to wait until they are subjects of\nhostile takeover attempts, many corporations\nhave adopted antitakeover measures designed to\ndeter unfriendly bids or buy time. The most\ncommon defenses are the shareholders rights\nprotection plan, also known as the poison\npill, and charter amendments that create\nbarriers to acceptance of\nhostile bids. In the U.S., poison pills do not\nrequire shareholder approval. However,\nshareholders must approve charter amendments,\nsuch as classified boards or supermajority\nvote requirements. In brief, the very\nexistence of defensive measures can\nforeclose the possibility of tenders and\nhence, opportunities to premium prices for\nshareholders.\n\nAnti-takeover statutes generally increase\nmanagement\u0092s\npotential for insulating itself and warding\noff hostile takeovers that may be beneficial\nto shareholders. While it may be true that\nsome boards use such devices to obtain higher\nbids and to enhance shareholder value, it is\nmore likely that such\nprovisions are used to entrench management.\nThe majority of historical evidence on\nindividual corporate anti-takeover measures\nindicates that heavily insulated companies\ngenerally realize lower returns than those\nhaving managements that are more\naccountable to shareholders and the market.\nThe evidence also suggests that when states\nadopt their own anti-takeover devices, or\nendorse those employed by firms, shareholder\nreturns are harmed. Moreover, the body of\nevidence appears to indicate\nthat companies in states with the strongest\nanti-takeover laws experience lower returns\nthan they would absent such statutes.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    20\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nTakeover Defenses and Shareholder Rights-\nRelated Management Proposals\n\nPoison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plans)\n\nPoison pills are corporate-sponsored financial\ndevices that, when triggered by potential\nacquirers, do one or more of the following: 1)\ndilute the acquirer\u0092s\nequity holdings in the target company; 2)\ndilute the acquirer\u0092s voting interests in the\ntarget company; or 3) dilute the acquirer\u0092s\nequity holdings in the post-merger company.\nPoison pills generally allow shareholders to\npurchase shares\nfrom, or sell shares back to, the target\ncompany (flip-in pill) and/or the potential\nacquirer (flip-out pill) at a price far out of\nline with fair market value.\nDepending on the type of pill, the triggering\nevent can either transfer wealth from the\ntarget company or dilute the equity holdings\nof current shareholders. Poison pills insulate\nmanagement from the threat of a change in\ncontrol and provide the\ntarget board with veto power over takeover\nbids. Because poison pills greatly alter the\nbalance of power between shareholders and\nmanagement, shareholders should be allowed to\nmake their own evaluation of such plans.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon management proposals on poison\npill ratification, focusing on the features of\nthe shareholder rights plan.

In examining the request for the\npill, take into consideration the\ncompany\u0092s existing governance structure,\nincluding: board independence, existing\ntakeover defenses, and any problematic\ngovernance concerns.\n\nNet Operating Loss (NOL) Poison\nPills/Protective Amendments\n\nThe financial crisis has prompted widespread\nlosses in certain\nindustries. This has resulted in previously\nprofitable companies considering the adoption\nof a poison pill and/or NOL protective\namendment to protect their NOL tax assets,\nwhich may be lost upon an acquisition of 5\npercent of a company\u0092s\nshares.\n\nWhen evaluating management proposals seeking\nto adopt NOL pills or protective amendments,\nthe purpose behind the proposal, its terms,\nand the\ncompany\u0092s existing governance structure should\nbe taken into account to assess whether the\nstructure actively promotes board entrenchment\nor adequately protects shareholder rights.\nWhile Social Advisory Services acknowledges\nthe high estimated\ntax value of NOLs, which benefit shareholders,\nthe ownership acquisition limitations\ncontained in an NOL pill/protective amendment\ncoupled with a company\u0092s problematic\ngovernance structure could serve as an\nantitakeover device.\n\nGiven the fact that shareholders will want to\nensure that such an amendment does not remain\nin effect permanently, Social Advisory\nServices will also closely review\nwhether the pill/amendment contains a sunset\nprovision or a commitment to cause the\nexpiration of the NOL pill/protective\namendment upon exhaustion or expiration of the\nNOLs.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nagainst proposals to adopt a poison pill for\nthe stated purpose of protecting a company\u0092s\nnet operating losses (\u0093NOLs\u0094) if the term of\nthe pill would exceed the shorter of three\nyears and the exhaustion of the NOL.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    21\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nVote case-by-case on management proposals for\npoison pill ratification, considering the\nfollowing factors, if the term of the pill\nwould be the shorter of three years (or less)\nand the exhaustion of the NOL:\n                                              \n       The ownership threshold to transfer    \n  \u220e    (NOL pills generally have a trigger    \n       slightly below 5%);

These recent court decisions\nhave encouraged companies to take a closer\nlook at their bylaw provisions to ensure that\nbroad language does not provide loopholes for\nactivist investors.\nSpecifically, companies are including language\ndesigned to provide more detailed advance\nnotice provisions and to ensure full\ndisclosure of economic and voting interests in\na shareholder\u0092s notice of proposals, including\nderivatives and hedged\npositions.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon advance notice proposals,\ngiving support to those proposals which allow\nshareholders to submit proposals/nominations\nas close to the meeting date as reasonably\npossible and within the broadest window\npossible, recognizing the need to allow\nsufficient notice for company, regulatory and\nshareholder review.\n\nTo be\nreasonable, the company\u0092s deadline for\nshareholder notice of a proposal/ nominations\nmust be no earlier than 120 days prior to the\nanniversary of the previous year\u0092s meeting and\nhave a submittal window of no shorter than 30\ndays from the\nbeginning of the notice period (also known as\na 90-120 day window).The submittal window is\nthe period under which shareholders must file\ntheir proposals/nominations prior to the\ndeadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by\ncompanies to ensure full disclosure in regard\nto a proponent\u0092s economic and voting position\nin the company so long as\nthe informational requirements are reasonable\nand aimed at providing shareholders with the\nnecessary information to review such\nproposals.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nFair price\nprovisions were originally designed to\nspecifically defend against the most coercive\nof takeover devises, the two-tiered, front-end\nloaded tender offer. In such a\nhostile takeover, the bidder offers cash for\nenough shares to gain control of the target.\nAt the same time the acquirer states that once\ncontrol has been obtained, the target\u0092s\nremaining shares will be purchased with cash,\ncash and securities\nor only securities. Since the payment offered\nfor the remaining stock is, by design less\nvaluable than the original offer for the\ncontrolling shares, shareholders are forced to\nsell out early to maximize their value.\nStandard fair price provisions\nrequire that, absent board or shareholder\napproval of the acquisition, the bidder must\npay the remaining shareholders the same price\nfor their shares that brought control.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on proposals to      \n       adopt                                  \n       fair price provisions evaluating       \n  \u220e    factors such as the vote required to   \n       approve the proposed acquisition, the  \n       vote required to repeal the fair       \n       price provision, and the mechanism     \n       for determining the fair price.        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Generally, vote against fair price     \n       provisions with shareholder vote       \n  \u220e    requirements greater than a majority   \n       of disinterested                       \n       shares.                                \n                                              \nGreenmail\n\nGreenmail payments are targeted share\nrepurchases by management of company stock\nfrom individuals or groups seeking control of\nthe company. Since only the hostile\nparty receives payment, usually at a\nsubstantial premium over the market value of\nshares, the practice discriminates against\nmost shareholders.

It ensures that all votes\nare based on the\nmerits of proposals and cast in the best\ninterests of fiduciary clients and pension\nplan beneficiaries. In a confidential voting\nsystem, only vote tabulators and inspectors of\nelection may examine individual proxies and\nballots; management and\nshareholders are given only vote totals. In an\nopen voting system, management can determine\nwho has voted against its nominees or\nproposals and then re-solicit those votes\nbefore the final vote count. As a\nresult, shareholders can be pressured to vote\nwith management at companies with which they\nmaintain, or would like to establish, a\nbusiness relationship. Confidential voting\nalso protects employee shareholders from\nretaliation. Shares held by\nemployee stock ownership plans, for example,\nare important votes that are typically voted\nby employees.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nformanagement proposals to adopt confidential\nvoting.\n\nControl Share Acquisition Provisions\n\nControl share acquisition statutes function by\ndenying shares their voting rights when they\ncontribute to ownership in excess of certain\nthresholds. Voting rights for\nthose shares exceeding ownership limits may\nonly be restored by approval of either a\nmajority or supermajority of disinterested\nshares. Thus, control share acquisition\nstatutes effectively require a hostile bidder\nto put its offer to a shareholder\nvote or risk voting disenfranchisement if the\nbidder continues buying up a large block of\nshares.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for proposals to opt out of       \n       control share acquisition statutes     \n  \u220e    unless doing so would enable the       \n       completion of a                        \n       takeover that would be detrimental to  \n       shareholders.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against proposals to amend the    \n  \u220e    charter to include control share       \n       acquisition provisions.                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote for proposals to restore voting   \n       rights to the control shares.          \n                                              \nControl Share Cash-OutProvisions\n\nControl share cash-out statutes give dissident\nshareholders the right to\n\u0093cash-out\u0094 of their position in a company at\nthe expense of the shareholder who has taken a\ncontrol position. In other words, when an\ninvestor crosses a preset threshold level,\nremaining shareholders\nare given the right to sell their shares to\nthe acquirer, who must buy them at the highest\nacquiring price.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor proposals to opt out of control share\ncash-outstatutes.\n\nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or\npotential acquirer of more than a certain\npercentage of a company\u0092s stock to disgorge,\nor pay back, to the company\nany profits realized from the sale of that\ncompany\u0092s stock purchased 24 months before\nachieving control status.

The debate\nover antitakeover devices centers on whether\nthese devices enhance or detract from\nshareholder value. One theory argues that a\ncompany\u0092s board, when armed with these\ntakeover protections, may use\nthem as negotiating tools to obtain a higher\npremium for shareholders.

Dual class exchange\noffers involve a transfer of voting rights\nfrom one group of shareholders to another\ngroup of shareholders typically through the\npayment of a preferential\ndividend. A dual class recapitalization also\nestablishes two classes of common stock with\nunequal voting rights, but initially involves\nan equal distribution of preferential and\ninferior voting shares to current\nshareholders.\n\nSocial Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote against\nproposals to create a new class of common\nstock unless:\n                                              \n       The company discloses a compelling     \n       rationale for the dual-class capital   \n       structure, including: a) the company\u0092s  \n  \u220e    auditor has concluded that there is    \n       substantial doubt about the company\u0092s   \n       ability to continue as a going         \n       concern; or b) the new class of        \n       shares will be transitory;             \n                                              \n                                              \n       The new class is intended for          \n       financing purposes with minimal or no  \n  \u220e    dilution to current shareholders in    \n       both the short                         \n       term and long term;                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       The new class is not designed to       \n  \u220e    preserve or increase the voting power  \n       of an insider or significant           \n       shareholder.                           \n                                              \nPreemptive Rights\n\nPreemptive rights permit shareholders to share\nproportionately in any new issues of stock of\nthe same class. These rights guarantee\nexisting shareholders the first\nopportunity to purchase shares of new issues\nof stock in the same class as their own and in\nthe same proportion. The absence of these\nrights could cause stockholders\u0092 interest in a\ncompany to be reduced by the sale of\nadditional shares without\ntheir knowledge and at prices unfavorable to\nthem. Preemptive rights, however, can make it\ndifficult for corporations to issue large\nblocks of stock for general corporate\npurposes. Both corporations and shareholders\nbenefit when corporations are\nable to arrange issues without preemptive\nrights that do not result in a substantial\ntransfer of control.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Review\non a case-by-casebasis proposals to create or\nabolish preemptive rights.

Executive and Director Compensation  \n                                             \nThe global financial crisis resulted in\nsignificant erosion of shareholder value and\nhighlighted the need for greater assurance\nthat executive compensation is principally\nperformance-based, fair, reasonable, and not\ndesigned in a manner that would incentivize\nexcessive risk-taking by\nmanagements. The financial crisis raised\nquestions about the role of pay incentives in\ninfluencing executive behavior and motivating\ninappropriate or excessive risk-taking that\ncould threaten a corporation\u0091s long-term\nviability. The safety\nlapses that led to the disastrous explosions\nat BP\u0092s Deepwater Horizon oil rig and Massey\nEnergy\u0092s Upper Big Branch mine, and the\nresulting unprecedented losses in shareholder\nvalue; a) underscore the importance of\nincorporating meaningful\neconomic incentives around social and\nenvironmental considerations in compensation\nprogram design, and b) exemplify the costly\nliabilities of failing to do so.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    36\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nEvolving disclosure requirements have opened a\nwider window\ninto compensation practices and processes,\ngiving shareholders more opportunity and\nresponsibility to ensure that pay is designed\nto create and sustain value. Companies in the\nU.S. are now required to evaluate and discuss\npotential risks arising\nfrom misguided or misaligned compensation\nprograms. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform\nand Consumer Protection Act requires advisory\nshareholder votes on executive compensation\n(management \u0093say on pay\u0094), an advisory vote on\nthe frequency of\nsay on pay, as well as a shareholder advisory\nvote on golden parachute compensation. The\nadvent of \u0093say on pay\u0094 votes for shareholders\nin the U.S. has provided a new communication\nmechanism and impetus for constructive\nengagement between\nshareholders and managers/directors on pay\nissues.\n\nThe socially responsible investing community\ncontends that corporations should be held\naccountable for their\nactions and decisions, including those around\nexecutive compensation. Social Advisory\nServices believes that executive pay programs\nshould be fair, competitive, reasonable, and\ncreate appropriate incentives, and that pay\nfor performance should be a\ncentral tenet in executive compensation\nphilosophy. Most investors expect corporations\nto adhere to certain best practice pay\nconsiderations in designing and administering\nexecutive and director compensation programs,\nincluding:\n                                              \n       Appropriate pay-for-performance        \n       alignment with emphasis on long-term   \n       shareholder value: executive pay       \n       practices must be designed to          \n       attract, retain, and appropriately     \n       motivate the key employees who drive   \n       shareholder value creation over the    \n       long term.

Granting stock options   \n       and restricted stock to executives     \n       that vest in five years do not         \n       necessarily provide a long-term        \n       focus, as executives can sell the      \n       company shares once they vest.         \n       However, requiring senior executives   \n       to hold company stock until they       \n       retire can encourage a long-term       \n       focus on company performance.          \n                                              \nCriteria for Evaluating Executive Pay\n\nPay-for-PerformanceEvaluation\n\nSocial Advisory Services conducts a five-part\npay analysis to evaluate the degree of\nalignment between the CEO\u0092s pay with the\ncompany\u0092s performance over a\nsustained period. From a shareholders\u0092\nperspective, performance is predominantly\ngauged by the company\u0092s stock performance over\ntime. Even when financial, non-financial or\noperational measures are\nutilized in incentive awards, the achievement\nrelated to these measures should ultimately\ntranslate into superior shareholder returns in\nthe long-term.

This non-binding\nshareholder vote on\ncompensation must be included in a proxy or\nconsent or authorization at least once every\nthree years.\n\nIn general, the SOP ballot item is the primary\nfocus of\nvoting on executive pay practices \u0096\ndissatisfaction with compensation practices\ncan be expressed by voting against the SOP\nproposal rather than voting against or\nwithhold from the compensation committee.\nHowever, if there is no SOP on the\nballot, then the negative vote will apply to\nmembers of the compensation committee. In\naddition, in egregious cases, or if the board\nfails to respond to concerns raised by a prior\nSOP proposal, then Social Advisory Services\nwill recommend a vote\nagainst or withhold votes from compensation\ncommittee members (or, if the full board is\ndeemed accountable, all directors). If the\nnegative factors involve equity-based\ncompensation, then a vote against an equity-\nbased plan proposal presented for\nshareholder approval may be appropriate. In\nevaluating SOP proposals, Social Advisory\nServices will also assess to what degree\nsocial and environmental considerations are\nincorporated into compensation programs and\nexecutive pay decision-making\n\u0096 to the extent that proxy statement\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A)\ndisclosures permit.\n\nSocial Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Evaluate executive pay and\npractices, as well as certain aspects of\noutside director compensation on a case-by-\ncasebasis.\n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote against management Say on Pay     \n       proposals if:                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       There is a misalignment between CEO    \n  \u220e    pay and company performance            \n       (pay-for-performance);

The SOP is at\nits essence a communication vehicle, and\ncommunication is most useful when it is\nreceived in a consistent and timely manner.\nSocial Advisory Services supports an annual\nSOP vote for many of the same\nreasons it supports annual director elections\nrather than a classified board structure:\nbecause this provides the highest level of\naccountability and direct communication by\nenabling the MSOP vote to correspond to the\nmajority of the information\npresented in the accompanying proxy statement\nfor the applicable shareholders\u0092 meeting.\nHaving SOP votes every two or three years,\ncovering all actions occurring between the\nvotes, would make it difficult to create the\nmeaningful and coherent\ncommunication that the votes are intended to\nprovide. Under triennial elections, for\nexample, a company would not know whether the\nshareholder vote references the compensation\nyear being discussed or a previous year,\nmaking it more difficult to\nunderstand the implications of the vote.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor annual advisory votes on compensation,\nwhich provide the most consistent and clear\ncommunication channel for shareholder concerns\nabout companies\u0092 executive pay programs.\n\nAdvisory Vote on Golden Parachutes in an\nAcquisition, Merger, Consolidation, or\nProposed Sale\n\nThis is a proxy item regarding specific\nadvisory votes on \u0093golden parachute\u0094\narrangements for Named Executive Officers\n(NEOs) that is required under The\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act.

However, the\npresence of multiple legacy problematic\nfeatures will also be closely scrutinized.\n\nIn cases where the golden parachute vote is\nincorporated into a company\u0092s\nadvisory vote on compensation (\u0093management\n\u0093say on pay\u0094), Social Advisory Services will\nevaluate the \u0093say on pay\u0094 proposal in\naccordance with these guidelines, which may\ngive higher weight to that component of the\noverall\nevaluation.\n\nEquity-Based Incentive Plans\n\nAs executive pay levels continue to soar, non-\nsalary compensation remains one of the most\nsensitive and visible corporate\ngovernance issues. The financial crisis raised\nquestions about the role of pay incentives in\ninfluencing executive behavior, including\ntheir appetite for risk-taking. Although\nshareholders may have little say about how\nmuch the CEO is paid in salary\nand bonus, they do have a major voice in\napproving stock incentive plans.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    42\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nStock-based plans can transfer significant\namounts of wealth\nfrom shareholders to executives and directors\nand are among the most economically\nsignificant issues that shareholders are\nentitled to vote on. Rightly, the cost of\nthese plans must be in line with the\nanticipated benefits to shareholders. Clearly,\nreasonable limits must be set on dilution as\nwell as administrative authority. In addition,\nshareholders must consider the necessity of\nthe various pay programs and examine the\nappropriateness of award types. Consequently,\nthe pros and cons of these\nproposals necessitate a case-by-case\nevaluation.\n\nFactors that increase the cost\n(or have the potential to increase the cost)\nof plans to shareholders include: excessive\ndilution, options awarded at below-market\ndiscounts, permissive policies on pyramiding,\nrestricted stock giveaways that reward tenure\nrather than results, sales\nof shares on concessionary terms, blank-check\nauthority for administering committees, option\nrepricing or option replacements, accelerated\nvesting of awards in the event of defined\nchanges in corporate control, stand-alone\nstock appreciation rights,\nloans or other forms of assistance, or\nevidence of improvident award policies.\n\nPositive plan features that can offset costly\nfeatures include: plans with modest\ndilution potential (i.e. appreciably below\ndouble-digit levels), bars to pyramiding and\nrelated safeguards for investor interests.\nAlso favorable are performance programs with a\nduration of two or more years, bonus schemes\nthat pay off in non-dilutive, fully deductible\ncash, 401K and other thrift or profit sharing\nplans, and tax-favored employee stock purchase\nplans. In general, we believe that stock plans\nshould afford incentives, not sure-fire, risk-\nfree rewards.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon equity-based compensation\nplans20 depending on a combination of certain\nplan features and equity grant practices,\nwhere positive factors may counterbalance\nnegative factors, and vice versa, as evaluated\nusing an\n\u0093equity plan scorecard\u0094 (EPSC) approach with\nthree pillars:\n                                              \n       Plan Cost: The total estimated cost    \n       of the company\u0092s equity plans relative  \n       to industry/market cap peers,          \n  \u220e    measured by the company\u0092s estimated     \n       Shareholder Value Transfer (SVT) in    \n       relation to peers and considering      \n       both:                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       SVT based on new shares requested      \n       plus shares remaining for future       \n  \u220e    grants, plus outstanding               \n       unvested/unexercised grants;

SVT is\nexpressed as both a dollar amount and as a\npercentage of market value, and includes the\nnew shares proposed, shares available under\nexisting plans, and shares\ngranted but unexercised (using two measures,\nin the case of plans subject to the Equity\nPlan Scorecard evaluation, as noted above).\nAll award types are valued. For omnibus plans,\nunless limitations are placed on the most\nexpensive types of awards\n(for example, full value awards), the\nassumption is made that all awards to be\ngranted will be the most expensive types. See\ndiscussion of specific types of awards.\n\nExcept for proposals subject to Equity Plan\nScorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value\nTransfer is reasonable if it falls below a\ncompany-specific benchmark. The\nbenchmark is determined as follows: The top\nquartile performers in each industry group\n(using the Global Industry Classification\nStandard: GICS) are identified.

Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\nbenchmarks will be calculated as the greater\nof: (1) an industry-specific threshold based\non three-year burn rates within the company\u0092s\nGICS group segmented by S&P 500, Russell 3000\nindex (less the S&P 500) and non-Russell 3000\nindex; and (2) a de minimis threshold\nestablished separately for each of the S&P\n500, the Russell\n3000 index less the S&P 500, and the non-\nRussell 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate\nbenchmark changes will be limited to a\npredetermined range above or below the prior\nyear\u0092s burn-rate benchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate will be\ncalculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn Rate = ((# of options *\noption\u0092s dollar value using a Black-Scholes\nmodel) + (# of full-value awards * stock\nprice)) / (Weighted\naverage common shares * stock price).\n\nLiberal Definition of Change-in-Control\n\nGenerally vote against equity plans if the\nplan\nprovides for the acceleration of vesting of\nequity awards even though an actual change in\ncontrol may not occur. Examples of such a\ndefinition could include, but are not limited\nto, announcement or commencement of a tender\noffer, provisions for\nacceleration upon a \u0093potential\u0094 takeover,\nshareholder approval of a merger or other\ntransactions, or similar language.\n\nOther Compensation Plans\n\nAmending Cash and Equity Plans (including\nApproval for Tax Deductibility (162(m))\n\nCash bonus plans can be an important part of\nan executive\u0092s overall pay package, along with\nstock-based plans tied to long-term total\nshareholder returns. Over\nthe long term, stock prices are an excellent\nindicator of management performance. However,\nother factors, such as economic conditions and\ninvestor reaction to the stock market in\ngeneral and certain industries in particular,\ncan greatly impact the\ncompany\u0092s stock price. As a result, a cash\nbonus plan can effectively reward individual\nperformance and the achievement of business\nunit objectives that are independent of short-\nterm market share price fluctuations.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon amendments to cash and equity\nincentive plans.\n\nGenerally vote\nfor proposals to amend executive cash, stock,\nor cash and stock incentive plans if the\nproposal:\n                                              \n  \u220e    Addresses administrative features      \n       only; or                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Seeks approval for Section\u00a0162(m)      \n       purposes only, and the plan            \n       administering committee consists       \n       entirely of                            \n       independent directors, per Social      \n  \u220e    Advisory Services\u0092 Categorization of    \n       Directors.

From a\nshareholder\u0092s perspective, plans with offering\nperiods of 27 months or less are preferable.\nPlans with longer offering periods remove too\nmuch of the market\nrisk and could give participants excessive\ndiscounts on their stock purchases that are\nnot offered to other shareholders.\n\nQualified Plans\n\nQualified employee stock purchase plans\nqualify for favorable tax treatment under\nSection 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such\nplans must\nbe broad-based, permitting all full-time\nemployees to participate. Some companies also\npermit part-time staff to participate.\nQualified ESPPs must be expensed under SFAS\n123 unless the plan meets the following\nconditions; a) purchase discount is\n5 percent or below; b) all employees can\nparticipate in the program; and 3) no look-\nback feature in the program.

In addition, an ESOP must\nbe created for the benefit of non-management\nlevel employees and\nadministered by a trust that cannot\ndiscriminate in favor of highly paid\npersonnel.\n\nAcademic research of the performance of ESOPs\nin closely held companies found\nthat ESOPs appear to increase overall sales,\nemployment, and sales per employee over what\nwould have been expected absent an ESOP.\nStudies have also found that companies with an\nESOP are also more likely to still be in\nbusiness several years later,\nand are more likely to have other retirement\noriented benefit plans than comparable non-\nESOP companies.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor proposals to implement an ESOP or increase\nauthorized shares for existing ESOPs, unless\nthe number of shares allocated to the ESOP is\nexcessive (more than five percent of\noutstanding shares).\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    47\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nOption Exchange Programs/Repricing Options\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon management proposals seeking\napproval to exchange/reprice options taking\ninto consideration:\n                                              \n       Historic trading patterns \u0096 the stock   \n  \u220e    price should not be so volatile that   \n       the options are likely to be back      \n       \u0093in-the-money\u0094 over the near term;       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Rationale for the re-pricing \u0096 was the  \n  \u220e    stock price decline beyond             \n       management\u0092s control?                   \n                                              \n                                            \n  \u220e    Is this a value-for-value exchange?  \n                                            \n                                              \n  \u220e    Are surrendered stock options added    \n       back to the plan reserve?              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Option vesting \u0096 does the new option    \n  \u220e    vest immediately or is there a         \n       black-out period?                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Term of the option \u0096 the term should    \n  \u220e    remain the same as that of the         \n       replaced option;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Exercise price \u0096 should be set at fair  \n       market or a premium to market;         \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Participants \u0096 executive officers and   \n       directors should be excluded.          \n                                              \nIf the surrendered options are added back to\nthe equity plans for re-issuance, then also\ntake into consideration the\ncompany\u0092s total cost of equity plans and its\nthree-year average burn rate.\n\nIn addition to the above considerations,\nevaluate the intent, rationale, and\ntiming of the repricing proposal. The proposal\nshould clearly articulate why the board is\nchoosing to conduct an exchange program at\nthis point in time. Repricing underwater\noptions after a recent precipitous drop in the\ncompany\u0092s stock price\ndemonstrates poor timing. Repricing after a\nrecent decline in stock price triggers\nadditional scrutiny and a potential vote\nagainst the proposal. At a minimum, the\ndecline should not have happened within the\npast year. Also, consider the terms of\nthe surrendered options, such as the grant\ndate, exercise price and vesting schedule.\nGrant dates of surrendered options should be\nfar enough back (two to three years) so as not\nto suggest that repricings are being done to\ntake advantage of\nshort-term downward price movements.\nSimilarly, the exercise price of surrendered\noptions should be above the 52-week high for\nthe stock price.\n\nVote for shareholder proposals to put option\nrepricings to a shareholder vote.\n\nStock Plans in Lieu of Cash\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on plans that        \n       provide participants with the option   \n  \u220e    of taking all or a portion of their    \n       cash compensation in the form of       \n       stock.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for non-employee director-only    \n  \u220e    equity plans that provide a            \n       dollar-for-dollar cash-for-stock       \n       exchange.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on plans which do    \n       not provide a                          \n       dollar-for-dollar cash for stock       \n       exchange.

A\n401(k) plan is any qualified plan under\nSection 401(k) of the Internal\nRevenue Code that contains a cash or deferred\narrangement. In its simplest form, an employee\ncan elect to have a portion of his salary\ninvested in a 401(k) plan before any income\ntaxes are assessed. The money can only be\nwithdrawn before retirement\nunder penalty. However, because the money\ncontributed to the plan is withdrawn before\ntaxes (reducing the employee\u0092s income tax), a\nproperly planned 401(k) plan will enable an\nemployee to make larger contributions to a\n401(k) plan than to a\nsavings plan, and still take the same amount\nhome.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor proposals to implement a 401(k) savings\nplan for employees.\n\nSeverance Agreements for Executives/Golden\nParachutes\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\non a case-by-casebasis on proposals to ratify\nor cancel golden parachutes.

Directors themselves oversee the\nprocess for evaluating board performance and\nestablishing pay packages for board members.\n\nShareholders provide\nlimited oversight of directors by electing\nindividuals who are primarily selected by the\nboard, or a board nominating committee, and by\nvoting on stock-based plans for directors\ndesigned by the board compensation committee.\nAdditionally,\nshareholders may submit and vote on their own\nresolutions seeking to limit or restructure\ndirector pay. While the cost of compensating\nnon-employee directors is small in absolute\nterms, compared to the cost of\ncompensating executives, it is still a\ncritical aspect of a company\u0092s overall\ncorporate governance structure.\n\nOverall, director pay levels are rising in\npart because of the new forms of pay in use at\nmany companies, as well as because of the\nincreased responsibilities arising from the\n2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. In\naddition to an annual retainer fee, many\ncompanies also pay fees for\nattending board and committee meetings, fees\nfor chairing a committee, or a retainer fee\nfor chairing a committee.\n\nDirector compensation packages should be\ndesigned to provide value to directors for\ntheir contribution. Given that many directors\nare high-level executives whose personal\nincome levels are generally high, cash\ncompensation may hold little appeal. Stock-\nbased incentives on the other hand\nreinforce the directors\u0092 role of protecting\nand enhancing shareholder value. The stock-\nbased component of director compensation\nshould be large enough to ensure that when\nfaced with a situation in which the interests\nof shareholders and\nmanagement differ, the board will have a\nfinancial incentive to think as a shareholder.\nAdditionally, many companies have instituted\nequity ownership programs for directors.\nSocial Advisory Services recommends that\ndirectors receive stock grants\nequal to three times of their annual retainer,\nas it is a reasonable starting point for\ncompanies of all sizes and industries. A\nvesting schedule for director grants helps\ndirectors to meet the stock ownership\nguidelines and maintains their\nlong-term interests in the firm.\n\nDirector compensation packages should also be\ndesigned to attract and retain competent\ndirectors who are willing to risk\nbecoming a defendant in a lawsuit and suffer\npotentially adverse publicity if the company\nruns into financial difficulties or is\nmismanaged.\n\nShareholder Ratification of Director Pay\nPrograms\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\ncase-by-caseon management proposals seeking\nratification of non-employeedirector\ncompensation, based on the following factors:\n                                              \n       If the equity plan under which         \n       non-employee director grants are made  \n  \u220e    is on the                              \n       ballot, whether or not it warrants     \n       support;

Companies\nalso disclose their compensation practices and\ndetails of their stock-based compensation\nplans. While this level of disclosure is\nhelpful, it does not always provide a\ncomprehensive picture of the company\u0092s\ncompensation practices. For\nshareholders to make informed decisions on\ncompensation levels, they need to have clear,\nconcise information at their disposal.\nIncreased disclosure will help ensure that\nmanagement: (1) has legitimate reasons for\nsetting specific pay levels;\nand (2) is held accountable for its actions.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals seeking increased\ndisclosure on executive compensation issues\nincluding the preparation of a formal report\non executive compensation practices and\npolicies.\n\nLimit Executive Compensation\n\nProposals\nthat seek to limit executive or director\ncompensation usually focus on the absolute\ndollar figure of the compensation or focus on\nthe ratio of compensation between the\nexecutives and the average worker of a\nspecific company. Proponents argue that\nthe exponential growth of executive salaries\nis not in the best interests of shareholders,\nespecially when that pay is exorbitant when\ncompared to the compensation of other workers.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for proposals to prepare reports  \n       seeking to compare the wages of a      \n  \u220e    company\u0092s lowest paid worker to the     \n       highest                                \n       paid workers.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on proposals that    \n       seek                                   \n  \u220e    to establish a fixed ratio between     \n       the company\u0092s lowest paid workers and   \n       the highest paid workers.              \n                                              \nStock Ownership Requirements\n\nCorporate directors should own some amount of\nstock of the companies on which they serve as\nboard members. Stock ownership is a\nsimple method to align the interests of\ndirectors with company shareholders.\nNevertheless, many highly qualified\nindividuals such as academics and clergy who\ncan offer valuable perspectives in boardrooms\nmay be unable to purchase individual shares\nof stock. In such a circumstance, the\npreferred solution is to look at the board\nnominees individually and take stock ownership\ninto consideration when voting on the merits\nof each candidate.\n\nSocial Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote against\nshareholder proposals that mandate a minimum\namount of stock that directors must own in\norder to qualify as a director or to remain on\nthe board.\n\nProhibit/Require Shareholder Approval for\nOption Repricing\n\nRepricing involves the reduction of the\noriginal exercise price of a\nstock option after the fall in share price.\nSocial Advisory Services does not support\nrepricing since it undermines the incentive\npurpose of the plan. The use of options as an\nincentive means that employees must bear the\nsame risks as shareholders\nin holding these options. Shareholder\nresolutions calling on companies to abandon\nthe practice of repricing or to submit\nrepricings to a shareholder vote will be\nsupported.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking to limit repricing.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n  \u220e    the company to have option repricings  \n       submitted for shareholder              \n       ratification.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    52\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nSeverance Agreements/Golden Parachutes\n\nGolden parachutes are designed to protect the\nemployees of a corporation in the event of a\nchange in control.

Because\nemployer contributions to these plans are\ncredited evenly over the life of a plan, and\nnot based on a seniority formula they may\nreduce payouts to long-term employees who are\ncurrently vested in plans.\n\nCash-balance pension conversions have\nundergone congressional and federal agency\nscrutiny following high-profile EEOC\ncomplaints on age discrimination and\nemployee anger at companies like IBM. While\nsignificant change is unlikely in the short-\ntm, business interests were concerned enough\nthat the National Association of Manufacturers\nand other business lobbies\nformed a Capitol Hill coalition to preserve\nthe essential features of the plans and to\noverturn an IRS ruling. Driving the push\nbehind conversions from traditional pension\nplans to cash-balance plans are the\nsubstantial savings that companies\ngenerate in the process.

Mergers and Corporate Restructurings  \n                                              \nA merger occurs when one corporation is\nabsorbed into another and ceases to exist. The\nsurviving company gains all the rights,\nprivileges, powers, duties, obligations and\nliabilities of the merged corporation. The\nshareholders of the absorbed company receive\nstock or securities of the\nsurviving company or other consideration as\nprovided by the plan of merger. Mergers,\nconsolidations, share exchanges, and sale of\nassets are friendly in nature, which is to say\nthat both sides have agreed to the combination\nor acquisition of assets.\n\nShareholder approval for an acquiring company\nis generally not required under state law or\nstock exchange regulations unless the\nacquisition is in the form of a\nstock transaction which would result in the\nissue of 20 percent or more of the acquirer\u0092s\noutstanding shares or voting power, or unless\nthe two entities involved require that\nshareholders approve the deal. Under most\nstate laws, however, a\ntarget company must submit merger agreements\nto a shareholder vote. Shareholder approval is\nrequired in the formation of a consolidated\ncorporation.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nM&A analyses are inherently a balance of\ncompeting factors. Bright line rules are\ndifficult if not\nimpossible to apply to a world where every\ndeal is different. Ultimately, the question\nfor shareholders (both of the acquirer and the\ntarget) is the following: Is the valuation\nfair? Shareholders of the acquirer may be\nconcerned that the deal values\nthe target too highly. Shareholders of the\ntarget may be concerned that the deal\nundervalues their interests.\n\nVote recommendation will be based on primarily\nan\nanalysis of shareholder value, which itself\ncan be affected by ancillary factors such as\nthe negotiation process. The importance of\nother factors, including corporate governance\nand social and environmental considerations\nhowever, should not fail to\nbe recognized.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Votes\non mergers and acquisitions are considered on\na case-by-casebasis. A review and evaluation\nof the merits and drawbacks of the proposed\ntransaction is conducted, balancing various\nand sometimes countervailing factors\nincluding:\n                                              \n       Valuation: Is the value to be          \n       received by the target shareholders    \n       (or paid by the acquirer) reasonable?  \n       While the fairness opinion may         \n  \u220e    provide an initial starting point for  \n       assessing valuation reasonableness,    \n       emphasis is placed on the offer        \n       premium, market reaction and           \n       strategic rationale;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Market reaction: How has the market    \n  \u220e    responded to the proposed deal?

In order to be able to\nintelligently monitor their investments\nshareholders often need information best\nprovided by the company in which they have\ninvested. Requests to report such information\nwill merit support. Requests to establish\nspecial committees of the board to address\nbroad corporate policy and provide forums for\nongoing dialogue on issues including, but not\nlimited to shareholder relations, the\nenvironment, human rights, occupational health\nand safety, and executive\ncompensation, will generally be supported,\nparticularly when they appear to offer a\npotentially effective method for enhancing\nshareholder value. We will closely evaluate\nproposals that ask the company to cease\ncertain actions that the proponent\nbelieves are harmful to society or some\nsegment of society with special attention to\nthe company\u0092s legal and ethical obligations,\nits ability to remain profitable, and\npotential negative publicity if the company\nfails to honor the request.\nSocial Advisory Services supports shareholder\nproposals that improve the company\u0092s public\nimage, and reduce exposure to liabilities.\n\nDiversity and Equality\n\nDiversity and Equality\n\nSignificant progress\nhas been made in recent years in the\nadvancement of gender and racial diversity in\nthe workplace and the establishment of greater\nprotections against discriminatory practices\nin the workplace. In the U.S, there are many\ncivil rights laws that are\nenforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission. The Civil Rights Act of 1964\nprohibits discrimination based on race\nreligion, sex, gender identity, sexual\norientation, and nationality. However,\ndiscrimination on the basis of federally\nprotected characteristics continues. The SEC\u0092s\nrevised disclosure rules now require\ninformation on how boards factor diversity\ninto the director nomination process, as well\nas disclosure on how the board assesses the\neffectiveness of its\ndiversity policy.\n\nShareholder proposals on diversity may target\na company\u0092s board nomination procedures or\nseek greater disclosure on a company\u0092s\nprograms and procedures on increasing the\ndiversity of its workforce, and make reference\nto one or more of the following points:\n                                              \n       Violations of workplace                \n       anti-discrimination laws lead to       \n  \u220e    expensive litigation and damaged       \n       corporate reputations that are         \n       not in the best interests of           \n       shareholders;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    62\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Employers already prepare employee     \n       diversity reports for the EEOC, so     \n  \u220e    preparing a similar report to          \n       shareholders can be                    \n       done at minimal cost;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The presence of gender and ethnic      \n       diversity in workforce and customer    \n       pools gives companies with             \n  \u220e    diversified boards a                   \n       practical advantage over their         \n       competitors as a result of their       \n       unique perspectives;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Efforts to increase diversity on       \n  \u220e    corporate boards can be made at        \n       reasonable costs;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Reports can be prepared \u0093at reasonable  \n       expense\u0094 describing efforts to          \n  \u220e    encourage diversified representation   \n       on                                     \n       their boards;                          \n                                              \nAdd Women and Minorities to the Board\n\nBoard diversification proposals ask companies\nto put systems in place to increase the\nrepresentation of gender, ethnic, and racial\ndiversity as well as union members\nor other underrepresented minority groups on\nboards of directors.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that    \n  \u220e    ask the company to take steps to       \n       increase diversity to the board.       \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n       for reports on board diversity.        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n       companies to adopt nomination          \n  \u220e    charters or amend existing charters    \n       to include                             \n       reasonable language addressing         \n       diversity.                             \n                                              \nRacial Equity and/or Civil Rights Audits\n\nSocial Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote for proposals\nrequesting that a company conduct an\nindependent racial equity and/or civil rights\naudit, considering company disclosures,\npolicies, actions, and engagements.\n\nReport on the Distribution of Stock Options by\nGender and Race\n\nCompanies have received requests from\nshareholders to prepare reports documenting\nthe distribution of the stock options and\nrestricted stock awards by race and gender\nof the recipient. Proponents of these\nproposals argue that, in the future, there\nwill be a shift toward basing racial and\ngender discrimination suits on the\ndistribution of corporate wealth through stock\noptions. The appearance of these proposals is\nalso in response to the nationwide wage gap\nand under representation of minorities and\nwomen at the highest levels of compensation.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals asking companies to\nreport on the distribution of stock options by\nrace and gender of the recipient.\n\nPrepare Report/Promote EEOC-Related Activities\n\nFilers of proposals on this issue generally\nask a company to make available, at a\nreasonable cost and omitting proprietary\ninformation, data the company includes in\nits annual report to the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) outlining the\nmake-up of its workforce by race, gender and\nposition. Shareholders also ask companies to\nreport on any efforts they are\nmaking to advance the representation of\nunderrepresented gender, ethnic, and racial\nidentities in their workforce. The costs of\nviolating federal laws that prohibit\ndiscrimination by corporations are high and\ncan affect corporate earnings. The Equal\nOpportunities Employment Commission does not\nrelease the companies\u0092 filings to the public,\nunless it is involved in litigation and this\ninformation is difficult to obtain from other\nsources.

In\ninstances where companies themselves operate\nfactories in developing countries for example,\nthese advocates have asked that the companies\nadopt global corporate standards that\nguarantee sustainable wages and safe working\nconditions for their workers\nabroad. Companies that contract out portions\nof their manufacturing operations to foreign\ncompanies have been asked to ensure that the\nproducts they receive from those contractors\nhave not been made using forced labor, child\nlabor, or other forms of\nmodern slavery. These companies are asked to\nadopt formal vendor standards that, among\nother things, include some sort of monitoring\nmechanisms. Globalization, relocation of\nproduction overseas, and widespread use of\nsubcontractors and vendors;\noften make it difficult to obtain a complete\npicture of a company\u0092s labor practices in\nglobal markets. Deadly accidents at factories,\nmost notably in Bangladesh and Pakistan, have\ncontinued to intensify these concerns. Many\ninvestors believe\nthat companies would benefit from adopting a\nhuman rights policy, based on the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the\nInternational Labour Organization\u0092s Core Labor\nStandards. Efforts that seek greater\ndisclosure on a company\u0092s\nglobal labor practices, including its supply\nchain, and that seek to establish minimum\nstandards for a company\u0092s operations will be\nsupported. In addition, requests for\nindependent monitoring of overseas operations\nwill be supported.\n\nSocial Advisory Services generally supports\nproposals that call for the adoption and/or\nenforcement of principles or codes relating to\ncountries in which there are\nsystematic violations of human rights; such as\nthe use of slave, child, or prison labor; a\ngovernment that is illegitimate; or there is a\ncall by human rights advocates, pro-democracy\norganizations, or\nlegitimately-elected representatives for\neconomic sanctions. The use of child labor or\nforced labor is unethical and can damage\ncorporate reputations. Poor labor practices\ncan lead to litigation against the company,\nwhich can be costly and time\nconsuming.\n\nCodes of Conduct and Vendor Standards\n\nShareholders have submitted proposals that\npertain to the adoption of codes of conduct or\nprovision, greater disclosure on a company\u0092s\ninternational workplace\nstandards, or that request human rights risk\nassessment. Companies have been asked to adopt\na number of different types of codes,\nincluding a workplace code of conduct,\nstandards for international business\noperations, human rights standards,\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO)\nstandards and the SA 8000 principles. The ILO\nis an independent agency of the United Nations\nwhich consists of 187 member nations\nrepresented by workers, employers, and\ngovernments. The ILO\u0092s general\nmandate is to promote a decent workplace for\nall individuals. The ILO sets international\nlabor standards in the form of its conventions\nand then monitors compliance with the\nstandards. The seven conventions of the ILO\nfall under four broad\ncategories: Right to organize and bargain\ncollectively, Nondiscrimination in employment,\nAbolition of forced labor, and End of child\nlabor. Each of the 187 member-nations of the\nILO is bound to respect and promote these\nrights to the best of their\nabilities. SA 8000 is a set of labor\nstandards, based on the principles of the ILO\nconventions and other human rights\nconventions, and covers eight workplace\nconditions, including: child labor, forced\nlabor, health and safety, freedom of\nassociation\nand the right to collective bargaining,\ndiscrimination, disciplinary practices,\nworking hours and compensation.

They request\ncompanies operating abroad to\nsupport the equal employment opportunity\npolicies that apply in facilities they operate\ndomestically. The principles were established\nto address the sectarian hiring problems\nbetween Protestants and Catholics in Northern\nIreland. It is well\ndocumented that Northern Ireland\u0092s Catholic\ncommunity faced much higher unemployment\nfigures than the Protestant community. In\nresponse to this problem, the U.K. government\ninstituted the New Fair Employment Act of 1989\n(and subsequent\namendments) to address the sectarian hiring\nproblems.\n\nMany companies believe that the Act adequately\naddresses the problems and that further\naction, including\nadoption of the MacBride Principles, only\nduplicates the efforts already underway. In\nevaluating a proposal to adopt the MacBride\nPrinciples, shareholders must decide whether\nthe principles will cause companies to divest,\nand therefore worsen the\nunemployment problem, or whether the\nprinciples will promote equal hiring\npractices. Proponents believe that the Fair\nEmployment Act does not sufficiently address\nthe sectarian hiring problems. They argue that\nthe MacBride Principles serve to\nstabilize the situation and promote further\ninvestment.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals to report on or\nimplement the MacBride Principles.\n\nCommunity Impact Assessment/Indigenous\nPeoples\u0092 Rights\n\nA number of U.S. public companies have found\ntheir operations or expansion plans in\nconflict with local\nindigenous groups. In order to improve their\nstanding with indigenous groups and decrease\nany negative publicity companies may face,\nsome concerned shareholders have sought\nreports requesting that companies review their\nobligations, actions and\npresence on these groups. Some companies have\nmade progress in working with indigenous\ngroups. However, shareholders who are\nconcerned with the negative impact that the\ncompany\u0092s operations may have on the\nindigenous people\u0092s land and\ncommunity, have sought reports detailing the\nimpact of the company\u0092s actions and presence\non these groups.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals asking to prepare\nreports on a company\u0092s environmental and\nhealth impact on communities.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    66\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nReport on Risks of Outsourcing\n\nConsumer interest in keeping costs low through\ncomparison shopping, coupled with\nbreakthroughs in productivity have prompted\ncompanies to look for\nmethods of increasing profit margins while\nkeeping prices competitive. Through a practice\nknown as off-shoring, the outsourcing or\nmoving of manufacturing and service operations\nto foreign markets with lower\nlabor costs, companies have found one method\nwhere the perceived savings potential is quite\nsubstantial. Shareholder opponents of\noutsourcing argue that there may be long-term\nconsequences to offshore outsourcing that\noutweigh short-term benefits\nsuch as backlash from a public already\nsensitive to off-shoring, security risks from\ninformation technology development overseas,\nand diminished employee morale. Shareholder\nproposals addressing outsourcing\nask that companies prepare a report to\nshareholders evaluating the risk to the\ncompany\u0092s brand name and reputation in the\nU.S. from outsourcing and off-shoring of\nmanufacturing and service work to other\ncountries.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholders proposals asking companies to\nreport on the risks associated with\noutsourcing or off-shoring.\n\nReport on the Impact of Health Pandemics on\nCompany Operations\n\nFollowing the COVID-19\npandemic, among other historic pandemics, the\ndistribution of treatments vastly differed in\neffectiveness between regions. With limited\naccess to adequate treatments, the increasing\ndeath toll is expected to have profound\nsocial, political, and\neconomic impact globally, including on the\ncompanies or industries with operations in\naffected areas. In the past, shareholder\nproposals asked companies to develop policies\nto provide affordable drugs in historically\ndisadvantaged regions. However,\nin recent years, shareholders have changed\ntheir tactic, asking instead for reports on\nthe impact of these pandemics on company\noperations, including both pharmaceutical and\nnon-pharmaceutical companies\noperating in high-risk areas. This change is\nconsistent with the general shift in\nshareholder proposals towards risk assessment\nand mitigation.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals asking for companies\nto report on the impact of pandemics, such as\nCOVID-19,HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis,\non their business strategies.\n\nMandatory Arbitration\n\nSocial Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote for requests for\na report on a company\u0092s use of mandatory\narbitration on employment-related claims.\n\nSexual Harassment\n\nSocial Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Generally vote for requests for\na report on company actions taken to\nstrengthen policies and oversight to prevent\nworkplace sexual harassment, or a report on\nrisks posed by a company\u0092s failure to prevent\nworkplace sexual harassment.\n                                              \n   Operations in High-Risk Markets            \n                                              \nIn recent\nyears, shareholder advocates and human rights\norganizations have highlighted concerns\nassociated with companies operating in regions\nthat are politically unstable, including state\nsponsors of terror. The U.S. government has\nactive trade sanction\nregimes in place against specific companies,\nor persons, including Russia, China, Cuba,\nIran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, among\nothers. These sanctions are enforced by the\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control, which is\npart of the U.S. Department of\nthe Treasury, as well as U.S. Customs and\nBorder Patrol for sanctioned goods. However,\nthese countries do not comprise an exhaustive\nlist of countries considered to be high-risk\nmarkets.\n\nShareholder proponents have filed resolutions\naddressing a variety of concerns around how\ninvestments and operations in high-risk\nregions may support, or be perceived\nto support, potentially oppressive\ngovernments.

In addition, a\nnumber of Chinese companies have been\nconnected to the use of state-sponsored labor\nof Uyghur and other Muslim minority groups.\nThe Chinese government has explained these\nforced labor transfer\nprograms as policies to combat terrorism,\nreligious extremism, and poverty in the\nXinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n  \u220e    requesting more disclosure on a        \n       company\u0092s involvement in China          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on shareholder       \n  \u220e    proposals that ask a company to        \n       terminate a project or investment in   \n       China.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    68\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nProduct Sales to Repressive Regimes\n\nCertain Internet technology companies have\nbeen accused of assisting repressive\ngovernments in violating human rights through\nthe knowing misuse of\ntheir hardware and software.

Shareholder proposals,\nsubmitted at various companies, advocated for\ncompanies to take steps to stop abetting\nrepression and censorship of the\nInternet and/or review their human rights\npolicies taking this issue into consideration.\nResolution sponsors generally argue that the\nChinese government is using IT company\ntechnologies to track, monitor, identify, and,\nultimately, suppress\npolitical dissent. In the view of proponents,\nthis process of surveillance and associated\nsuppression violates internationally accepted\nnorms outlined in the U.N. Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\n\nWhile early shareholder resolutions on\nInternet issues focused on censorship by\nrepressive regimes and net neutrality,\nproponents have recently raised concerns\nregarding privacy and data security in the\nwake of increased breaches that result in the\nmisuse of personal information. On Oct. 13,\n2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) issued a guidance document about the\ndisclosure obligations\nrelating to cybersecurity risks and cyber\nincidents. In the document, the SEC references\nthe negative consequences that are associated\nwith cyber-attacks, such as: remediation\ncosts, including those required to repair\nrelationships with customers\nand clients; increased cyber-security\nprotection costs; lost revenues from\nunauthorized use of the information or missed\nopportunities to attract clients; litigation;\nand reputational damage. The document says\nthat while the federal securities laws\ndo not explicitly require disclosure of\ncybersecurity risks and incidents, some\ndisclosure requirements may impose an\nobligation on the company to disclose such\ninformation and provides scenarios where\ndisclosure may be required. According to the\nFBI\u0092s 2021 Internet Crime report, potential\nlosses from cybercrimes hit $6.9 billion, up\n64% from 2018.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor resolutions requesting the disclosure and\nimplementation of Internet privacy and\ncensorship policies and procedures\nconsidering:\n                                              \n       The level of disclosure of policies    \n       and procedures relating to privacy,    \n  \u220e    freedom of speech, Internet            \n       censorship, and                        \n       government monitoring of the           \n       Internet;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Engagement in dialogue with            \n       governments and/or relevant groups     \n  \u220e    with respect to the Internet and the   \n       free flow of                           \n       information;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       The scope of business involvement and  \n       of investment in markets that          \n  \u220e    maintain government censorship or      \n       monitoring of the                      \n       Internet;                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       The market-specific laws or            \n       regulations applicable to Internet     \n  \u220e    censorship or monitoring that may be   \n       imposed on the                         \n       company; and                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       The level of controversy or            \n  \u220e    litigation related to the company\u0092s     \n       international human rights policies    \n       and procedures.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    69\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nDisclosure on Plant Closings\n\nShareholders have asked that companies\ncontemplating plant closures consider the\nimpact of such closings on employees and the\ncommunity, especially\nwhen such plan closures involve a community\u0092s\nlargest employers.

Scientists generally agree that gases\nreleased by chemical reactions including the\nburning of fossil fuels contribute to a\n\u0093greenhouse effect\u0094 that traps the planet\u0092s\nheat. Environmentalists claim that the\nGreenhouse Gases(GHG) produced by the\nindustrial age have caused\nrecent weather crises such as heat waves,\nrainstorms, melting glaciers, rising sea\nlevels and receding coastlines. Climate change\nskeptics have described the rise and fall of\nglobal temperatures as naturally occurring\nphenomena and depicted human\nimpact on climate change as minimal.\nShareholder proposals requesting companies to\nissue a report to shareholders, \u0093at reasonable\ncost and omitting proprietary information,\u0094 on\ngreenhouse gas emissions ask that the report\ninclude\ndescriptions of corporate efforts to reduce\nemissions, companies\u0092 financial exposure and\npotential liability from operations that\ncontribute to global warming, their direct or\nindirect efforts to promote the view that\nglobal warming is not a\nthreat, and their goals in reducing these\nemissions from their operations. Shareholder\nproponents argue that there is scientific\nproof that the burning of fossil fuels causes\nglobal warming, that future legislation may\nmake companies financially\nliable for their contributions to global\nwarming, and that a report on the company\u0092s\nrole in global warming can be assembled at\nreasonable cost.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking information on the financial,  \n       physical, or regulatory risks it       \n  \u220e    faces related to                       \n       climate change- on its operations and  \n       investments, or on how the company     \n       identifies, measures, and manage such  \n       risks.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n  \u220e    calling for the reduction of GHG or    \n       adoption of GHG goals in products and  \n       operations.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking reports on responses to        \n       regulatory and public pressures        \n  \u220e    surrounding climate                    \n       change, and for disclosure of          \n       research that aided in setting         \n       company policies around climate        \n       change.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       requesting reports on greenhouse gas   \n  \u220e    emissions from companies\u0092 operations    \n       and/or                                 \n       products.                              \n                                              \nInvest in Clean/Renewable Energy\n\nFilers of proposals on renewable energy ask\ncompanies to increase their investment in\nrenewable energy sources and to work to\ndevelop products that rely more on\nrenewable energy sources. Increased use of\nrenewable energy will reduce the negative\nenvironmental impact of energy companies. In\naddition, as supplies of oil and coal exist in\nthe earth in limited quantities, renewable\nenergy sources represent a\ncompetitive, and some would argue essential,\nlong-term business strategy.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking the preparation of a report    \n  \u220e    on a company\u0092s activities related to    \n       the                                    \n       development of renewable energy        \n       sources.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking increased investment in        \n  \u220e    renewable energy sources unless the    \n       terms of the                           \n       resolution are overly restrictive.     \n                                              \nEnergy Efficiency\n\nReducing the negative impact to the\nenvironment can be done through the use of\nmore energy efficient practices and products.\nShareholders propose that corporations\nshould have energy efficient manufacturing\nprocesses and should market more energy\nefficient products. This can be done by\nutilizing renewable energy sources that are\ncost-competitive and by implementing energy\nefficient operations.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nforshareholder proposals requesting a report\non company energy efficiency policies and/or\ngoals.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    71\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nEnvironment\n\nProposals addressing environmental and energy\nconcerns are plentiful, and generally seek\ngreater disclosure on a particular issue or\nseek to improve a company\u0092s\nenvironmental practices in order to protect\nthe world\u0092s natural resources. In addition,\nsome proponents cite the negative financial\nimplications for companies with poor\nenvironmental practices, including liabilities\nassociated with site clean-ups and lawsuits,\nas well as arguments that energy efficient\nproducts and clean environmental practices are\nsustainable business practices that will\ncontribute to long-term shareholder value.\nShareholders\nproponents point out that the majority of\nindependent atmospheric scientists agree that\nglobal warming poses a serious problem to the\nhealth and welfare of our planet, citing the\nfindings of the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change. Shareholder\nactivists argue that companies can report on\ntheir greenhouse gas emissions within a few\nmonths at reasonable cost. The general trend\nindicates a movement towards encouraging\ncompanies to have proactive environmental\npolicies, focusing on maximizing\nthe efficient use of non-renewable resources\nand minimizing threats of harm to human health\nor the environment.\n\nEnvironmental/Sustainability Reports\n\nShareholders may request general environmental\ndisclosures or reports on a specific\nlocation/operation, often requesting that the\ncompany detail the environmental risks and\npotential liabilities of a specific project.\nIncreasingly, companies have begun reporting\non environmental and sustainability issues\nusing the Global Reporting\nInitiative (GRI) standards. The GRI was\nestablished in 1997 with the mission of\ndeveloping globally applicable guidelines for\nreporting on economic, environmental, and\nsocial performance. The GRI was developed by\nCeres(formerly known as the Coalition for\nEnvironmentally Responsible Economies, CERES)\nin partnership with the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP).\n\nCeres was formed in the wake of the March 1989\nExxon Valdez oil spill, when a consortium of\ninvestors, environmental groups, and\nreligious organizations drafted what were\noriginally named the Valdez Principles. Later\nto be renamed the CERES Principles, and now\nbranded as the Ceres Roadmap 2030, corporate\nsignatories to the Ceres Roadmap 2030 pledge\nto publicly report on\nenvironmental issues, including protection of\nthe biosphere, sustainable use of natural\nresources, reduction and disposal of wastes,\nenergy conservation, and employee and\ncommunity risk reduction in a standardized\nform.\n\nThe Equator Principles are the financial\nindustry\u0092s benchmark for determining,\nassessing and managing social and\nenvironmental risk in project financing. The\nPrinciples were first launched in June 2003\nand were ultimately adopted by over forty\nfinancial institutions during a three year\nimplementation period. The principles were\nsubsequently revised in July 2006 to take into\naccount the new performance\nstandards approved by the World Bank Group\u0092s\nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC). The\nthird iteration of the Principles was launched\nin June 2013 and it amplified the banks\u0092\ncommitments to social responsibility,\nincluding human rights,\nclimate change, and transparency. Financial\ninstitutions adopt these principles to ensure\nthat the projects they venture in are\ndeveloped in a socially responsible manner and\nreflect sound environmental management\npractices.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking greater disclosure on the      \n  \u220e    company\u0092s environmental and social      \n       practices, and/or associated risks     \n       and liabilities.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n  \u220e    companies to report in accordance      \n       with the Global Reporting Initiative   \n       (GRI).                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n  \u220e    seeking the preparation of             \n       sustainability reports.                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals to      \n  \u220e    study or implement the CERES Roadmap   \n       2030.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals to      \n  \u220e    study or implement the Equator         \n       Principles.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    72\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n   Operations in Environmentally              \n   Sensitive Areas                            \n                                              \nCanadian Oil Sands\n\nProposals asking for a report on oil sands\noperations in the Athabasca region of Alberta,\nCanada have appeared at a number of oil and\ngas companies. Alberta\u0092s\noil sands contain a reserve largely thought to\nbe one of the world\u0092s largest potential energy\nsources. Rising oil sands production in\nAlberta has been paralleled with concerns from\na variety of stakeholders\u0097including\nenvironmental groups,\nlocal residents, and shareholders\u0097regarding\nthe environmental impacts of the complicated\nextraction and upgrading processes required to\nconvert oil sands into a synthetic crude oil.\nThe high viscosity of bitumen makes its\nextraction a\nchallenging and resource-intensive process;\nthe most common extraction technique involves\npumping steam into the oil sands to lower the\nviscosity of bitumen in order to pump it to\nthe surface.\n\nOne of the most prominent issues concerning\noil sands is the large volume of greenhouse\ngases (GHG) associated with production. Oil\nsands are by far one of the most\nenergy-intensive forms of oil production,\nreleasing three times more GHG emissions from\nproduction than conventional oil.\n\nShareholders have kept up pressure on\nthe issue of potential long-term risks to\ncompanies posed by the environmental, social,\nand economic challenges associated with\nCanadian oil sands operations. Resolutions on\nthe topic have focused on requesting greater\ntransparency on the\nramifications of oil sands development\nprojects.\n\nArctic National Wildlife Refuge\n\nThe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is\na federally protected wilderness along\nAlaska\u0092s North Slope. In the past, legislation\nproposed in both the House\nand Senate that, if passed, would allow a\nportion of this area to be leased to private\ncompanies for development and production of\noil, has been witnessed. Oil companies have\nexpressed an interest in bidding for these\nleases given the opportunity.\nIn response, shareholder activists have filed\nresolutions asking these companies to cancel\nany plans to drill in the ANWR and cease their\nlobbying efforts to open the area for\ndrilling. Proponents of shareholder proposals\non this issue argue that\nthe Coastal Plain section of the ANWR is the\nmost environmentally sensitive area of the\nrefuge, that the majority of Alaska\u0092s North\nSlope that is not federally designated\nwilderness already provides the oil industry\nwith sufficient resources\nfor oil production, and that advocates of\ndrilling in ANWR overstate the benefit to be\nderived from opening the wilderness to oil\nproduction. Those in favor of opening the area\nup to drilling note that only a small portion\nof ANWR would be\nconsidered for exploration, and if drilling\nwere to take place, it would be on less than\none percent of the entire area, that modern\ntechnology reduces the environmental impact of\noil drilling on both the land and surrounding\nwildlife, and that oil\nproduction in ANWR would have considerable\nbenefit to company shareholders, Alaskans, and\nthe United States as a whole.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for requests for reports on       \n       potential environmental damage as a    \n  \u220e    result of company operations in        \n       protected                              \n       regions.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals asking  \n       companies to prepare reports or adopt  \n  \u220e    policies on operations that include    \n       mining,                                \n       drilling or logging in                 \n       environmentally sensitive areas.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       seeking to curb or reduce the sale of  \n  \u220e    products manufactured from materials   \n       extracted from                         \n       environmentally sensitive areas such   \n       as old growth forests.                 \n                                              \nHydraulic Fracturing\n\nShareholder proponents have elevated concerns\non the use of hydraulic fracturing, an\nincreasingly controversial process in which\nwater, sand, and a mix of chemicals\nare blasted horizontally into tight layers of\nshale rock to extract natural gas.

Shareholder\nproponents, activists and even some\nlegislators have called upon drug companies to\nrestrain pricing of prescription drugs.\n\nThe high cost of prescription drugs is a vital\nissue for senior citizens across the country.\nSeniors have the greatest need for\nprescription drugs, accounting for a\nsignificant portion of all prescription drug\nsales, but they often live on fixed incomes\nand are underinsured.\n\nProponents note that efforts to reign-in\npharmaceutical costs will not negatively\nimpact research and development (R&D) costs\nand that retail drug prices are consistently\nhigher in the U.S. than in other\nindustrialized nations. Pharmaceutical\ncompanies often respond that adopting a formal\ndrug pricing policy could put the company at a\ncompetitive disadvantage.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the AIDS crisis\nin Africa, many shareholders have called on\ncompanies to address the issue of affordable\ndrugs for the treatment of AIDS, as well as\ntuberculosis and malaria throughout the\ndeveloping world. When analyzing such\nresolutions, consideration should be\nmade of the strategic implications of pricing\npolicies in the market.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n  \u220e    Vote for shareholder proposals to      \n       prepare a report on drug pricing.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals to      \n  \u220e    adopt a formal policy on drug          \n       pricing.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    77\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals that    \n       call on companies to develop a policy  \n  \u220e    to provide affordable HIV, AIDS,       \n       tuberculosis, and malaria drugs in     \n       third-world nations.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for proposals asking for reports  \n       on the economic effects and legal      \n  \u220e    risks of limiting pharmaceutical       \n       products to                            \n       Canada or certain wholesalers.         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case proposals            \n       requesting                             \n  \u220e    that companies adopt policies not to   \n       constrain prescription drug            \n       re-importation by limiting supplies    \n       to foreign markets.                    \n                                              \nGovernment and Military\n\nWeapons-related proposals\nmay target handguns, landmines, defense\ncontracting, or sale of weapons to foreign\ngovernments.\n\nPrepare Report to Renounce Future Landmine\nProduction\n\nAlthough very few companies currently produce\nlandmines, some companies continue to have\nlinks to landmine production or produce\ncomponents that are used to make landmines.\nShareholders have asked companies to renounce\nthe future development of landmines or their\ncomponents, or to prepare a report on the\nfeasibility of such a renouncement.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals seeking a report on\nthe renouncement of future landmine\nproduction.\n\nPrepare Report on Foreign Military Sales\n\nShareholders have filed proxy resolutions\nasking companies to account for their policies\nsurrounding the sale of military equipment to\nforeign\ngovernments.

of improvements in fuel efficiency\nstandards in the U.S. automotive industry, and\nthe highly litigious nature surrounding the\ntobacco industry as rationales for greater\ntransparency on corporate\nlobbying practices that would shed light on\nwhether companies are acting in the best long-\nterm interests of their shareholders.\nProponents of lobbying resolutions typically\nrequest

Federal Election\nCommission that lifted restrictions on\ncorporate spending in federal elections,\nchanges in legislation that governs corporate\npolitical giving have, rather than limiting\nsuch

resolutions\ngenerally call for enhanced disclosure of\npolitical contributions, including a report on\nthe policies and procedures for corporate\npolitical campaign contributions and trade\nassociation expenditures, the respective\namounts of such donations using\ncompany funds, or an assessment of the impacts\nof such contributions on the firm\u0092s image,\nsales and

Social Advisory\nServices is generally supportive of increased\ntransparency around corporate charitable\ngiving. However, some resolutions extend\nbeyond mere disclosure requests and\nattempt to influence or restrict companies\u0092\ncontributions to specific types of\nbeneficiaries in a manner that furthers\nparticular objectives supported by the\nproposal sponsors. Social Advisory Services\nbelieves that management is better\npositioned to decide what criteria are\nappropriate for making corporate charitable\ncontributions. Also, some of the proposals may\nrequire companies to poll their shareholders\nas part of the grant-making process. Since\nmajority of companies generally\nhave thousands of shareholders, contacting,\nconfirming, and processing each individual\nopinion and/or consent would be a burdensome\nand expensive exercise.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Generally vote for shareholder         \n  \u220e    resolutions seeking enhanced           \n       transparency on corporate              \n       philanthropy.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against shareholder proposals     \n  \u220e    imposing charitable giving criteria    \n       or requiring shareholder ratification  \n       of grants.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote against shareholder proposals     \n  \u220e    requesting that companies prohibit     \n       charitable contributions.              \n                                              \nDisclosure on Prior Government Service\n\nShareholders have asked companies to disclose\nthe identity of any senior executive and/or\nother high-level employee, consultant,\nlobbyist, attorney, or investment\nbanker who has served in government. Although\nthe movement of individuals between government\nand the private sector may benefit both, the\npotential also exists for conflicts of\ninterest, especially in industries that have\nextensive dealings with\ngovernment agencies.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals calling for the\ndisclosure of prior government service of the\ncompany\u0092s key executives.\n\nConsumer Lending and Economic Development\n\nAdopt Policy/Report on Predatory Lending\nPractices\n\nPredatory lending involves charging excessive\nfees to subprime borrowers without adequate\ndisclosure. More specifically, predatory\nlending includes misleading\nsubprime borrowers about the terms of a loan,\ncharging excessive fees that are folded into\nthe body of a refinancing loan, including life\ninsurance policies or other unnecessary\nadditions to a mortgage, or lending to\nhomeowners with insufficient\nincome to cover loan payments.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals seeking the\ndevelopment of a policy or preparation of a\nreport to guard against predatory lending\npractices.\n\nDisclosure on Credit in Low-and Lower-middle-\nincome countries (LMIC) or Forgive LMIC Debt\n\nShareholders have asked banks and other\nfinancial services firms to develop and\ndisclose lending policies for\nlow- and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC).\nProponents are concerned that, without such\npolicies, lending to LMIC may contribute to\nthe outflow of capital, the inefficient use of\ncapital, and corruption,\nall of which increase the risk of loan loss.\nIn the interest of promoting improved LMIC\nlending practices and responsible loan\ndisclosure, Social Advisory Services generally\nsupports voting for such proposals. In cases\nwhere it can be determined\nthat companies have been proactive and\nresponsible in developing such policies,\nSocial Advisory Services may recommend a vote\nagainst the proposal\u0092s adoption. Social\nAdvisory Services usually opposes proposals\nthat call for outright loan\nforgiveness; such action represents\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    81\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nan unacceptable loss to lending institutions\nand their\nshareholders.

Such proposals also ask\ncompanies to review their\npolicies regarding their investments in\ndifferent communities.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor proposals that seek a policy review or\nreport addressing the company\u0092s community\ninvesting efforts.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nAdult Entertainment\n\nTraditionally, there have not been many\nproposals filed in the area of adult\nentertainment. However, with the consolidation\nof the\ncommunications industry, a number of large\ncompanies have ended up with ownership of\ncable companies. These cable companies may\noffer their customers access to\npay-per-view programming or channels intended\nfor adult audiences. Proponents of shareholder\nproposals on this issue ask cable companies\nand companies with interests in\ncable companies to assess the costs and\nbenefits of continuing to distribute sexually-\nexplicit content, including the potential\nnegative impact on the company\u0092s image.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals that seek a review\nof the company\u0092s involvement with pornography.\n\nAbortion/Right to Life Issues\n\nShareholder proposals pertaining to abortion\nand right to life issues have appeared more\nfrequently recently, especially in the\naftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court\ndecision overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nSocial Advisory Services considers each\nshareholder proposals on its individual merit,\nrather than relying on a wide-reaching policy\napplication, and considers numerous\ncontributing factors such as\nlegislative updates, health privacy rights,\nand language of the proposal.\n\nSocial Advisory Services\nRecommendation:Decided on a case-by-casebasis.\n\nAnti-Social Proposals\n\nA number of\n\u0091anti-social\u0092 shareholder proposals have been\nfiled at companies requesting increased\ndisclosure. While these proposals\u0092 requests\nare very similar to those submitted by\nshareholder advocates within traditional\nsocially responsible\ninvestor circles, the underlying motives for\nfiling the proposals appear to be very\ndifferent. In addition to charitable\ncontribution proposals, anti-social proposals\naddressing climate change, sustainability, and\nconflicts of interest may be seen\nat shareholder meetings. Despite implicitly\ndifferent motivations in some of these\nproposals, the underlying requests for\nincreased disclosure, in some cases, may be\nworth shareholder support.\n                                              \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009    82\u00a0of\u00a088  \n  C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M                                 \n                                              \nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote against shareholder proposals     \n  \u220e    that do not seek to ultimately         \n       advance the goals of the social        \n       investment community.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote case-by-case on anti-social       \n  \u220e    shareholder proposals seeking a        \n       review or report on the company\u0092s       \n       charitable contributions.              \n                                              \nViolence and Adult Themes in Video Games\n\nPerceptions of increased sex and violence in\nvideo games have led certain shareholders to\nquestion the availability of\nadult-themed content to children and teens.\nThe Entertainment Software Ratings Board,\nwhich provides ratings for video games, has\nclassified approximately 34 percent of the\ntotal games it reviews as either Teen, Mature,\nor Adults Only.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:Vote\nfor shareholder proposals asking for reports\non company policies related to the sale of\nmature-rated video games to children and\nteens.\n\nLink Compensation to Non-FinancialFactors\n\nProponents of these proposals feel that social\nand environmental\ncriteria should be factored into the formulas\nused in determining executive compensation\npackages. The shareholder sponsors of the\nresolutions look to companies to review\ncurrent compensation practices and to include\nsocial or environmental\nperformance criteria such as accounting for\n\u0093poor corporate citizenship\u0094 and meeting\nenvironmental or workplace safety objectives\nand metrics when evaluating executive\ncompensation. Some of the\nnon-financial criteria that proponents of\nthese resolutions seek to be incorporated in\ncompensation program design include workplace\nsafety, environmental stewardship, or\ndiversity and customer/employee\nsatisfaction \u0096 as part of a written policy\nused to align compensation with performance on\nnon-financial factors alongside financial\ncriteria.\n\nProponents believe that factors such as poor\nenvironmental performance, workplace lawsuits,\netc. could have a significant adverse impact\non a company\u0092s financial\nperformance if not proactively and adequately\naddressed, and that these factors should be\nconsidered along with traditional financial\nconsiderations when determining executive pay.\nThe significant stock price declines and\nmassive losses in\nshareholder value stemming from the BP\nDeepwater Horizon oil rig disaster and the\ntragic explosion at Massey Energy\u0092s Upper Big\nBranch mine that killed 29 employees is a\nsobering reminder of the need to have the\nright management incentives in\nplace to ensure that social and environmental\nrisks are actively managed and mitigated\nagainst. Given the proliferation of derivative\nlawsuits targeted at firms such as\nHalliburton, Transocean and Cameron\nInternational that were suppliers to or\npartners with BP in a capacity that ignored\nsafety considerations or that contributed to\nthe economic and ecological disaster,\ninvestors are increasingly mindful of the far-\nreaching implications that exposure\nto social or environmental risks could have on\nshareholder value at portfolio companies.\n\nSocial Advisory Services Recommendation:\n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n       calling for linkage of executive pay   \n       to                                     \n       non-financial factors including        \n  \u220e    performance against social and         \n       environmental goals,                   \n       customer/employee satisfaction,        \n       corporate downsizing, community        \n       involvement, human rights, or          \n       predatory lending.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Vote for shareholder proposals         \n  \u220e    seeking reports on linking executive   \n       pay to                                 \n       non-financial factors.                 \n                                              \n                             \n  9.
