The\nfinancial statements, including the accounting\npolicies, and schedule of investments for the\nunderlying fund are available on\niShares.comand should be read in conjunction\nwith the Fund\u2019s financial statements.\n                                              \n  2.\u2003SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES          \n                                              \nThe financial statements are prepared in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), which may require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities in the financial statements,\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nincreases and decreases in net assets from\noperations during the reporting period. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates. The\nFund is considered an investment company under\nU.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and\nreporting guidance applicable to investment\ncompanies. Below is a summary of significant\naccounting policies:\n\nInvestment Transactions and Income\nRecognition:For financial reporting purposes,\ninvestment transactions are recorded on the\ndates the transactions are executed. Realized\ngains and losses on investment transactions\nare determined using the specific\nidentification method. Dividend income and\ncapital gain distributions, if any, are\nrecorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash\ndividends, if any, are recorded on the ex-\ndividend date at fair value.\n\nBank Overdraft:The Fund had outstanding cash\ndisbursements exceeding deposited cash amounts\nat the custodian during the reporting period.\nThe Fund is obligated to repay the custodian\nfor any overdraft, including any related costs\nor expenses, where applicable. For financial\nreporting purposes, overdraft fees, if any,\nare included in interest expense in the\nStatement of Operations.\n\nCollateralization:If required by an exchange\nor counterparty agreement, the Fund may be\nrequired to deliver/deposit cash and/or\nsecurities to/with an exchange, or broker-\ndealer or custodian as collateral for certain\ninvestments.\n\nIn-kindRedemptions:For financial reporting\npurposes, in-kind redemptions are treated as\nsales of securities resulting in realized\ncapital gains or losses to the Fund. Because\nsuch gains or losses are not taxable to the\nFund and are not distributed to existing Fund\nshareholders, the gains or losses are\nreclassified from accumulated net realized\ngain (loss) to paid-in capital at the end of\nthe Fund\u2019s tax year. These reclassifications\nhave no effect on net assets or net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share.\n\nDistributions:Dividends and distributions paid\nby the Fund are recorded on the ex-dividend\ndates. Distributions are determined on a tax\nbasis and may differ from net investment\nincome and net realized capital gains for\nfinancial reporting purposes. Dividends and\ndistributions are paid in U.S. dollars and\ncannot be automatically reinvested in\nadditional shares of the Fund.\n\nIndemnifications:In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Fund enter into contracts that\ncontain a variety of representations that\nprovide general indemnification. The Fund\u2019s\nmaximum exposure under these arrangements is\nunknown because it involves future potential\nclaims against the Fund, which cannot be\npredicted with any certainty.\n3. INVESTMENT VALUATION AND FAIR VALUE\nMEASUREMENTS\nInvestment Valuation Policies:The Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are valued at fair value (also\nreferred to as \u201cmarket value\u201d within the\nfinancial statements) each day that the Fund\u2019s\nlisting exchange is open and, for financial\nreporting purposes, as of the report date.\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price a\nfund would receive to sell an asset or pay to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d) of the Fund has approved the\ndesignation of BlackRock Fund Advisors\n(\u201cBFA\u201d), the Fund\u2019s investment adviser, as the\nvaluation designee for the Fund. The Fund\ndetermines the fair values of its financial\ninstruments using various independent dealers\nor pricing services under BFA\u2019s policies. If a\nsecurity\u2019s market price is not readily\navailable or does not otherwise accurately\nrepresent the fair value of the security, the\nsecurity will be valued in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value. BFA has formed a committee (the\n\u201cValuation Committee\u201d) to develop pricing\npolicies and procedures and to oversee the\npricing function for all financial\ninstruments, with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees.\n\nFair Value Inputs and Methodologies:The\nfollowing methods and inputs are used to\nestablish the fair value of the Fund\u2019s assets\nand liabilities:\n                                              \n       Exchange-traded funds and closed-end   \n       funds traded on a recognized           \n       securities exchange are valued at      \n       that day\u2019s official closing price, as  \n  \u00b7    applicable, on the exchange where the  \n       fund is primarily traded. Funds        \n       traded on a recognized exchange for    \n       which there were no sales on that day  \n       may be valued at the last traded       \n       price.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Investments in open-end U.S. mutual    \n  \u00b7    funds (including money market funds)   \n       are valued at that day\u2019s published     \n       NAV.                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Futures contracts are valued based on  \n  \u00b7    that day\u2019s last reported settlement    \n       or trade price on the exchange where   \n       the contract is traded.                \n                                              \n                                              \n        2 0 2 4\u2002 I S H A R E S\u2002 A N N U A L\u2002  \n  10    F I N A N C I A L\u2002 S T A T E M E N T  \n        S                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n   Notes to Financial Statements(continued)   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Flexible Exchange Options (\u201cFLEX       \n       Options\u201d) are valued at the last       \n       executed trade price on the options    \n       market in which the options trade. If  \n       there were no executed trades, FLEX    \n  \u00b7    Options are valued by an independent   \n       pricing service using a mathematical   \n       model, such as Black-Scholes model,    \n       which incorporates a number of market  \n       data factors, such as trades and       \n       prices of the underlying instruments.  \n                                              \nIf events (e.g., market volatility, company\nannouncement or a natural disaster) occur that\nare expected to materially affect the value of\nsuch investment, or in the event that\napplication of these methods of valuation\nresults in a price for an investment that is\ndeemed not to be representative of the market\nvalue of such investment, or if a price is not\navailable, the investment will be valued by\nthe Valuation Committee, in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures as reflecting\nfair value (\u201cFair Valued Investments\u201d). The\nfair valuation approaches that may be used by\nthe Valuation Committee include market\napproach, income approach and cost approach.\nValuation techniques such as discounted cash\nflow, use of market comparables and matrix\npricing are types of valuation approaches and\nare typically used in determining fair value.\nWhen determining the price for Fair Valued\nInvestments, the Valuation Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that the Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive or pay from the\ncurrent sale or purchase of that asset or\nliability in an arm\u2019s-length transaction. Fair\nvalue determinations shall be based upon all\navailable factors that the Valuation Committee\ndeems relevant and consistent with the\nprinciples of fair value measurement.\n\nFair Value Hierarchy:Various inputs are used\nin determining the fair value of financial\ninstruments. These inputs to valuation\ntechniques are categorized into a fair value\nhierarchy consisting of three broad levels for\nfinancial reporting purposes as follows:\n                                              \n       Level\u00a01 \u2013 Unadjusted price quotations  \n  \u00b7    in active markets/exchanges for        \n       identical assets or liabilities that   \n       the Fund has the ability to access;    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Level\u00a02 \u2013 Other observable inputs      \n       (including, but not limited to,        \n       quoted prices for similar assets or    \n       liabilities in markets that are        \n       active, quoted prices for identical    \n       or similar assets or liabilities in    \n       markets that are not active, inputs    \n  \u00b7    other than quoted prices that are      \n       observable for the assets or           \n       liabilities (such as interest rates,   \n       yield curves, volatilities,            \n       prepayment speeds, loss severities,    \n       credit risks and default rates) or     \n       other market\u2013corroborated inputs);     \n       and                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Level\u00a03 \u2013 Unobservable inputs based    \n       on the best information available in   \n       the circumstances, to the extent       \n  \u00b7    observable inputs are not available    \n       (including the Valuation Committee\u2019s   \n       assumptions used in determining the    \n       fair value of financial instruments).  \n                                              \nThe hierarchy gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1\nmeasurements) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised\nin determining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3. The inputs\nused to measure fair value may fall into\ndifferent levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn such cases, for disclosure purposes, the\nfair value hierarchy classification is\ndetermined based on the lowest level input\nthat is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. Investments\nclassified within Level 3 have significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Valuation\nCommittee in determining the price for Fair\nValued Investments. Level 3 investments\ninclude equity or debt issued by privately\nheld companies or funds that may not have a\nsecondary market and/or may have a limited\nnumber of investors. The categorization of a\nvalue determined for financial instruments is\nbased on the pricing transparency of the\nfinancial instruments and is not necessarily\nan indication of the risks associated with\ninvesting in those securities.\n                                              \n   4.\u2003DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS        \n                                              \nFutures Contracts:Futures contracts are\npurchased or sold to gain exposure to, or\nmanage exposure to, changes in interest rates\n(interest rate risk) and changes in the value\nof equity securities (equity risk) or foreign\ncurrencies (foreign currency exchange rate\nrisk).\n\nFutures contracts are exchange-traded\nagreements between the Fund and a counterparty\nto buy or sell a specific quantity of an\nunderlying instrument at a specified price and\non a specified date. Depending on the terms of\na contract, it is settled either through\nphysical delivery of the underlying instrument\non the settlement date or by payment of a cash\namount on the settlement date. Upon entering\ninto a futures contract, the Fund are required\nto deposit initial margin with the broker in\nthe form of cash or securities in an amount\nthat varies depending on a contract\u2019s size and\nrisk profile. The initial margin deposit must\nthen be maintained to an established level\nover the life of the contract. Amounts\npledged, which are considered restricted, are\nincluded in cash pledged for futures contracts\nin the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\n\nSecurities deposited as initial margin are\ndesignated in the Schedule of Investment and\ncash deposited, if any, are shown as cash\npledged for futures contracts in the Statement\nof Assets and Liabilities. Pursuant to the\ncontract, the Fund agree to receive from or\npay to the broker an amount of cash equal to\nthe daily fluctuation in market value of the\ncontract (\u201cvariation margin\u201d). Variation\nmargin is recorded as unrealized appreciation\n(depreciation) and, if any, shown as variation\nmargin receivable (or payable) on futures\ncontracts in the Statement of Assets and\nLiabilities. When the contract is closed, a\nrealized gain or loss is recorded in the\nStatement of Operations equal to the\ndifference between the notional amount of the\ncontract at the time it was opened and the\nnotional amount at the time it was closed. The\nuse of futures contracts involves the risk of\nan imperfect correlation in the movements in\nthe price of futures contracts and interest\nrates, foreign currency exchange rates or\nunderlying assets.\n\nOptions:An options contract is an agreement\nbetween a buyer and seller that gives the\npurchaser of the option the right to buy (in\nthe case of a call option) or sell (in the\ncase of a put option) a particular asset at a\nspecified future date at an agreed upon price\n(commonly known as the \u201cstrike price\u201d).\n\nThe Fund invests primarily in FLEX Options.\nFLEX Options provide the Fund with the ability\nto customize key option contract terms such as\nstrike price, style and expiration date, while\navoiding the counterparty exposure of over-\nthe-counter options positions. Like\ntraditional exchange-traded options, FLEX\nOptions are guaranteed for settlement by the\nOptions Clearing Corporation (the \u201cOCC\u201d), a\nmarket clearinghouse that guarantees\nperformance by counterparties to certain\nderivatives contracts. The FLEX Options in\nwhich the Fund invests are European-style,\nwhich are exercisable at the strike price only\non the expiration date. The FLEX Options\ntraded by the Fund are listed on the Chicago\nBoard Options Exchange (\u201cCBOE\u201d). Although the\nFund will generally utilize FLEX Options that\nare physically settled, a fund may also\nutilize FLEX Options that are cash-settled.\nCash-settled options give the holder the right\nto receive an amount (or owe an amount) of\ncash upon the exercise of the option.\n\nThe Fund will purchase and sell call and put\nEuropean-style FLEX Options. A European-style\ncall option gives the purchaser (holder) of\nthe option the right (but not then obligation)\nto buy, and obligates the seller (writer) to\nsell (when the option is exercised) the\nunderlying instrument at the exercise or\nstrike price on the expiration date. A\nEuropean-style put option gives the seller\n(holder) of the option the right (but not the\nobligation) to sell, and obligates the buyer\n(writer) to buy (when the option is exercised)\nthe underlying instrument at the exercise or\nstrike price on the expiration date.\n                                              \n  N O T E S T O F I N A N C I A L S T         \n  A T E M E N T                           11  \n  S                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n   Notes to Financial Statements(continued)   \n                                              \nPremiums paid on options purchased and\npremiums received on options written, as well\nas the daily fluctuation in market value, are\nincluded in investments at value \u2013\nunaffiliated and options written at value,\nrespectively, in the Statement of Assets and\nLiabilities. When an instrument is purchased\nor sold through the exercise of an option, the\npremium is offset against the cost or proceeds\nof the underlying instrument. When an option\nexpires, a realized gain or loss is recorded\nin the Statement of Operations to the extent\nof the premiums received or paid. When an\noption is closed or sold, a gain or loss is\nrecorded in the Statement of Operations to the\nextent the cost of the closing transaction\nexceeds the premiums received or paid. When\nthe Fund writes put options, cash is\nsegregated in an amount sufficient to cover\nthe obligations. These amounts, which are\nconsidered restricted, are included in cash\npledged as collateral for options written in\nthe Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\n\nIn purchasing and writing options, the Fund\nbears the risk of an unfavorable change in the\nvalue of the underlying instrument or the risk\nthat they may not be able to enter into a\nclosing transaction due to an illiquid market.\n5.

The value of\nsecurities or other instruments may also be\naffected by various factors, including,\nwithout limitation: (i) the general economy;\n(ii) the overall market as well as local,\nregional or global political and/or social\ninstability; (iii) regulation, taxation or\ninternational tax treaties between various\ncountries; or (iv) currency, interest rate or\nprice fluctuations. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious illness or other public\nhealth issues, recessions, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments. The Fund\u2019s prospectus\nprovides details of the risks to which the\nFund is subject.\n\nValuation Risk:The market values of equities,\nsuch as common stocks and preferred securities\nor equity related investments, such as futures\nand options, may decline due to general market\nconditions which are not specifically related\nto a particular company. They may also decline\ndue to factors which affect a particular\nindustry or industries. A fund may invest in\nilliquid investments. An illiquid investment\nis any investment that a fund reasonably\nexpects cannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in seven calendar\ndays or less without the sale or disposition\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. A fund may experience difficulty\nin selling illiquid investments in a timely\nmanner at the price that it believes the\ninvestments are worth. Prices may fluctuate\nwidely over short or extended periods in\nresponse to company, market or economic news.\nMarkets also tend to move in cycles, with\nperiods of rising and falling prices. This\nvolatility may cause a fund\u2019s NAV to\nexperience significant increases or decreases\nover short periods of time. If there is a\ngeneral decline in the securities and other\nmarkets, the NAV of a fund may lose value,\nregardless of the individual results of the\nsecurities and other instruments in which a\nfund invests.\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk:The Fund may be\nexposed to counterparty credit risk, or the\nrisk that an entity may fail to or be unable\nto perform on its commitments related to\nunsettled or open transactions, including\nmaking timely interest and/or principal\npayments or otherwise honoring its\nobligations. The Fund manages counterparty\ncredit risk by entering into transactions only\nwith counterparties that BFA believes have the\nfinancial resources to honor their obligations\nand by monitoring the financial stability of\nthose counterparties. Financial assets, which\npotentially expose the Fund to market, issuer\nand counterparty credit risks, consist\nprincipally of financial instruments and\nreceivables due from counterparties. The\nextent of the Fund\u2019s exposure to market,\nissuer and counterparty credit risks with\nrespect to these financial assets is\napproximately their value recorded in the\nStatement of Assets and Liabilities, less any\ncollateral held by the Fund.\n\nA derivative contract may suffer a mark-to-\nmarket loss if the value of the contract\ndecreases due to an unfavorable change in the\nmarket rates or values of the underlying\ninstrument. Losses can also occur if the\ncounterparty does not perform under the\ncontract.\n\nWith exchange-traded futures, there is less\ncounterparty credit risk to the Fund since the\nexchange or clearinghouse, as counterparty to\nsuch instruments, guarantees against a\npossible default. The clearinghouse stands\nbetween the buyer and the seller of the\ncontract; therefore, credit risk is limited to\nfailure of the clearinghouse. While offset\nrights may exist under applicable law, the\nFund does not have a contractual right of\noffset against a clearing broker or\nclearinghouse in the event of a default\n(including the bankruptcy or insolvency).\nAdditionally, credit risk exists in exchange-\ntraded futures with respect to initial and\nvariation margin that is held in a clearing\nbroker\u2019s customer accounts. While clearing\nbrokers are required to segregate customer\nmargin from their own assets, in the event\nthat a clearing broker becomes insolvent or\ngoes into bankruptcy and at that time there is\na shortfall in the aggregate amount of margin\nheld by the clearing broker for all its\nclients, typically the shortfall would be\nallocated on a pro rata basis across all the\nclearing broker\u2019s customers, potentially\nresulting in losses to the Fund.\n\nGeographic/Asset ClassRisk:A diversified\nportfolio, where this is appropriate and\nconsistent with a fund\u2019s objectives, minimizes\nthe risk that a price change of a particular\ninvestment will have a material impact on the\nNAV of a fund. The investment concentrations\nwithin the Fund\u2019s portfolio are disclosed in\nits Schedule of Investments.\n\nThe Fund invests a significant portion of its\nassets in securities of issuers located in the\nUnited States. A decrease in imports or\nexports, changes in trade regulations,\ninflation and/or an economic recession in the\nUnited States may have a material adverse\neffect on the U.S. economy and the securities\nlisted on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted\npolicy and legislative changes in the United\nStates may also have a significant effect on\nU.S. markets generally, as well as on the\nvalue of certain securities. Governmental\nagencies project that the United States will\ncontinue to maintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable future which may\nconstrain future economic growth.\nCircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal on\nU.S. government debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201cdebt ceiling.\u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. If U.S. relations\nwith certain countries deteriorate, it could\nadversely affect issuers that rely on the\nUnited States for trade. The United States has\nalso experienced increased internal unrest and\ndiscord. If these trends were to continue,\nthey may have an adverse impact on the U.S.\neconomy and the issuers in which the Fund\ninvests.\n                                              \n  N O T E S T O F I N A N C I A L S T         \n  A T E M E N T                           13  \n  S                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n   Notes to Financial Statements(continued)   \n                                              \nSignificant Shareholder Redemption\nRisk:Certain shareholders may own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of fund shares and/or hold\ntheir fund investments for a limited period of\ntime. Large redemptions of fund shares by\nthese shareholders may force a fund to sell\nportfolio securities, which may negatively\nimpact the fund\u2019s NAV, increase the fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs, and/or accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income/gains and cause\nthe fund to make additional taxable\ndistributions to shareholders.\n\nFLEX Options Risk:FLEX Options are subject to\nthe risk that they may be less liquid than\ncertain other securities, such as standardized\noptions. In less liquid markets, terminating\nthe FLEX Options may require the payment of a\npremium or acceptance of a discounted price\nand may take longer to complete. In a less\nliquid market, the liquidation of a large\nnumber of options may significantly impact the\nprice of the options and may adversely impact\nthe value of the Fund.

The Independent Board Members requested,\nand BFA provided, such information as the\nIndependent Board Members, with advice from\nindependent counsel, deemed reasonably\nnecessary to evaluate the terms of the\nproposed Advisory Agreement. At a meeting held\non June 3-5, 2024, the Board, including the\nIndependent Board Members, approved the\nselection of BFA as investment adviser and\napproved the proposed Advisory Agreement for\nthe Fund, based on a review of qualitative and\nquantitative information provided by BFA. The\nBoard also considered information previously\nprovided by BFA, BlackRock Institutional Trust\nCompany, N.A. (\u201cBTC\u201d), and BlackRock, Inc.\n(\u201cBlackRock\u201d), as applicable, at prior Board\nmeetings. The Independent Board Members were\nadvised by their independent counsel\nthroughout the process, including about the\nlegal standards applicable to their review. In\napproving the Advisory Agreement for the Fund,\nthe Board, including the Independent Board\nMembers, considered various factors,\nincluding: (i) the expenses of the Fund; (ii)\nthe nature, extent and quality of the services\nto be provided by BFA; (iii) the costs of\nservices to be provided to the Fund and the\navailability of information related to profits\nto be realized by BFA and its affiliates; (iv)\npotential economies of scale; (v) the fees and\nservices provided for other comparable\nfunds/accounts managed by BFA and its\naffiliates; and (vi) other benefits to BFA\nand/or its affiliates. The material factors,\nno one of which was controlling, and\nconclusions that formed the basis for the\nBoard, including the Independent Board\nMembers, to approve the Advisory Agreement are\ndiscussed below.\n\nExpenses of the Fund:The Board reviewed\nstatistical information prepared by Broadridge\nFinancial Solutions Inc. (\u201cBroadridge\u201d), an\nindependent provider of investment company\ndata, regarding the expense ratio components\nof the Fund in comparison with the same\ninformation for other ETFs, objectively\nselected by Broadridge as comprising the\nFund\u2019s applicable expense peer group pursuant\nto Broadridge\u2019s proprietary ETF methodology\n(the \u201cPeer Group\u201d). The Board was provided\nwith a detailed description of the proprietary\nETF methodology used by Broadridge to\ndetermine the Fund\u2019s Peer Group. The Board\nnoted that due to the limitations in providing\ncomparable funds in the Peer Group, the\nstatistical information provided in\nBroadridge\u2019s report may or may not provide\nmeaningful direct comparisons to the Fund in\nall instances.\n\nThe Board also noted that the investment\nadvisory fee rate and overall expenses (net of\nany waivers and reimbursements) for the Fund\nwere lower than the median of the investment\nadvisory fee rates and overall expenses (net\nof any waivers and reimbursements) of the\nfunds in its Peer Group, excluding iShares\nfunds.\n\nBased on this review, the other factors\nconsidered at the meeting, and their general\nknowledge of ETF pricing, the Board concluded\nthat the investment advisory fee rate and\nexpense level of the Fund supported the\nBoard\u2019s approval of the Advisory Agreement.\n\nNature, Extent and Quality of Services to be\nProvided by BFA:The Board reviewed the scope\nof services to be provided by BFA under the\nAdvisory Agreement. In reviewing the scope of\nthese services, the Board considered BFA\u2019s\ninvestment philosophy and experience, noting\nthat BFA and its affiliates have committed\nsignificant resources over time and have made\nsignificant investments into the iShares\nbusiness to support the iShares funds and\ntheir shareholders. The Board considered\nrepresentations by BFA, BTC, and BlackRock\nthat the scope and quality of services to be\nprovided to the Fund would be similar to the\nscope and quality of services provided to\nother iShares funds. The Board also considered\nBFA\u2019s compliance program and its compliance\nrecord with respect to other iShares funds\nincluding related programs implemented\npursuant to regulatory requirements. In that\nregard, the Board noted that BFA reports to\nthe Board about portfolio management and\ncompliance matters on a periodic basis in\nconnection with regularly scheduled meetings\nof the Board, and on other occasions as\nnecessary and appropriate, and has provided\ninformation and made relevant officers and\nother employees of BFA (and its affiliates)\navailable as needed to provide further\nassistance with these matters. The Board also\nreviewed the background and experience of the\npersons who will be responsible for the day-\nto-day management of the Fund, as well as the\nresources that will be available to them in\nmanaging the Fund. The Board also considered\ndetailed presentations regarding BFA\u2019s\ninvestment performance, investment and risk\nmanagement processes and strategies, which\nwere provided throughout the year with respect\nto other iShares funds, and other matters\nrelated to BFA\u2019s portfolio compliance program\nand other compliance programs and services.\n\nBased on review of this information, the Board\nconcluded that the nature, extent and quality\nof services to be provided to the Fund under\nthe Advisory Agreement supported the Board\u2019s\napproval of the Advisory Agreement.\n\nCosts of Services to be Provided to the Fund\nand Profits to be Realized by BFA and\nAffiliates:The Board did not consider the\nprofitability of the Fund to BFA based on the\nfees payable under the Advisory Agreement or\nrevenue to be received by BFA or its\naffiliates in connection with services to be\nprovided to the Fund since the proposed\nrelationship had not yet commenced. The Board\nnoted that it expects to receive profitability\ninformation from BFA periodically following\nthe Fund\u2019s launch and will thus be in a\nposition to evaluate whether any new or\nadditional breakpoints or other adjustments in\nFund fees would be appropriate.\n\nEconomies of Scale:The Board considered\ninformation that it had previously received\nregarding potential economies of scale,\nefficiencies and scale benefits shared with\nthe iShares funds through relatively low fee\nrates established at inception, breakpoints\nand waivers or other fee reductions, as well\nas through additional investment in the\niShares business and the provision of improved\nor additional infrastructure and services to\nthe iShares funds and their shareholders.\n\nThis consideration of potential economies of\nscale and the sharing of related benefits, as\nwell as the other factors considered at the\nmeeting, supported the Board\u2019s approval of the\nAdvisory Agreement.\n\nFees and Services Provided for Other\nComparable Funds/Accounts Managed by BFA and\nits Affiliates:The Board received and\nconsidered information regarding the\ninvestment advisory/management fee rates for\nother funds/accounts in the U.S. for which BFA\n(or its affiliates) provides investment\nadvisory/management services, including open-\nend funds registered under the 1940 Act\n(including sub-advised funds), collective\ntrust funds, and institutional separate\naccounts (collectively, the \u201cOther Accounts\u201d).\nThe Board acknowledged BFA\u2019s representation\nthat the iShares funds are fundamentally\ndifferent investment vehicles from the Other\nAccounts. The Board noted that BFA and its\naffiliates do not manage Other Accounts with a\nsimilar investment strategy or investment\nmandate. The Board further noted that BFA\npreviously provided the Board with detailed\ninformation regarding how the Other Accounts\n(particularly institutional clients) generally\ndiffer from the iShares funds, including in\nterms of the different and generally more\nextensive services provided to the iShares\nfunds, as well as other significant\ndifferences. In that regard, the Board\nconsidered that the pricing of services to\ninstitutional clients is typically based on a\nnumber of factors beyond the nature and extent\nof the specific services to be provided and\noften depends on the overall relationship\nbetween the client and its affiliates and the\nadviser and its affiliates. In addition, the\nBoard considered the relative complexity and\ninherent risks and challenges of managing and\nproviding\n                                              \n  B O A R D R E V I E W A N D A P P R         \n  O V A L O F I                           17  \n  N V E S T M E N T A D V I S O R Y C         \n  O N T R A C T                               \n                                              \nBoard Review and Approval of Investment\nAdvisory Contract (continued)\nother services to the Fund, as a publicly\ntraded investment vehicle, as compared to the\nOther Accounts, particularly those that are\ninstitutional clients, in light of differing\nregulatory requirements and client-imposed\nmandates. The Board considered the \u201call-\ninclusive\u201d nature of the Fund\u2019s advisory fee\nstructure, and the Fund\u2019s expenses borne by\nBFA under this arrangement.\n\nOther Benefits to BFA and/or its\nAffiliates:Except as noted below, the Board\ndid not consider the \u201cfallout\u201d benefits or\nancillary revenue to be received by BFA and/or\nits affiliates in connection with the services\nto be provided to the Fund by BFA since the\nproposed relationship had not yet commenced.\nHowever, the Board considered the potential\npayment of advisory fees and/or administration\nfees to BFA (or its affiliates) in connection\nwith any investments by the Fund in other\nfunds for which BFA (or its affiliates)\nprovides investment advisory services and/or\nadministration services. The Board further\nconsidered other direct benefits that might\naccrue to BFA, including the potential for\nreduction in the Fund\u2019s expenses that are\nborne by BFA under the \u201call-inclusive\u201d\nmanagement fee arrangement, due in part to the\nsize and scope of BFA\u2019s investment operations\nservicing the Fund (and other funds in the\niShares complex) as well as in response to a\nchanging market environment. The Board also\nnoted the potential revenue to be received by\nBFA and/or its affiliates pursuant to an\nagreement that would permit a service provider\nto use certain portions of BlackRock\u2019s\ntechnology platform to service accounts\nmanaged by BFA and/or its affiliates,\nincluding the iShares funds. The Board also\nconsidered the potential for revenue to BTC,\nthe Fund\u2019s securities lending agent, and its\naffiliates in the event of any loaning of\nportfolio securities of the Fund. The Board\nalso reviewed and considered information\nprovided by BFA concerning authorized\nparticipant primary market order processing\nservices that will be provided by BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cBRIL\u201d), an affiliate of\nBFA, and paid for by authorized participants\nunder the ETF Servicing Platform. The Board\nnoted that BFA generally does not use soft\ndollars or consider the value of research or\nother services that may be provided to BFA\n(including its affiliates) in selecting\nbrokers for portfolio transactions for the\nFund. The Board concluded that any such\nancillary benefits would not be\ndisadvantageous to the Fund and thus would not\nalter the Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to\nthe appropriateness of approving the Advisory\nAgreement.\n\nConclusion:Based on a review of the factors\ndescribed above, as well as such other factors\nas deemed appropriate by the Board, the Board,\nincluding all of the Independent Board\nMembers, determined that the Fund\u2019s investment\nadvisory fee rate under the Advisory Agreement\ndoes not constitute a fee that is so\ndisproportionately large as to bear
