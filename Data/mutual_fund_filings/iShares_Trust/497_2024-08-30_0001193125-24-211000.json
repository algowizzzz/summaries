330\ninvestment series or portfolios. The Trust was\norganized as a Delaware statutory trust on\nDecember 16, 1999 and is authorized to have\nmultiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 Act.\nThe offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ). This SAI\nrelates solely to the Fund. The Fund is\nmanaged by BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d\n), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of\nBlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track\nthe investment results of the specific\nbenchmark index identified in the Fund's\nProspectus (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ). The\nFund offers and issues shares at their net\nasset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares\n(each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ), generally in\nexchange for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other positions\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) included in its\nUnderlying Index (the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d\nor \u201c Creation Basket \u201d ), together with the\ndeposit of a specified cash payment (the \u201c\nCash Component \u201d ). Shares of the Fund are\nlisted for trading on Cboe BZX (the \u201c Listing\nExchange \u201d ), a national securities exchange.\nShares of the Fund are traded in the secondary\nmarket and elsewhere at market prices that may\nbe at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares\nare redeemable only in Creation Units by\nAuthorized Participants (as defined in the\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role\nof the Authorized Participant section of this\nSAI), and, generally, in exchange for\nportfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as\ndefined in the Redemption of Creation Units\nsection of this SAI). Creation Units typically\nare a specified number of shares, generally\n80,000 or multiples thereof. The Trust\nreserves the right to permit or require that\ncreations and redemptions of shares are\neffected fully or partially in cash and\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of\ncash. Shares may be issued in advance of\nreceipt of Deposit Securities, subject to\nvarious conditions, including a requirement\nthat the Authorized Participant maintain with\nthe Trust collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\npurchase Deposit Securities. See the Creation\nand Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI. Transaction fees and other costs\nassociated with creations or redemptions that\ninclude a cash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin the Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of the Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe Prospectus. Shares of the Fund are listed\nfor trading, and trade throughout the day, on\nthe Listing Exchange and in other secondary\nmarkets. Shares of the Fund may also be listed\non certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no\nassurance that the requirements of the Listing\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nshares of the Fund will continue to be met.\nThe Listing Exchange may, but is not required\nto, remove the shares of the Fund from listing\nif, among other things: (i) following the\ninitial 12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of the Fund; (ii) the Fund is\nno longer eligible to operate in reliance on\nRule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act;\n(iii) any of the other listing requirements\nare not continuously maintained; or (iv) any\nevent shall occur or condition shall exist\nthat, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of the Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission determined by that broker, as well\nas other charges.\n\n1\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nshare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund. Investment\nStrategies and Risks The Fund seeks to achieve\nits objective by investing primarily in\nsecurities issued by issuers that compose the\nUnderlying Index and in investments that\nprovide substantially similar exposure to\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\noperates as an index fund and is not actively\nmanaged. Adverse performance of a security in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio will ordinarily not\nresult in the elimination of the security from\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio. The Fund engages in\nrepresentative sampling, which is investing in\na sample of securities selected by BFA to have\na collective investment profile similar to\nthat of the Fund's Underlying Index.\nSecurities selected have aggregate investment\ncharacteristics (based on market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability, earnings valuation and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to those of the\nFund\u2019s Underlying Index. A fund that uses\nrepresentative sampling generally does not\nhold all of the securities that are in its\nunderlying index. Although the Fund does not\nseek leveraged returns, certain instruments\nused by the Fund may have a leveraging effect\nas described below. Borrowing. The Fund may\nborrow for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The purchase\nof securities while borrowings are outstanding\nmay have the effect of leveraging the Fund.\nThe incurrence of leverage increases the\nFund\u2019s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds\nare subject to interest costs that will reduce\nnet income. Purchasing securities while\nborrowings are outstanding creates special\nrisks, such as the potential for greater\nvolatility in the NAV of Fund shares and in\nthe yield on the Fund\u2019s portfolio. In\naddition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the\namount available (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\nthe Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by the Fund must be made from a\nbank or may result in the Fund being subject\nto covenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire the Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Currency\nTransactions. A currency forward contract is\nan over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) obligation to\npurchase or sell a specific currency at a\nfuture date, which may be any fixed number of\ndays greater than two days from the date on\nwhich the contract is agreed upon by the\nparties, at a price set at the time of the\ncontract. A non-deliverable currency forward\nis an OTC currency forward settled in a\nspecified currency, on a specified date, based\non the difference between the agreed-upon\nexchange rate and the market exchange rate. A\ncurrency futures contract is a contract that\ntrades on an organized futures exchange\ninvolving an obligation to deliver or acquire\na specified amount of a specific currency, at\na specified price and at a specified future\ntime. Currency futures contracts may be\nsettled on a net cash payment basis rather\nthan by the sale and delivery of the\nunderlying currency. The Fund does not expect\nto engage in currency transactions for the\npurpose of hedging against declines in the\nvalue of the Fund's assets that are\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency. The Fund\nmay enter into non-U.S. currency forward and\nnon-U.S. currency futures transactions to\nfacilitate local securities settlements or to\nprotect against currency exposure in\nconnection with its distributions to\nshareholders, but may not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes. Foreign\nexchange transactions involve a significant\ndegree of risk and the markets in which\nforeign exchange transactions are effected may\nbe highly volatile, highly specialized and\nhighly technical. Significant changes,\nincluding changes in liquidity and prices, can\noccur in such markets within very short\nperiods of time, often within minutes. Foreign\nexchange trading risks include, but are not\nlimited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty\nrisk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and\npotential interference\n\n2\n\nby foreign governments through regulation of\nlocal exchange markets, foreign investment or\nparticular transactions in non-U.S. currency.\nIf BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions\nat an inappropriate time or judges market\nconditions, trends or correlations\nincorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may\nnot serve their intended purpose of improving\nthe correlation of the Fund's return with the\nperformance of the Underlying Index and may\nlower the Fund\u2019s return. The Fund could\nexperience losses if the value of its currency\nforwards, options or futures positions were\npoorly correlated with its other investments\nor if it could not close out its positions\nbecause of an illiquid market or otherwise. In\naddition, the Fund could incur transaction\ncosts, including trading commissions, in\nconnection with certain non-U.S. currency\ntransactions. Diversification Status. The Fund\nis classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d A \u201c non-\ndiversified \u201d fund is a fund that is not\nlimited by the 1940 Act with regard to the\npercentage of its assets that may be invested\nin the securities of a single issuer. The\nsecurities of a particular issuer (or\nsecurities of issuers in particular\nindustries) may constitute a significant\npercentage of the underlying index of such a\nfund and, consequently, the fund\u2019s investment\nportfolio. This may adversely affect the\nfund\u2019s performance or subject the fund\u2019s\nshares to greater price volatility than that\nexperienced by more diversified investment\ncompanies. The Fund intends to maintain the\nrequired level of diversification and\notherwise conduct its operations so as to\nqualify as a regulated investment company ( \u201c\nRIC \u201d ) for purposes of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c\nInternal Revenue Code \u201d ), and to relieve the\nFund of any liability for U.S. federal income\ntax to the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to shareholders, provided that the\nFund satisfies a minimum distribution\nrequirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective. Futures, Options on Futures and\nSecurities Options. Futures contracts, options\non futures and securities options may be used\nby the Fund to simulate investment in its\nUnderlying Index, to facilitate trading or to\nreduce transaction costs. The Fund may enter\ninto futures contracts and options on futures\nthat are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures\nexchange. The Fund will not use futures,\noptions on futures or securities options for\nspeculative purposes. The Fund intends to use\nfutures and options on futures in accordance\nwith Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under\nthe Commodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA,\nwith respect to the Fund, has claimed an\nexclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d in accordance with\nRule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to the\nFund, is not subject to registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under\nthe CEA. See the Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives section of this SAI for more\ninformation. Futures contracts provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. The\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, the Fund\nwill be required to deposit with the broker an\namount of cash or cash equivalents known as \u201c\ninitial margin, \u201d which is similar to a\nperformance bond or good faith deposit on the\ncontract and is returned to the Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, the Fund may elect to close the\nposition by taking an opposite position, which\nwill operate to terminate the Fund\u2019s existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof the Fund. The potential for loss related to\nwriting call options is unlimited. The\npotential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. The Fund may purchase and write put and\ncall options on futures contracts\n\n3\n\nthat are traded on an exchange as a hedge\nagainst changes in value of its portfolio\nsecurities or in anticipation of the purchase\nof securities, and may enter into closing\ntransactions with respect to such options to\nterminate existing positions. There is no\nguarantee that such closing transactions can\nbe effected. Securities options may be used by\nthe Fund to obtain access to securities in the\nUnderlying Index or to dispose of securities\nin the Underlying Index at favorable prices,\nto invest cash in a securities index that\noffers similar exposure to that provided by\nthe Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve\nthe Fund\u2019s objective of tracking the\nUnderlying Index. A call option gives a holder\nthe right to purchase a specific security at a\nspecified price ( \u201c exercise price \u201d ) within\na specified period of time. A put option gives\na holder the right to sell a specific security\nat an exercise price within a specified period\nof time. The initial purchaser of a call\noption pays the \u201c writer \u201d a premium, which is\npaid at the time of purchase and is retained\nby the writer whether or not such option is\nexercised. The Fund may purchase put options\nto hedge its portfolio against the risk of a\ndecline in the market value of securities held\nand may purchase call options to hedge against\nan increase in the price of securities it is\ncommitted to purchase. The Fund may write put\nand call options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. The Fund may purchase or sell\nsecurities options on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nsecurities exchange or in the OTC market\nthrough a transaction with a dealer. Options\non a securities index are typically settled on\na net basis based on the appreciation or\ndepreciation of the index level over the\nstrike price. Options on single name\nsecurities may be cash- or physically-settled,\ndepending upon the market in which they are\ntraded. Options may be structured so as to be\nexercisable only on certain dates or on a\ndaily basis. Options may also be structured to\nhave conditions to exercise ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-\nin Events \u201d ) or conditions that trigger\ntermination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out Events \u201d ).\nLending Portfolio Securities. The Fund may\nlend portfolio securities to certain borrowers\nthat BFA determines to be creditworthy,\nincluding borrowers affiliated with BFA. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is\nmaintained in an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent market value of the securities loaned.\nNo securities loan shall be made on behalf of\nthe Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value\nof all securities loans of the Fund exceeds\none-third of the value of the Fund's total\nassets (including the value of the collateral\nreceived). The Fund may terminate a loan at\nany time and obtain the return of the\nsecurities loaned. The Fund receives, by way\nof substitute payment, the value of any\ninterest or cash or non-cash distributions\npaid on the loaned securities that it would\nhave otherwise received if the securities were\nnot on loan. With respect to loans that are\ncollateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount\nof cash collateral. The Fund is compensated by\nany positive difference between the amount\nearned on the reinvestment of cash collateral\nand the fee paid to the borrower. In the case\nof collateral other than cash, the Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of the Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nThe Fund conducts its securities lending\npursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC\npermitting it to lend portfolio securities to\nborrowers affiliated with the Fund and to\nretain an affiliate of the Fund to act as\nsecurities lending agent. To the extent that\nthe Fund engages in securities lending,\nBlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (\n\u201c BTC \u201d ) acts as securities lending agent for\nthe Fund, subject to the overall supervision\nof BFA. BTC administers the lending program in\naccordance with guidelines approved by the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the\ntrustees of which are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ).\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d )\nserves as custodian for the Fund in connection\nwith certain securities lending activities.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk (\ni.e ., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk ( i.e ., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees the Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (\ni.e. , the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If the Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, the Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In\n\n4\n\nthe event a borrower does not return the\nFund\u2019s securities as agreed, the Fund\u2019s\nability to participate in a corporate action\nevent may be impacted, or the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. This latter event\ncould trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. The Fund could lose money if its short-\nterm investment of the collateral declines in\nvalue over the period of the loan. Substitute\npayments received by the Fund representing\ndividends paid on securities loaned out by the\nFund will not be considered qualified dividend\nincome. BTC will take into account the tax\neffects on shareholders caused by this\ndifference in connection with the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to the Fund (as permitted by\napplicable law). Regulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require certain bank-\nregulated counterparties and certain of their\naffiliates to include in certain financial\ncontracts, including many securities lending\nagreements, terms that delay or restrict the\nrights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to\nterminate such agreements, foreclose upon\ncollateral, exercise other default rights or\nrestrict transfers of credit support in the\nevent that the counterparty and/or its\naffiliates are subject to certain types of\nresolution or insolvency proceedings. It is\npossible that these requirements, as well as\npotential additional government regulation and\nother developments in the market, could\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to\nterminate existing securities lending\nagreements or to realize amounts to be\nreceived under such agreements. Liquidity Risk\nManagement. Rule 22e-4 under the Investment\nCompany Act (the \u201c Liquidity Rule \u201d ) requires\nopen-end funds, including exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) such as the Fund, to\nestablish a liquidity risk management program\n(the \u201c Liquidity Program \u201d ) and enhance\ndisclosures regarding fund liquidity. As\nrequired by the Liquidity Rule, the Fund has\nimplemented a Liquidity Program, and the\nBoard, including a majority of the Independent\nTrustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as\nthe administrator of the Liquidity Program.\nUnder the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses,\nmanages, and periodically reviews the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk and classifies each investment\nheld by the Fund as a \u201c highly liquid\ninvestment, \u201d \u201c moderately liquid investment,\n\u201d \u201c less liquid investment \u201d or \u201c illiquid\ninvestment. \u201d The Liquidity Rule defines \u201c\nliquidity risk \u201d as the risk that the Fund\ncould not meet requests to redeem shares\nissued by the Fund without significant\ndilution of the remaining investors\u2019 interest\nin the Fund. The liquidity of the Fund's\nportfolio investments is determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment-\nspecific considerations under the Liquidity\nProgram. There are exclusions from certain\nportions of the liquidity risk management\nprogram requirements for \u201c in-kind \u201d ETFs, as\ndefined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent\nthat an investment is deemed to be an illiquid\ninvestment or a less liquid investment, the\nFund can expect to be exposed to greater\nliquidity risk. Non-U.S. Securities. The Fund\nmay purchase publicly traded common stocks of\nnon-U.S. issuers. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, the\nFund's investment in such stocks may be in the\nform of American Depositary Receipts ( \u201c ADRs\n\u201d ), Global Depositary Receipts ( \u201c GDRs \u201d )\nand European Depositary Receipts ( \u201c EDRs \u201d )\n(collectively, \u201c depositary receipts \u201d ).\nDepositary receipts are receipts, typically\nissued by a bank or trust issuer, which\nevidence ownership of underlying securities\nissued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary\nreceipts may not necessarily be denominated in\nthe same currency as their underlying\nsecurities. ADRs typically are issued by a\nU.S. bank or trust company and evidence\nownership of underlying securities issued by a\nnon-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes\nreferred to as continental depositary\nreceipts, are receipts issued in Europe,\ntypically by foreign banks and trust\ncompanies, that evidence ownership of either\nforeign or domestic underlying securities.\nGDRs are depositary receipts structured like\nglobal debt issues to facilitate trading on an\ninternational basis. Generally, ADRs, issued\nin registered form, are designed for use in\nthe U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued\nin bearer form, are designed for use in\nEuropean securities markets. GDRs are tradable\nboth in the U.S. and in Europe and are\ndesigned for use throughout the world.\nDepositary receipts are generally subject to\nthe same risks as the foreign securities that\nthey evidence or into which they may be\nconverted. In addition to investment risks\nassociated with the underlying issuer,\ndepositary receipts expose the Fund to\nadditional risks associated with the non-\nuniform terms that apply to depositary receipt\nprograms, credit exposure to the depository\nbank and to the sponsors and other parties\nwith whom the depository bank establishes the\nprograms, currency risk and liquidity risk.\nUnsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned\nby the issuer of the underlying common stock,\ngenerally expose investors to greater risks\nthan sponsored programs and do not provide\nholders with many of the shareholder benefits\nthat come from investing in a sponsored\ndepositary receipts. Investing in the\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers involves\nspecial risks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in U.S. issuers.\nThese include differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards;\nthe possibility of\n\n5\n\nexpropriation or confiscatory taxation;\nadverse changes in investment or exchange\ncontrol regulations; political instability,\nwhich could affect U.S. investments in\nnon-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions\non the flow of international capital. Non-U.S.\nissuers may be subject to less governmental\nregulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover,\nindividual non-U.S. economies may differ\nfavorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy\nin such respects as growth of gross domestic\nproduct ( \u201c GDP \u201d ), rate of inflation,\ncapital reinvestment, resource self-\nsufficiency and balance of payment positions.\nRegulation Regarding Derivatives. The CFTC\nsubjects advisers to registered investment\ncompanies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund\nthat is advised by the adviser either (i)\ninvests, directly or indirectly, more than a\nprescribed level of its liquidation value in\nCFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps ( \u201c\nCFTC Derivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent the Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. BFA is not, therefore,\nsubject to registration or regulation as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. The Fund (the \u201c No-Action\nLetter Fund \u201d ) may also have investments in \u201c\nunderlying funds \u201d (and such underlying funds\nthemselves may invest in underlying funds) not\nadvised by BFA (the term \u201c underlying fund \u201d\nfor purposes of the no-action letter\nreferenced below may include, but is not\nlimited to, certain securitized vehicles,\nmortgage or international real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ), business\ndevelopment companies and, investment\ncompanies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives\nor in any of the foregoing), and therefore may\nbe viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA\nmay not have transparency into the holdings of\nthese underlying funds because they are not\nadvised by BFA. To address this issue of lack\nof transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-\naction letter on November 29, 2012 permitting\nthe adviser of a fund that invests in such\nunderlying funds and that would otherwise have\nfiled a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC\nRule 4.5 to delay registration as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d until six months\nfrom the date on which the CFTC issues\nadditional guidance on the treatment of CFTC\nDerivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the\nadviser of the No-Action Letter Fund, expects\nto file a claim with the CFTC for the Fund to\nrely on this no-action relief. Assuming the\nCFTC does not reject such claim, BFA should\nnot be subject to registration or regulation\nas a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA\nin respect of the Fund. Derivative contracts,\nincluding, without limitation, swaps, currency\nforwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are\nsubject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n( \u201c Dodd-Frank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under\ncomparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable\nforwards and certain other derivatives traded\nin the OTC market are subject to variation\nmargin and initial margin requirements.\nImplementation of the margining and other\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding\nclearing, mandatory trading, reporting and\ndocumentation of swaps and other derivatives\nhave impacted and may continue to impact the\ncosts to the Fund of trading these instruments\nand, as a result, may affect returns to\ninvestors in the Fund. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits the Fund to\nenter into Derivatives Transactions (as\ndefined below) and certain other transactions\nnotwithstanding the restrictions on the\nissuance of \u201c senior securities \u201d under\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act.\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act,\namong other things, prohibits open-end funds,\nincluding the Fund, from issuing or selling\nany \u201c senior security, \u201d other than borrowing\nfrom a bank (subject to a requirement to\nmaintain 300% \u201c asset coverage \u201d ). Under Rule\n18f-4, \u201c Derivatives Transactions \u201d include\nthe following: (1) any swap, security-based\nswap (including a contract for differences),\nfutures contract, forward contract, option\n(excluding purchased options), any combination\nof the foregoing, or any similar instrument,\nunder which the Fund is or may be required to\nmake any payment or delivery of cash or other\nassets during the life of the instrument or at\nmaturity or early termination, whether as\nmargin or settlement payment or otherwise; (2)\nany short sale borrowing; (3) reverse\nrepurchase agreements and similar financing\ntransactions ( e.g ., recourse and non-\nrecourse tender option bonds, and borrowed\nbonds), if the Fund elects to treat these\ntransactions as Derivatives Transactions under\nRule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-\nsettling securities ( e.g. , firm and standby\ncommitments, including to-be-announced ( \u201c TBA\n\u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-\nstandard settlement cycle securities, unless\nthe Fund intends to physically settle the\ntransaction and the transaction will settle\nwithin 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\n\n6\n\nUnless the Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires the Fund\nto adopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if the Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Repurchase\nAgreements. A repurchase agreement is an\ninstrument under which the purchaser ( i.e. ,\nthe Fund) acquires a security and the seller\nagrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase\nthe security at a mutually agreed-upon time\nand price, thereby determining the yield\nduring the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by the Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Fund may suffer\ntime delays and incur costs or losses in\nconnection with the disposition of the\ncollateral. In any repurchase transaction, the\ncollateral for a repurchase agreement may\ninclude: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations\nissued by the U.S. government or its agencies\nor instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations\nthat, at the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for\nthe Fund, should it decide to utilize them.\nSuch risks are not unique to the Fund, but are\ninherent in repurchase agreements. The Fund\nseeks to minimize such risks, but because of\nthe inherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, the Fund\nwould likely retain the status of an unsecured\ncreditor of the counterparty ( i.e. , the\nposition the Fund would normally be in if it\nwere to hold, pursuant to its investment\npolicies, other unsecured debt securities of\nthe defaulting counterparty) with respect to\nthe amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured\ncreditor, the Fund would be at risk of losing\nsome or all of the principal and income\ninvolved in the transaction. Reverse\nRepurchase Agreements. Reverse repurchase\nagreements involve the sale of securities with\nan agreement to repurchase the securities at\nan agreed-upon price, date and interest\npayment and have the characteristics of\nborrowing. Generally, the effect of such\ntransactions is that the Fund can recover all\nor most of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are advantageous\nonly if the Fund has an opportunity to earn a\nrate of interest on the cash derived from\nthese transactions that is greater than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available, and the Fund intends to\nuse the reverse repurchase technique only when\nBFA believes it will be advantageous to the\nFund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements\nmay exaggerate any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s assets. The use of reverse\nrepurchase agreements is a form of leverage,\nand the proceeds obtained by the Fund through\nreverse repurchase agreements may be invested\nin additional securities. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits the Fund to\nenter into reverse repurchase agreements and\nsimilar financing transactions ( e.g.,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nborrowed bonds) notwithstanding the limitation\non the issuance of senior securities in\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act,\nprovided that the Fund either (i) complies\nwith the 300% asset coverage ratio with\nrespect to such transactions and any other\nborrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treats\nsuch transactions as Derivatives Transactions\nunder Rule 18f-4. (See \u201c Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives \u201d above.)\n\n7\n\nSecurities of Investment Companies. The Fund\nmay invest in the securities of other\ninvestment companies (including money market\nfunds) to the extent permitted by law.\nPursuant to the 1940 Act, the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment in registered investment companies\nis generally limited to, subject to certain\nexceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of any one investment company;\n(ii) 5% of the Fund\u2019s total assets with\nrespect to any one investment company; and\n(iii) 10% of the Fund\u2019s total assets with\nrespect to investment companies in the\naggregate. Other investment companies in which\nthe Fund may invest can be expected to incur\nfees and expenses for operations, such as\ninvestment advisory and administration fees,\nwhich would be in addition to those incurred\nby the Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by\nthe SEC staff, fees and expenses of money\nmarket funds used for cash collateral received\nin connection with loans of securities are not\ntreated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nwhich reflect the Fund\u2019s pro rata share of the\nfees and expenses incurred by investing in\nother investment companies (as disclosed in\nthe Prospectus, as applicable). Short-Term\nInstruments and Temporary Investments. The\nFund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, on an\nongoing basis to provide liquidity or for\nother reasons. Money market instruments are\ngenerally short-term investments that may\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) shares of\nmoney market funds (including those advised by\nBFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c\nCDs \u201d ), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed-time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nnon-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches)\nand similar institutions; (iv) commercial\npaper rated, at the date of purchase, \u201c\nPrime-1 \u201d by Moody's \u00ae Investors Service,\nInc., \u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch Ratings, Inc., or \u201c A-1\n\u201d by Standard & Poor's \u00ae Global Ratings, a\nsubsidiary of S&P Global, Inc., or if unrated,\nof comparable quality as determined by BFA;\n(v) non-convertible corporate debt securities\n( e.g. , bonds and debentures) with remaining\nmaturities at the date of purchase of not more\nthan 397 days and that have been determined to\npresent minimal credit risks, in accordance\nwith the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7\nunder the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase\nagreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-\ndenominated obligations of non-U.S. banks\n(including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion\nof BFA, are of comparable quality to\nobligations of U.S. banks that may be\npurchased by the Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions. Swap Agreements.\nSwap agreements are contracts between parties\nin which one party agrees to make periodic\npayments to the other party based on a pre-\ndetermined underlying investment or notional\namount. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the first party\nbased on the return (or a differential in rate\nof return) earned or realized on the\nunderlying investment or notional amount. Swap\nagreements will usually be performed on a net\nbasis, with the Fund receiving or paying only\nthe net amount of the two payments. The net\namount of the excess, if any, of the Fund\u2019s\nobligations over its entitlements with respect\nto each swap is accrued on a daily basis. The\nuse of swaps is a highly specialized activity\nthat involves investment techniques and risks\ndifferent from those associated with ordinary\nportfolio security transactions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets. Tracking Stocks. A tracking stock is a\nseparate class of common stock whose value is\nlinked to a specific business unit or\noperating division within a larger company and\nis designed to \u201c track \u201d the performance of\nsuch business unit or division. The tracking\nstock may pay dividends to shareholders\nindependent of the parent company. The parent\ncompany, rather than the business unit or\ndivision, generally is the issuer of tracking\nstock. However, holders of the tracking stock\nmay not have the same rights as holders of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock. Future Developments.\nThe Board may, in the future, authorize the\nFund to invest in securities contracts and\ninvestments, other than those listed in this\nSAI and in the Prospectus, provided they are\nconsistent with the Fund's investment\nobjective and do not violate any of its\ninvestment restrictions or policies. General\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of some\nof the principal risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. An investment in the Fund should\nbe made with an understanding that the value\nof the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of stocks in\n\n8\n\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause the Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. Borrowing may cause the Fund to\nliquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy its\nobligations. Commodities Investment Risk.\nExposure to commodities markets may subject\nthe Fund to greater volatility than\ninvestments in traditional securities. The\ncommodities markets have experienced periods\nof extreme volatility. Similar future market\nconditions may result in rapid and substantial\nvaluation increases or decreases in the Fund\u2019s\nholdings. The commodities markets may\nfluctuate widely based on a variety of\nfactors. Movements in commodity investment\nprices are outside of the Fund's control and\nmay not be anticipated by BFA. Price movements\nmay be influenced by, among other things:\ngovernmental, agricultural, trade, fiscal,\nmonetary and exchange control programs and\npolicies; changing market and economic\nconditions; market liquidity; weather and\nclimate conditions, including droughts and\nfloods; livestock disease; changing supply and\ndemand relationships and levels of domestic\nproduction and imported commodities; changes\nin storage costs; the availability of local,\nintrastate and interstate transportation\nsystems; energy conservation; the success of\nexploration projects; changes in international\nbalances of payments and trade; domestic and\nforeign rates of inflation; currency\ndevaluations and revaluations; domestic and\nforeign political and economic events;\ndomestic and foreign interest rates and/or\ninvestor expectations concerning interest\nrates; foreign currency/exchange rates;\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation\nand taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other\npolitical upheaval and conflicts; governmental\nexpropriation; investment and trading\nactivities of mutual funds, hedge funds and\ncommodities funds; and changes in philosophies\nand emotions of market participants. The\nfrequency and magnitude of such changes cannot\nbe predicted. The prices of commodities can\nalso fluctuate widely due to supply and demand\ndisruptions in major producing or consuming\nregions. Certain commodities or natural\nresources may be produced in a limited number\nof countries and may be controlled by a small\nnumber of producers or groups of producers. As\na result, political, economic, regulatory and\nsupply-related events in such countries could\nhave a disproportionate impact on the prices\nof such commodities. A decrease in the\nproduction of a physical commodity or a\ndecrease in the volume of such commodity\navailable for transportation, mining,\nprocessing, storage or distribution may\nadversely impact the financial performance of\na commodity or commodity-related company that\ndevotes a portion of its business to that\ncommodity. Production declines and volume\ndecreases could be caused by various factors,\nincluding catastrophic events affecting\nproduction, depletion of resources, labor\ndifficulties, environmental proceedings,\nincreased regulations, equipment failures and\nunexpected maintenance problems, import supply\ndisruption, governmental expropriation,\npolitical upheaval or conflicts or increased\ncompetition from alternative energy sources or\ncommodity prices. Agricultural commodities may\nbe adversely affected by weather or other\nnatural phenomena, such as drought, floods and\npests. A sustained decline in demand for such\ncommodities could also adversely affect the\nfinancial performance of commodity-related\ncompanies. Factors that could lead to a\ndecline in demand include economic recession\nor other adverse economic conditions, higher\ntaxes on commodities or increased governmental\nregulations, increases in fuel economy,\nconsumer shifts to the use of alternative\ncommodities or fuel sources, changes in\ncommodity prices, or weather. The commodity\nmarkets are subject to temporary distortions\nand other disruptions due to, among other\nfactors, lack of liquidity, the participation\nof speculators, and government regulation and\nother actions. U.S. futures exchanges and some\nforeign exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation in futures contract prices which\nmay occur in a single business day (generally\nreferred to as \u201c daily price fluctuation\nlimits \u201d ). The maximum or minimum price of a\ncontract as a result of these limits is\nreferred to as a \u201c limit price. \u201d If the limit\nprice has been reached in a particular\ncontract, no trades may be made beyond the\nlimit price. Limit prices have the effect of\nprecluding trading in a particular contract or\nforcing the liquidation of contracts at\ndisadvantageous times or prices. Currency\nRisk. Because the Fund's NAV is determined on\nthe basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may\nlose money if the currency of a non-U.S.\nmarket in which the Fund invests depreciates\nagainst the U.S. dollar, even if the local\ncurrency value of the Fund\u2019s holdings in that\nmarket increases. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency loses value because the currency is\nworth fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, when the\nU.S.\n\n9\n\ndollar decreases in value against a foreign\ncurrency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency gains value because the currency is\nworth more U.S. dollars. This risk, generally\nknown as \u201c currency risk, \u201d means that a\nstrong U.S. dollar will reduce returns for\nU.S. investors, while a weak U.S. dollar will\nincrease those returns. Foreign exchange\ntransactions involve a significant degree of\nrisk and the markets in which foreign exchange\ntransactions are effected are highly volatile,\nhighly specialized and highly technical.\nSignificant changes, including changes in\nliquidity and prices, can occur in such\nmarkets within very short periods of time,\noften within minutes. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the Fund\u2019s performance\nand may lower the Fund\u2019s return. The Fund\ncould experience losses if the value of its\ncurrency forward positions are poorly\ncorrelated with its other investments or if it\ncannot close out its positions because of an\nilliquid market. In addition, the Fund could\nincur transaction costs, including trading\ncommissions, in connection with certain\nnon-U.S. currency transactions. Custody Risk.\nCustody risk refers to the risks inherent in\nthe process of clearing and settling trades\nand to the holding of securities, cash and\nother assets by local banks, agents and\ndepositories. Low trading volumes and volatile\nprices in less developed markets make trades\nharder to complete and settle, and governments\nor trade groups may compel local agents to\nhold securities in designated depositories\nthat may not be subject to independent\nevaluation. Local agents are held only to the\nstandards of care of their local markets, and\nthus may be subject to limited or no\ngovernment oversight. Communications between\nthe U.S. and emerging market countries may be\nunreliable, increasing the risk of delayed\nsettlements or losses of security\ncertificates. In general, the less developed a\ncountry\u2019s securities market is, the greater\nthe likelihood of custody problems. Practices\nin relation to the settlement of securities\ntransactions in emerging markets involve\nhigher risks than those in developed markets,\nin part because of the use of brokers and\ncounterparties that are often less well\ncapitalized, and custody and registration of\nassets in some countries may be unreliable.\nThe possibility of fraud, negligence or undue\ninfluence being exerted by the issuer or\nrefusal to recognize ownership exists in some\nemerging markets, and, along with other\nfactors, could result in ownership\nregistration being lost. In addition, the laws\nof certain countries may put limits on the\nFund\u2019s ability to recover its assets if a\nforeign bank or depository or issuer of a\nsecurity or an agent of any of the foregoing\ngoes bankrupt. The Fund would absorb any loss\nresulting from such custody problems and may\nhave no successful claim for compensation.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. The Fund may not\nacquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, the Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that the Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nThe liquidity of an investment will be\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment specific considerations as set\nout in the Liquidity Program as required by\nthe Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may\ntrade at a discount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and the Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of the Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Money Market\nInstruments Risk. The Fund may hold money\nmarket instruments. The value of money market\ninstruments may be affected by changes in\ninterest rates or in the credit ratings of the\ninvestments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of a Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. It is possible to\nlose money by investing in a money market\nfund. Money market funds other than U.S.\ngovernment money market funds and retail money\nmarket funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV instead of\nusing a stable $1.00 per share price.\nOperational Risk. BFA and the Fund's other\nservice providers may experience disruptions\nor operating errors such as processing errors\nor human errors, inadequate or failed internal\nor external processes, or systems or\ntechnology failures, that could negatively\nimpact the Fund. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from the Fund\u2019s in the setting of\npriorities, the personnel and resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. BFA, through its monitoring and\noversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect\nthe Fund or to develop processes and controls\nto completely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects.\n\n10\n\nReference Rate Replacement Risk. The Fund may\nbe exposed to financial instruments that\nrecently transitioned from, or continue to be\ntied to, the London Interbank Offered Rate ( \u201c\nLIBOR \u201d ) to determine payment obligations,\nfinancing terms, hedging strategies or\ninvestment value. The United Kingdom\u2019s\nFinancial Conduct Authority ( \u201c FCA \u201d ), which\nregulates LIBOR, has ceased publishing all\nLIBOR settings. In April 2023, however, the\nFCA announced that some USD LIBOR settings\nwill continue to be published under a\nsynthetic methodology until September 30, 2024\nfor certain legacy contracts. The Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which\nis a broad measure of the cost of borrowing\ncash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities in the repurchase agreement market,\nhas been used increasingly on a voluntary\nbasis in new instruments and transactions.\nUnder U.S. regulations that implement a\nstatutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR,\nbenchmark rates based on SOFR have replaced\nLIBOR in different categories of financial\ncontracts. Neither the effect of the LIBOR\ntransition process nor its ultimate success\ncan yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-\nbased instruments may contemplate a scenario\nwhere LIBOR is no longer available by\nproviding for an alternative rate-setting\nmethodology, there may be significant\nuncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any\nsuch alternative methodologies to replicate\nLIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may have alternative rate-setting\nprovisions and there remains uncertainty\nregarding the willingness and ability of\nissuers to add alternative rate-setting\nprovisions in certain existing instruments.\nParties to contracts, securities, or other\ninstruments using LIBOR may disagree on\ntransition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. The Fund may have\ninstruments linked to other interbank offered\nrates that may also cease to be published in\nthe future. Risk of Derivatives. A derivative\nis a financial contract, the value of which\ndepends on, or is derived from, the value of\nan underlying asset, such as a security, a\ncommodity (such as gold or silver), a currency\nor an index (a measure of value or rates, such\nas the S&P 500 \u00ae or the prime lending rate).\nThe Fund may invest in futures contracts,\nsecurities options and other derivatives.\nCompared to securities, derivatives can be\nmore sensitive to changes in interest rates or\nto sudden fluctuations in market prices and\nthus the Fund\u2019s losses may be greater if it\ninvests in derivatives than if it invests only\nin conventional securities. Derivatives are\nalso subject to counterparty risk, which is\nthe risk that the other party in the\ntransaction will not fulfill its contractual\nobligations. Derivatives generally involve the\nincurrence of leverage. When a derivative is\nused as a hedge against a position that the\nFund holds or is committed to purchase, any\nloss generated by the derivative generally\nshould be substantially offset by gains on the\nhedged investment, and vice versa. While\nhedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can\nalso reduce or eliminate gains and, in some\ncases, hedging can cause losses that are not\noffset by gains, and the Fund will recognize\nlosses on both the investment and the hedge.\nHedges are sometimes subject to imperfect\nmatching between the derivative and the\nunderlying security, and there can be no\nassurance that the Fund's hedging\ntransactions, which entail additional\ntransaction costs, will be effective. Risk of\nEquity Securities. An investment in the Fund\nshould be made with an understanding of the\nrisks inherent in an investment in equity\nsecurities, including the risk that the\nfinancial condition of issuers may become\nimpaired or that the general condition of\nstock markets may deteriorate (either of which\nmay cause a decrease in the value of the\nportfolio securities and thus in the value of\nshares of the Fund). Common stocks are\nsusceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations and to increases and decreases in\nvalue as market confidence and perceptions of\ntheir issuers change. These investor\nperceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Common stocks may experience extreme\nprice volatility due to actions taken by\nparticular investors or groups of investors\n(for example, retail investors influenced by\nsocial media activity or other media coverage\nor significant \u201c short \u201d positions taken by\ninstitutional investors). Holders of common\nstocks incur more risks than holders of\npreferred stocks and debt obligations because\ncommon stockholders generally have rights to\nreceive payments from stock issuers that are\ninferior to the rights of creditors, or\nholders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (the value of which,\nhowever, is subject to market fluctuations\nprior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stocks have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity date. In addition, issuers may, in\ntimes of distress or at their own discretion,\ndecide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which\nmay also cause their stock price to decline.\nAlthough most of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index are listed on a securities\nexchange, the principal trading market for\nsome of the securities may be in the OTC\nmarket. The existence of a liquid trading\nmarket for certain securities may depend on\nwhether dealers will make a market in such\nsecurities. There can be no assurance that a\nmarket will be made or\n\n11\n\nmaintained or that any such market will be or\nremain liquid. The price at which securities\nmay be sold and the value of the Fund\u2019s shares\nwill be adversely affected if trading markets\nfor the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities are\nlimited or absent, or if bid/ask spreads are\nwide. Risk of Futures and Options on Futures\nTransactions. There are several risks\naccompanying the utilization of futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts. A\nposition in futures contracts and options on\nfutures contracts may be closed only on the\nexchange on which the contract was made (or a\nlinked exchange). While the Fund plans to\nutilize futures contracts only if an active\nmarket exists for such contracts, there is no\nguarantee that a liquid market will exist for\nthe contract at a specified time. Futures\ncontracts, by definition, project price levels\nin the future and not current levels of\nvaluation; therefore, market circumstances may\nresult in a discrepancy between the price of\nthe future and the movement in the Fund's\nUnderlying Index. In the event of adverse\nprice movements, the Fund would continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if the Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, the Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, intends to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit the risk exposure to levels\ncomparable to a direct investment in the types\nof stocks in which it invests. Utilization of\nfutures and options on futures by the Fund\ninvolves the risk of imperfect or even\nnegative correlation to the Underlying Index\nif the index underlying the futures contract\ndiffers from the Underlying Index. There is\nalso the risk of loss of margin deposits in\nthe event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom\nthe Fund has an open position in the futures\ncontract or option. The purchase of put or\ncall options will be based upon predictions by\nBFA as to anticipated trends, which\npredictions could prove to be incorrect.\nBecause the futures market generally imposes\nless burdensome margin requirements than the\nsecurities market, an increased amount of\nparticipation by speculators in the futures\nmarket could result in price fluctuations.\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day.\nThe daily limit establishes the maximum amount\nby which the price of a futures contract may\nvary either up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting the Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, the Fund\nwould be required to make daily cash payments\nof variation margin. Risk of Investing in\nNon-U.S. Equity Securities. An investment in\nthe Fund involves risks similar to those of\ninvesting in portfolios of equity securities\ntraded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks\ninclude market fluctuations caused by such\nfactors as economic and political developments\nin those foreign countries, changes in\ninterest rates and perceived trends in stock\nprices. Investing in securities issued by\nissuers domiciled in countries other than the\ndomicile of the investor and denominated in\ncurrencies other than an investor\u2019s local\ncurrency entails certain considerations and\nrisks not typically encountered by the\ninvestor in making investments in its home\ncountry and in that country\u2019s currency. These\nconsiderations include favorable or\nunfavorable changes in interest rates,\ncurrency exchange rates, exchange control\nregulations and the costs that may be incurred\nin connection with conversions between various\ncurrencies. Investing in the Fund also\ninvolves certain risks and considerations not\ntypically associated with investing in a fund\nwhose portfolio contains exclusively\nsecurities of U.S. issuers. These risks\ninclude generally less liquid and less\nefficient securities markets; generally\ngreater price volatility; less publicly\navailable information about issuers; the\nimposition of withholding or other taxes; the\nimposition of restrictions on the expatriation\nof funds or other assets of the Fund; higher\ntransaction and custody costs; delays and\nrisks attendant in settlement procedures;\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual\nobligations; lower liquidity and significantly\nsmaller market capitalization; different\naccounting and disclosure standards; lower\nlevels of regulation of the securities\nmarkets; more substantial government\ninterference with the economy and businesses;\nhigher rates of inflation; greater social,\neconomic, and political uncertainty; the risk\nof nationalization or expropriation of assets;\nand the risk of war.\n\n12\n\nRisk of Swap Agreements. The risk of loss with\nrespect to swaps is generally limited to the\nnet amount of payments that the Fund is\ncontractually obligated to make. Swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nswap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, the\nparties will have contractual remedies\npursuant to the agreements related to the\ntransaction. However, such remedies may be\nsubject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws,\nwhich could affect the Fund\u2019s rights as a\ncreditor ( e.g. , the Fund may not receive the\nnet amount of payments that it is\ncontractually entitled to receive). The Fund\nis required to post and collect variation\nmargin and initial margin (comprised of\nspecified liquid securities subject to\nhaircuts) in connection with trading of OTC\nswaps. These requirements may raise the costs\nfor the Fund\u2019s investment in swaps. Tracking\nError Risk. The Fund may be subject to\ntracking error, which is the divergence of the\nFund\u2019s performance from that of the Underlying\nIndex. Tracking error may occur because of\ndifferences between the securities and other\ninstruments held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in the Underlying Index,\npricing differences, transaction costs\nincurred by the Fund, the Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in timing of the\naccrual of or the valuation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or distributions\npaid to the Fund\u2019s shareholders, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions carried out\nto minimize the distribution of capital gains\nto shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the Underlying Index or the costs\nto the Fund of complying with various new or\nexisting regulatory requirements. This risk\nmay be heightened during times of increased\nmarket volatility or other unusual market\nconditions. Tracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and expenses,\nwhile the Underlying Index does not. Tracking\nerror may occur due to differences between the\nmethodologies used in calculating the value of\nthe Underlying Index and determining the\nFund\u2019s NAV. When an issuer is introduced by an\nindex provider into an index tracked by a\nFund, BFA may conduct an analysis on such\nissuer\u2019s securities to identify and screen for\noutlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or\nunusual price growth that does not appear to\nbe supported by publicly available information\non the business and assets of the issuer,\nunusual or significant short interest or\nlending activity, negative sentiment,\nsuspended trading or incorrect free-float\ncalculations, which could be indicators of\npossible irregularities, miscalculations or\neven fraud). If it identifies such behavior,\nBFA may, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the\nrebalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from a\nFund\u2019s portfolio and, if it does so, such Fund\nwill be subject to increased tracking error\ndue to the divergence in the securities\nincluded in its portfolio from its underlying\nindex. BFA\u2019s underweighting or excluding such\nsecurities may result in a decline in the\nFund\u2019s net asset value. The application of the\nabovementioned analysis and screening to a\nFund and its Underlying Index is in the sole\ndiscretion of BFA and its affiliates (without\nany guarantees). The analysis and screening\nmay not exclude any or all high risk\nsecurities from an Underlying Index or a\nFund\u2019s portfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\nthe Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more such\nsecurities declines in value. Volatility Risk.\nThe value of a security may fluctuate due to\nfactors affecting markets generally or\nparticular industries. This volatility may\naffect the Fund's NAV. Securities in the the\nFund's portfolio may be subject to price\nvolatility and their prices may not be any\nless volatile than the market as a whole and\ncould be more volatile. Events or financial\ncircumstances affecting individual securities\nor sectors may increase the volatility of the\nFund. Risk of Investing in Africa. Investments\nin securities of issuers in certain African\ncountries involve heightened risks including,\namong others, expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, political instability, including\nauthoritarian and/or military involvement in\ngovernmental decision-making, armed conflict,\ncivil war, and social instability as a result\nof religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic\nunrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and,\nin certain countries, genocidal warfare.\nCertain countries in Africa generally have\nless developed capital markets than\ntraditional emerging market countries, and,\nconsequently, the risks of investing in\nforeign securities are magnified in such\ncountries. Because securities markets of\ncountries in Africa are generally\nunderdeveloped and are generally less\ncorrelated to global economic cycles than\nthose markets located in more developed\ncountries, securities markets in African\ncountries are subject to greater risks\nassociated with market volatility, lower\nmarket capitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations and uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets. Moreover,\ntrading on African securities markets may be\nsuspended altogether.\n\n13\n\nMarket volatility may also be heightened by\nthe actions of a small number of investors.\nBrokerage firms in certain countries in Africa\nmay be fewer in number and less established\nthan brokerage firms in more developed\nmarkets. Since the Fund may need to effect\nsecurities transactions through these\nbrokerage firms, the Fund is subject to the\nrisk that these brokerage firms will not be\nable to fulfill their obligations to the Fund\n( i.e., counterparty risk). This risk is\nmagnified to the extent that the Fund effects\nsecurities transactions through a single\nbrokerage firm or a small number of brokerage\nfirms. Certain governments in African\ncountries restrict or control to varying\ndegrees the ability of foreign investors to\ninvest in securities of issuers located or\noperating in those countries. Moreover,\ncertain countries in Africa require\ngovernmental approval or special licenses\nprior to investment by foreign investors and\nmay limit the amount of investment by foreign\ninvestors in a particular industry and/or\nissuer, and may limit such foreign investment\nto a certain class of securities of an issuer\nthat may have less advantageous rights than\nthe classes available for purchase by domestic\ninvestors of the countries and/or impose\nadditional taxes on foreign investors. A delay\nin obtaining a government approval or a\nlicense would delay investments in a\nparticular country, and, as a result, the Fund\nmay not be able to invest in certain\nsecurities while approval is pending. The\ngovernment of a particular country may also\nwithdraw or decline to renew a license that\nenables the Fund to invest in such country.\nThese factors make investing in issuers\nlocated or operating in countries in Africa\nsignificantly riskier than investing in\nissuers located or operating in more developed\ncountries, and any one of these factors could\ncause a decline in the value of the Fund\ninvestments. Issuers located or operating in\ncountries in Africa are generally not subject\nto the same rules and regulations as issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\ncountries. Therefore, there may be less\nfinancial and other information publicly\navailable with regard to issuers located or\noperating in countries in Africa and such\nissuers are generally not subject to the\nuniform accounting, auditing and financial\nreporting standards applicable to issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\ncountries. In addition, governments of certain\ncountries in Africa in which the Fund may\ninvest may levy withholding or other taxes on\nincome such as dividends, interest and\nrealized capital gains. Although in certain\ncountries in Africa a portion of these taxes\nare recoverable, the non-recovered portion of\nforeign withholding taxes will reduce the\nincome received from investments in such\ncountries. Investment in countries in Africa\nmay be subject to a greater degree of risk\nassociated with governmental approval in\nconnection with the repatriation of investment\nincome, capital or the proceeds of sales of\nsecurities by foreign investors. In addition,\nthere is the risk that if an African country\u2019s\nbalance of payments declines, such African\ncountry may impose temporary restrictions on\nforeign capital remittances. Consequently, the\nFund could be adversely affected by delays in,\nor a refusal to grant, required governmental\napproval for repatriation of capital, as well\nas by the application to the Fund of any\nrestrictions on investments. Additionally,\ninvestments in countries in Africa may require\nthe Fund to adopt special procedures, seek\nlocal government approvals or take other\nactions, each of which may involve additional\ncosts to the Fund. Securities laws in many\ncountries in Africa are relatively new and\nunsettled and, consequently, there is a risk\nof rapid and unpredictable change in laws\nregarding foreign investment, securities\nregulation, title to securities and\nshareholder rights. Accordingly, foreign\ninvestors may be adversely affected by new or\namended laws and regulations. In addition,\nthere may be no single centralized securities\nexchange on which securities are traded in\ncertain countries in Africa and the systems of\ncorporate governance to which issuers located\nin countries in Africa are subject may be less\nadvanced than those systems to which issuers\nlocated in more developed countries are\nsubject, and, therefore, shareholders of\nissuers located in such countries may not\nreceive many of the protections available to\nshareholders of issuers located in more\ndeveloped countries. Even in circumstances\nwhere adequate laws and shareholder rights\nexist, it may not be possible to obtain swift\nand equitable enforcement of the law. In\naddition, the enforcement of systems of\ntaxation at federal, regional and local levels\nin countries in Africa may be inconsistent and\nsubject to sudden change. Certain countries in\nAfrica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. Certain countries in Africa\ndepend to a significant extent upon exports of\nprimary commodities such as gold, silver,\ncopper and diamonds. These countries therefore\nare vulnerable to changes in commodity prices,\nwhich may be affected by a variety of factors.\nIn addition, certain issuers located in\ncountries in Africa in which the Fund invests\nmay operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if\n\n14\n\nit is identified as an issuer which operates\nin, or has dealings with, such countries. The\nFund, as an investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. The\ngovernments of certain countries in Africa may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in such countries, which\ncould have a negative impact on private sector\ncompanies. There is also the possibility of\ndiplomatic developments that could adversely\naffect investments in certain countries in\nAfrica. Some countries in Africa may be\naffected by a greater degree of public\ncorruption and crime, including organized\ncrime. Political instability and protests in\nNorth Africa and the Middle East have caused\nand may in the future cause significant\ndisruptions to many industries. In addition,\nthe outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa\nseverely challenged health care industries in\nthose countries and adversely impacted the\nregion\u2019s economy due to quarantines and\ndisruptions of trade, which has further\nincreased instability in the region. This\ninstability has demonstrated that political\nand social unrest can spread quickly through\nthe region, and that developments in one\ncountry can influence the political events in\nneighboring countries. Some protests have\nturned violent, and civil war and political\nreconstruction in certain countries such as\nLibya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to\ninvestments in the region. Continued political\nand social unrest in these regions, including\nthe ongoing warfare and terrorist activities\nin the Middle East and Africa, may negatively\naffect the value of an investment in the Fund.\nRisk of Investing in Asia. Investments in\nsecurities of issuers in certain Asian\ncountries involve risks not typically\nassociated with investments in securities of\nissuers in other regions. Such heightened\nrisks include, among others, expropriation\nand/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, piracy of intellectual property,\ndata and other security breaches (especially\nof data stored electronically), political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict and social instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-\neconomic unrest. Certain Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid rates of economic growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, and there\nis no assurance that these rates of economic\ngrowth and industrialization will be\nmaintained. Certain Asian countries have\ndemocracies with relatively short histories,\nwhich may increase the risk of political\ninstability. These countries have faced\npolitical and military unrest, and further\nunrest could present a risk to their local\neconomies and securities markets. Indonesia\nand the Philippines have each experienced\nviolence and terrorism, which has negatively\nimpacted their economies. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect Asian issuers that\nrely on the U.S. for trade. Political,\nreligious, and border disputes persist in\nIndia. India has recently experienced and may\ncontinue to experience civil unrest and\nhostilities with certain of its neighboring\ncountries. Increased political and social\nunrest in these geographic areas could\nadversely affect the performance of\ninvestments in this region. Certain\ngovernments in this region administer prices\non several basic goods, including fuel and\nelectricity, within their respective\ncountries. Certain governments may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector in their respective countries\nand may own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in this\nregion, which in turn could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments adversely affecting investments\nin the region. Corruption and the perceived\nlack of a rule of law in dealings with\ninternational companies in certain Asian\ncountries may discourage foreign investment\nand could negatively impact the long-term\ngrowth of certain economies in this region. In\naddition, certain countries in the region are\nexperiencing high unemployment and corruption,\nand have fragile banking sectors. Some\neconomies in this region are dependent on a\nrange of commodities, including oil, natural\ngas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly\naffected by international commodity prices and\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. The market\nfor securities in this region may also be\ndirectly influenced by the flow of\ninternational capital, and by the economic and\nmarket conditions of neighboring countries.\nChina is a key trading partner of many Asian\ncountries and any changes in trading\nrelationships between China and other Asian\ncountries may affect the region as a whole.\nAdverse economic conditions or developments in\nneighboring countries may increase investors'\nperception of the risk of investing in the\nregion as a whole, which may adversely impact\nthe market value of the securities issued by\ncompanies in the region.\n\n15\n\nRisk of Investing in Central and South\nAmerica. The economies of certain countries in\nwhich the Fund invests are affected by the\neconomies of other Central and South American\ncountries, some of which have experienced high\ninterest rates, economic volatility,\ninflation, currency devaluations, government\ndefaults, high unemployment rates and\npolitical instability which can adversely\naffect issuers in these countries. In\naddition, commodities (such as oil, gas and\nminerals) represent a significant percentage\nof exports for the regions and many economies\nin these regions are particularly sensitive to\nfluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse\neconomic events in one country may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on some or all of\nthe countries to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe governments of certain countries in\nCentral and South America may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector and may own or control many\ncompanies. Future government actions could\nhave a significant effect on the economic\nconditions in such countries, which could have\na negative impact on the securities in which a\nFund invests. Diplomatic developments may also\nadversely affect investments in certain\ncountries in Central and South America. Some\ncountries in Central and South America may be\naffected by public corruption and crime,\nincluding organized crime. Certain countries\nin Central and South America may be heavily\ndependent upon international trade and,\nconsequently, have been and may continue to be\nnegatively affected by trade barriers,\nexchange controls, managed adjustments in\nrelative currency values and other\nprotectionist measures imposed or negotiated\nby the countries with which they trade. These\ncountries also have been and may continue to\nbe adversely affected by economic conditions\nin the countries with which they trade. In\naddition, certain issuers located in countries\nin Central and South America in which a Fund\ninvests may be the subject of sanctions (for\nexample, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on\ncertain Venezuelan individuals, corporate\nentities and the Venezuelan government) or\nhave dealings with countries subject to\nsanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S.\ngovernment and the United Nations and/or\ncountries identified by the U.S. government as\nstate sponsors of terrorism. An issuer may\nsustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer that has dealings with\nsuch countries. A Fund may be adversely\naffected if it invests in such issuers. Risk\nof Investing in China. Investments in\nsecurities of companies domiciled in China\ninvolve a high degree of risk and special\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the U.S. securities markets. Such\nheightened risks include, among others, an\nauthoritarian government, popular unrest\nassociated with demands for improved\npolitical, economic and social conditions, the\nimpact of regional conflict on the economy and\nhostile relations with neighboring countries.\nMilitary conflicts, either in response to\ninternal social unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries, could disrupt economic development.\nThe Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-\nrunning disagreements and religious and\nnationalist disputes with Tibet and the\nXinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been\ntensions between the Chinese government and\nmany people in Hong Kong who perceive China as\ntightening control over Hong Kong\u2019s semi-\nautonomous liberal political, economic, legal,\nand social framework. Recent protests and\nunrest have increased tensions even further.\nDue to the interconnected nature of the Hong\nKong and Chinese economies, this instability\nin Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong\nKong and Chinese markets. China has a complex\nterritorial dispute regarding the sovereignty\nof Taiwan and has made threats of invasion.\nTaiwan-based companies and individuals are\nsignificant investors in China. Military\nconflict between China and Taiwan may\nadversely affect securities of Chinese\nissuers. In addition, China has strained\ninternational relations with Japan, India,\nRussia and other neighbors due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities and other\ndefense concerns. Additionally, China is\nalleged to have participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Actual and\nthreatened responses to such activity and\nstrained international relations, including\npurchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. China could be affected by\nmilitary events on the Korean peninsula or\ninternal instability within North Korea. These\nsituations may cause uncertainty in the\nChinese market and may adversely affect the\nperformance of the Chinese economy. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, the Chinese government still\nexercises substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Chinese companies,\nsuch as those in the financial services or\ntechnology sectors, and potentially other\nsectors in the future, are subject to the risk\nthat Chinese authorities can intervene in\ntheir operations and structure. The Chinese\ngovernment continues to maintain a major role\nin economic policymaking. Investing in China\ninvolves risk of loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and on repatriation of\ncapital invested.\n\n16\n\nIn addition, there is less regulation and\nmonitoring of Chinese securities markets and\nthe activities of investors, brokers and other\nparticipants than in the U.S. Accordingly,\nissuers of securities in China, including\nChinese companies that are listed on U.S.\nexchanges, are not subject to the same degree\nof regulation as are U.S. issuers with respect\nto such matters as insider trading rules,\ntender offer regulation, accounting standards\nor auditor oversight, stockholder proxy\nrequirements and the requirements mandating\ntimely and accurate disclosure of information.\nSecurities markets in China are in the process\nof change and further development. This may\nlead to trading volatility, difficulty in the\nsettlement and recording of transactions and\ndifficulty in interpreting and applying the\nrelevant regulation. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund is not\nactively managed and does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. While the Chinese economy has\nexperienced past periods of rapid growth,\nthere is no assurance that such growth rates\nwill recur. China may experience substantial\nrates of inflation, significant indebtedness\nor economic recessions, causing a negative\neffect on the economy and securities market.\nChina\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on export\ngrowth. Reduction in spending on Chinese\nproducts and services, supply chain\ndiversification, institution of additional\ntariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers or\na downturn in any of the economies of China\u2019s\nkey trading partners may have an adverse\nimpact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese\nissuers of securities in which a Fund invests.\nFor example, the U.S. has added certain\nforeign technology companies to the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry\nand Security\u2019s \u201c Entity List, \u201d which is a\nlist of companies believed to pose a national\nsecurity risk to the U.S. Actions like these\nmay have unanticipated and disruptive effects\non the Chinese economy. Any such response that\ntargets Chinese financial markets or\nsecurities exchanges could interfere with\norderly trading, delay settlement or cause\nmarket disruptions. Risk of Investing in\nEastern Europe. Investing in the securities of\nissuers located or operating in Eastern Europe\nis highly speculative and involves risks not\nusually associated with investing in the more\ndeveloped markets of Western Europe. Certain\nEastern European countries have high public\ndebt levels, significant underground\neconomies, high unemployment and emigration of\nskilled workers. Such countries generally have\na history of political instability, limited\ninfrastructure and an inefficient public\nsector prone to endemic corruption. Political\nand economic reforms are too recent to\nestablish a definite trend away from centrally\nplanned economies and state-owned industries.\nIn the past, some Eastern European governments\nhave expropriated substantial amounts of\nprivate property, and many claims of the\nproperty owners have never been fully settled.\nMany Eastern European countries continue to\nmove toward market economies at different\npaces with different characteristics. Many\nEastern European securities markets are\ngenerally underdeveloped with low, irregular\ntrading volumes, dubious investor protections,\nand often a dearth of reliable corporate\ninformation. Eastern European securities\nmarkets are generally subject to less\ngovernment supervision and regulation and may\nbe less liquid and more volatile than\nsecurities markets in the U.S. or Western\nEuropean countries. Legal institutions\ngoverning private and foreign investments and\nprivate property may be relatively nascent,\ninefficient, and unevenly enforced or\ninequitably enforced. Certain Eastern European\ngovernments may exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector and\nmay own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in such\ncountries, which could have a negative impact\non the Fund\u2019s investments. Information and\ntransaction costs, differential taxes, and\nsometimes political or transfer risk give a\ncomparative advantage to the domestic investor\nrather than the foreign investor. Eastern\nEuropean economies may also be particularly\nsusceptible to changes in the international\ncredit markets due to their reliance on bank\nrelated inflows of capital. Changes to the\neconomies of countries with substantial\nforeign direct investment in certain Eastern\nEuropean countries may negatively affect the\nregion\u2019s economy. The economy of certain\nEastern European countries may be adversely\naffected by global prices for manufactured\ngoods or commodity price declines to the\nextent that a country relies on the export of\nsuch products. Geopolitical events, including\nwar, and other instability in certain Eastern\nEuropean countries may cause uncertainty in\nthe region\u2019s financial markets and adversely\naffect the performance of the issuers to which\nthe Fund has exposure. These markets may be\nparticularly sensitive to social, political,\neconomic, and currency events in Russia and\nmay suffer heavy losses as a result of their\ntrading and investment links to the Russian\neconomy and currency. Russia has historically\nasserted its influence in the region using\ndiplomatic, informational, military, and\neconomic instruments of national power, as it\ndid with Georgia in the summer of 2008 and\nUkraine beginning in 2014, and most recently\non February 24, 2022.\n\n17\n\nRussian Invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally. Risk\nof Investing in Emerging Markets. Investments\nin emerging market countries may be subject to\ngreater risks than investments in developed\ncountries. These risks include: (i) less\nsocial, political, and economic stability;\n(ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility\ndue to smaller or limited local capital\nmarkets for such securities, or low or non-\nexistent trading volumes; (iii) companies,\ncustodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges\nand broker-dealers may be subject to less\nscrutiny and regulation by local authorities;\n(iv) local governments may decide to seize or\nconfiscate securities held by foreign\ninvestors and/or local governments may decide\nto suspend or limit an issuer's ability to\nmake dividend or interest payments; (v) local\ngovernments may limit or entirely restrict\nrepatriation of invested capital, profits, and\ndividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject\nto local taxation, including on a retroactive\nbasis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on\nstandard payments imposed by local governments\nmay attempt to make dividend or interest\npayments to foreign investors in the local\ncurrency; (viii) there may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and investors may experience\ndifficulty in enforcing legal claims related\nto the securities and/or local judges may\nfavor the interests of the issuer over those\nof foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments\nmay only be permitted to be paid in the local\ncurrency; (x) limited public information\nregarding the issuer may result in greater\ndifficulty in determining market valuations of\nthe securities; and (xi) lack of financial\nreporting on a regular basis, substandard\ndisclosure and differences in accounting\nstandards may make it difficult to ascertain\nthe financial health of an issuer. The Fund is\nnot actively managed and does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. Emerging market securities\nmarkets are typically marked by a high\nconcentration of market capitalization and\ntrading volume in a small number of issuers\nrepresenting a limited number of industries,\nas well as a high concentration of ownership\nof such securities by a limited number of\ninvestors. In addition, brokerage and other\ncosts associated with transactions in emerging\nmarket securities can be higher, sometimes\nsignificantly, than similar costs incurred in\nsecurities markets in developed countries.\nAlthough some emerging markets have become\nmore established and tend to issue securities\nof higher credit quality, the markets for\nsecurities in other emerging market countries\nare in the earliest stages of their\ndevelopment, and these countries issue\nsecurities across the credit spectrum. Even\nthe markets for relatively widely traded\nsecurities in emerging market countries may\nnot be able to absorb, without price\ndisruptions, a significant increase in trading\nvolume or trades of a size customarily\nundertaken by institutional investors in the\nsecurities markets of developed countries. The\nlimited size of many of these securities\nmarkets can cause prices to be erratic for\nreasons apart from factors that affect the\nsoundness and competitiveness of the\nsecurities issuers. For example, prices may be\nunduly influenced by traders who control large\npositions in these markets. Additionally,\nmarket making and arbitrage activities are\ngenerally less extensive in such markets,\nwhich may contribute to increased volatility\nand reduced liquidity of such markets. The\nlimited liquidity of emerging market country\nsecurities may also affect the Fund's ability\nto accurately value its portfolio securities\nor to acquire or dispose of securities at the\nprice and time it wishes to do so or in order\nto meet redemption requests. Many emerging\nmarket countries suffer from uncertainty and\ncorruption in their legal frameworks.\nLegislation may be difficult to interpret and\nlaws may be too new to provide any\nprecedential value. Laws regarding foreign\ninvestment and private property may be weak or\nnon-existent. Sudden changes in governments\nmay result in policies which are less\nfavorable to investors such as policies\ndesigned to expropriate or nationalize \u201c\nsovereign \u201d assets. Certain emerging market\ncountries in the past have expropriated large\namounts of private property, in many cases\nwith little or no compensation, and there can\nbe no assurance that such expropriation will\nnot occur in the future. Investment in the\nsecurities markets of certain emerging market\ncountries is restricted or controlled to\nvarying degrees. These restrictions may limit\nthe Fund's investment in certain emerging\nmarket countries and may increase the expenses\nof the Fund. Certain emerging market countries\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestments by foreign persons or limit\n\n18\n\ninvestment by foreign persons to only a\nspecified percentage of an issuer's\noutstanding securities or a specific class of\nsecurities which may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\ncompany available for purchase by nationals.\nMany emerging market countries lack the\nsocial, political, and economic stability\ncharacteristic of the U.S. Political\ninstability among emerging market countries\ncan be common and may be caused by an uneven\ndistribution of wealth, social unrest, labor\nstrikes, civil wars, and religious oppression.\nEconomic instability in emerging market\ncountries may take the form of: (i) high\ninterest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation,\nincluding hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of\nunemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes\nin government economic and tax policies,\nincluding confiscatory taxation; and (v)\nimposition of trade barriers. The Fund's\nincome and, in some cases, capital gains from\nforeign securities will be subject to\napplicable taxation in certain of the emerging\nmarket countries in which it invests, and\ntreaties between the U.S. and such countries\nmay not be available in some cases to reduce\nthe otherwise applicable tax rates. Emerging\nmarkets also have different clearance and\nsettlement procedures, and in certain of these\nemerging markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of securities transactions, making\nit difficult to conduct such transactions. In\nthe past, certain governments in emerging\nmarket countries have become overly reliant on\nthe international capital markets and other\nforms of foreign credit to finance large\npublic spending programs, which in the past\nhave caused huge budget deficits. Often,\ninterest payments have become too overwhelming\nfor a government to meet, representing a large\npercentage of total GDP. These foreign\nobligations have become the subject of\npolitical debate and served as fuel for\npolitical parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\nRisk of Investing in the Middle East. Many\nMiddle Eastern countries have little or no\ndemocratic tradition, and the political and\nlegal systems in such countries may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund. Many economies in\nthe Middle East are highly reliant on income\nfrom the sale of oil and natural gas or trade\nwith countries involved in the sale of oil and\nnatural gas, and their economies are therefore\nvulnerable to changes in the market for oil\nand natural gas and foreign currency values.\nAs global demand for oil and natural gas\nfluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may\nbe significantly impacted. In addition, many\nMiddle Eastern governments have exercised and\ncontinue to exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector. In\ncertain cases, a Middle Eastern country\u2019s\ngovernment may own or control many companies,\nincluding some of the largest companies in the\ncountry. Accordingly, governmental actions in\nthe future could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Middle Eastern\ncountries. This could affect private sector\ncompanies and the Fund, as well as the value\nof securities in the Fund's portfolio. Certain\nMiddle Eastern markets are in the earliest\nstages of development. As a result, there may\nbe a high concentration of market\ncapitalization and trading volume in a small\nnumber of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of investors and financial\nintermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern\ncountries typically are fewer in number and\nless capitalized than brokers in the U.S. The\nlegal systems in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries also may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund. For example, the potential liability\nof a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with\nrespect to acts of the corporation generally\nis limited to the amount of the shareholder\u2019s\ninvestment. However, the notion of limited\nliability is less clear in certain Middle\nEastern countries. The Fund therefore may be\nliable in certain Middle Eastern countries for\nthe acts of a corporation in which it invests\nfor an amount greater than its actual\ninvestment in that corporation. Similarly, the\nrights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers\nmay be more limited than those of shareholders\nof a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain or enforce a legal\njudgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some\nMiddle Eastern countries prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on investments in\ntheir capital markets, particularly their\nequity markets, by foreign entities such as\nthe Fund. For example, certain countries may\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestment by foreign persons or limit the\namount of investment by foreign persons in a\nparticular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern\ncountries may also limit investment by foreign\n\n19\n\npersons to only a specific class of securities\nof an issuer that may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\nissuer available for purchase by nationals of\nthe relevant Middle Eastern country. The\nmanner in which foreign investors may invest\nin companies in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries, as well as limitations on those\ninvestments, may have an adverse impact on the\noperations of the Fund. For example, in\ncertain of these countries, the Fund may be\nrequired to invest initially through a local\nbroker or other entity and then have the\nshares that were purchased re-registered in\nthe name of the Fund. Re-registration in some\ninstances may not be possible on a timely\nbasis. This may result in a delay during which\nthe Fund may be denied certain of its rights\nas an investor, including rights as to\ndividends or to be made aware of certain\ncorporate actions. There also may be instances\nwhere the Fund places a purchase order but is\nsubsequently informed, at the time of re-\nregistration, that the permissible allocation\nof the investment to foreign investors has\nalready been filled and, consequently, the\nFund may not be able to invest in the relevant\ncompany. Substantial limitations may exist in\ncertain Middle Eastern countries with respect\nto the Fund\u2019s ability to repatriate investment\nincome or capital gains. The Fund could be\nadversely affected by delays in, or a refusal\nto grant, any required governmental approval\nfor repatriation of capital, as well as by the\napplication to the Fund of any restrictions on\ninvestment. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nmay be heavily dependent upon international\ntrade and, consequently, have been and may\ncontinue to be negatively affected by trade\nbarriers, exchange controls, managed\nadjustments in relative currency values and\nother protectionist measures imposed or\nnegotiated by the countries with which they\ntrade. These countries also have been and may\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by economic\nconditions in the countries with which they\ntrade. In addition, certain issuers located in\nMiddle Eastern countries in which the Fund\ninvests may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer which operates in, or\nhas dealings with, such countries. The Fund,\nas an investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. Certain\nMiddle Eastern countries have strained\nrelations with other Middle Eastern countries\ndue to territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, international alliances, defense\nconcerns or other reasons, which may adversely\naffect the economies of these Middle Eastern\ncountries. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nexperience significant unemployment, as well\nas widespread underemployment. There has also\nbeen a recent increase in recruitment efforts\nand an aggressive push for territorial control\nby terrorist groups in the region, which has\nled to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities.\nWarfare in Syria has spread to surrounding\nareas, including many portions of Iraq and\nTurkey. Such hostilities may continue into the\nfuture or may escalate at any time due to\nethnic, racial, political, religious or\nideological tensions between groups in the\nregion or foreign intervention or lack of\nintervention, among other factors. Risk of\nInvesting in Saudi Arabia. The Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index includes Saudi Arabian equity\nsecurities. The ability of foreign investors\n(such as the Fund) to invest in the securities\nof Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new.\nSuch ability could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership in such securities. In\naddition, the Capital Market Authority ( \u201c CMA\n\u201d ) places investment limitations on the\nownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers by foreign investors, including a\nlimitation on the Fund\u2019s ownership of the\nsecurities of any single issuer listed on the\nSaudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may\nprevent the Fund from investing in accordance\nwith its strategy and contribute to tracking\nerror against the Underlying Index. These\nrestrictions may be changed or new\nrestrictions, such as licensing requirements,\nspecial approvals or additional foreign taxes,\nmay be instituted at any time. The Fund may\nnot be able to obtain or maintain any such\nlicenses or approvals and may not be able to\nbuy and sell securities at full value. Major\ndisruptions or regulatory changes could occur\nin the Saudi Arabian market, any of which\ncould negatively impact the Fund. These risks\nmay be exacerbated, compared to more developed\nmarkets, given the limited history of foreign\ninvestment in the Saudi Arabian market.\nInvestments in Saudi Arabia may also be\nsubject to loss due to expropriation or\nnationalization of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on additional\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital. Such heightened risks may include,\namong others, restrictions on and government\nintervention in international trade,\nconfiscatory taxation, political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision making,\narmed conflict, crime and instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has\nprivatized, or has begun the process of\nprivatizing, certain entities and industries.\nNewly privatized companies may face strong\ncompetition from government-sponsored\ncompetitors that have not been privatized. In\nsome instances, investors in newly privatized\nentities have suffered losses due to the\ninability of the newly privatized entities to\nadjust quickly to a competitive environment or\nchanging regulatory and legal standards or, in\nsome cases, due to re-nationalization of such\nprivatized entities. There is no assurance\nthat similar losses will not recur. Further,\nunder income tax\n\n20\n\nlaws imposed by the General Authority of Zakat\nand Tax, dividends paid by a Saudi Arabian\ncompany to foreign stockholders are generally\nsubject to a 5% withholding tax (different tax\nrates may apply pursuant to an applicable\ntreaty). Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on\nincome from the sale of petroleum and trade\nwith other countries involved in the sale of\npetroleum, and its economy is therefore\nvulnerable to changes in foreign currency\nvalues and the market for petroleum, as well\nas acts targeting petroleum production or\nprocessing facilities in Saudi Arabia. As\nglobal demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi\nArabia may be significantly impacted. In the\nrecent past, the Saudi Arabian government has\nexplored privatization and diversification of\nthe economy in the wake of a diminished\npetroleum market. Like most Middle Eastern\ngovernments, the government of Saudi Arabia\nexercises substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector. Although\nliberalization in the wider economy is\nunderway, in many areas it has lagged\nsignificantly: restrictions on foreign\nownership persist, and the government has an\nownership stake in many key industries. The\nsituation is exacerbated by the fact that\nSaudi Arabia is governed by an absolute\nmonarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Incidents involving a Middle Eastern\ncountry\u2019s or the region\u2019s security, including\nterrorism, may cause uncertainty in their\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. Governmental\nactions in the future could have a significant\neffect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia,\nwhich could affect private sector companies\nand the Fund, as well as the value of\nsecurities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio. Any\neconomic sanctions on Saudi Arabian\nindividuals or Saudi Arabian corporate\nentities, or even the threat of sanctions, may\nresult in the decline of the value and\nliquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a\nweakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse\nconsequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. Any\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Saudi Arabian securities and/or\nfunds investing in prohibited assets,\nimpairing the ability of the Fund to buy,\nsell, receive or deliver those securities\nand/or assets. In addition, Saudi Arabia\u2019s\neconomy relies heavily on cheap, foreign\nlabor, and changes in the availability of this\nlabor supply could have an adverse effect on\nthe economy. The securities markets in Saudi\nArabia may not be as developed as those in\nother countries. As a result, securities\nmarkets in Saudi Arabia are subject to greater\nrisks associated with market volatility, lower\nmarket capitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations, uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets, governmental\ncontrol and heavy regulation of labor and\nindustry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian\ncompanies tend to trade less frequently than\nthose of companies on exchanges in more\ndeveloped markets. Such infrequent trading may\nadversely affect the pricing of these\nsecurities and the Fund\u2019s ability to sell\nthese securities in the future. Although the\npolitical situation in Saudi Arabia is largely\nstable, Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced political instability, and there\nremains the possibility that the stability\nwill not hold in the future or that\ninstability in the larger Middle East region\ncould adversely impact the economy of Saudi\nArabia. Instability may be caused by military\ndevelopments, government interventions in the\nmarketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes,\nattempted social or political reforms,\nreligious differences, or other factors.\nAdditionally, anti-Western views held by\ncertain groups in the Middle East may\ninfluence government policies regarding\nforeign investment. Further developments in\nU.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other\nMiddle-Eastern countries may affect these\nattitudes and policies. The U.S. is a\nsignificant trading partner of, or foreign\ninvestor in, Saudi Arabia. As a result,\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be\nparticularly affected by changes in the U.S.\neconomy. A decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, new trade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar\nexchange rate or an economic slowdown in the\nU.S. may have a material adverse effect on the\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a\nresult, securities to which the Fund has\nexposure. Political instability in North\nAfrica and the larger Middle East region has\ncaused significant disruptions to many\nindustries. Continued political and social\nunrest in these areas may negatively affect\nthe value of securities in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Certain issuers located in Saudi\nArabia may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain\ndamage to its reputation if it is identified\nas an issuer which operates in, or has\ndealings with, such countries. The Fund, as an\ninvestor in such issuers, will be indirectly\nsubject to those risks. Risk of Investing in\nthe Consumer Discretionary Sector. Companies\nengaged in the design, production or\ndistribution of products or services for the\nconsumer discretionary sector (including,\nwithout limitation, television and radio\nbroadcasting, manufacturing, publishing,\nrecording and musical instruments, motion\npictures, photography, amusement and theme\nparks,\n\n21\n\ngaming casinos, sporting goods and sports\narenas, camping and recreational equipment,\ntoys and games, apparel, travel-related\nservices, automobiles, hotels and motels, and\nfast food and other restaurants) are subject\nto the risk that their products or services\nmay become obsolete quickly. The success of\nthese companies can depend heavily on\ndisposable household income and consumer\nspending. During periods of an expanding\neconomy, the consumer discretionary sector may\noutperform the consumer staples sector, but\nmay underperform when economic conditions\nworsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary\nsector can be significantly affected by\nseveral factors, including, without\nlimitation, the performance of domestic and\ninternational economies, exchange rates,\nchanging consumer preferences, demographics,\nmarketing campaigns, cyclical revenue\ngeneration, consumer confidence, commodity\nprice volatility, labor relations, interest\nrates, import and export controls, intense\ncompetition, technological developments and\ngovernment regulation. Risk of Investing in\nthe Consumer Staples Sector. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector may be adversely\naffected by changes in the global economy,\nconsumer spending, competition, demographics\nand consumer preferences, and production\nspending. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may also be affected by changes in\nglobal economic, environmental and political\nevents, economic conditions, the depletion of\nresources, and government regulation. For\ninstance, government regulations may affect\nthe permissibility of using various food\nadditives and production methods of companies\nthat make food products, which could affect\ncompany profitability. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector also may be subject to\nrisks pertaining to the supply of, demand for\nand prices of raw materials. The prices of raw\nmaterials fluctuate in response to a number of\nfactors, including, without limitation,\nchanges in government agricultural support\nprograms, exchange rates, import and export\ncontrols, changes in international\nagricultural and trading policies, and\nseasonal and weather conditions. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector may be subject to\nsevere competition, which may also have an\nadverse impact on their profitability. Risk of\nInvesting in the Energy Sector. Companies in\nthe energy sector are strongly affected by the\nchanges in and volatility of global energy\nprices, energy supply and demand, government\nregulations and policies, energy production\nand conservation efforts, technological\nchange, development of alternative energy\nsources, and other factors that they cannot\ncontrol. Energy companies may have relatively\nhigh levels of debt and may be more likely to\nrestructure their businesses if there are\ndownturns in energy markets or in the global\neconomy. If an energy company in the Fund's\nportfolio becomes distressed, the Fund could\nlose all or a substantial portion of its\ninvestment. The energy sector is cyclical and\nis highly dependent on commodity prices.\nPrices and supplies of energy may fluctuate\nsignificantly over short and long periods of\ntime due to, among other things, national and\ninternational political changes, Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d )\npolicies, changes in relationships among OPEC\nmembers and between OPEC and oil-importing\nnations, the regulatory environment, taxation\npolicies, the enactment or cessation of trade\nsanctions, war or other geopolitical\nconflicts, and the economies of key energy-\nconsuming countries. Companies in the energy\nsector may be adversely affected by terrorism,\ncyber incidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to\n\n22\n\npredict and depend on a number of factors. The\neffect of these events or any related\ndevelopments could be significant and may have\na severe adverse effect on the performance of\nthe Fund. Risk of Investing in the Financials\nSector. Companies in the financials sector\ninclude small, regional and money center\nbanks, securities brokerage firms, asset\nmanagement companies, savings banks and thrift\ninstitutions, specialty finance companies (\ne.g. , credit card, mortgage providers),\ninsurance and insurance brokerage firms,\nconsumer finance firms, financial\nconglomerates and foreign banking and\nfinancial companies. Most financial companies\nare subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which limits their activities and\nmay affect their ability to earn a profit from\na given line of business. Government\nregulation may change frequently and may have\nsignificant adverse consequences for companies\nin the financials sector, including effects\nnot intended by the regulation. Direct\ngovernmental intervention in the operations of\nfinancial companies and financial markets may\nmaterially and adversely affect the companies\nin which the Fund invests, including\nlegislation in many countries that may\nincrease government regulation, repatriation\nand other intervention. The impact of\ngovernmental intervention and legislative\nchanges on any individual financial company or\non the financials sector as a whole cannot be\npredicted. The valuation of financial\ncompanies has been and continues to be subject\nto unprecedented volatility and may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors, including\ninterest rate risk and sovereign debt default.\nCertain financial businesses are subject to\nintense competitive pressures, including\nmarket share and price competition. Financial\ncompanies in foreign countries are subject to\nmarket-specific and general regulatory and\ninterest rate concerns. In particular,\ngovernment regulation in certain foreign\ncountries may include taxes and controls on\ninterest rates, credit availability, minimum\ncapital requirements, bans on short sales,\nlimits on prices and restrictions on currency\ntransfers. In addition, companies in the\nfinancials sector may be the targets of\nhacking and potential theft of proprietary or\ncustomer information or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a material adverse\neffect on their businesses. The profitability\nof banks, savings and loan associations and\nother financial companies is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change; for instance, when interest\nrates go up, the value of securities issued by\nmany types of companies in the financials\nsector generally goes down. In other words,\nfinancial companies may be adversely affected\nin certain market cycles, including, without\nlimitation, during periods of rising interest\nrates, which may restrict the availability and\nincrease the cost of capital, and during\nperiods of declining economic conditions,\nwhich may cause, among other things, credit\nlosses due to financial difficulties of\nborrowers. In addition, general economic\nconditions are important to the operations of\nthese companies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products.\n\n23\n\nPatents have a limited duration, and, upon\nexpiration, other companies may market\nsubstantially similar \u201c generic \u201d products\nthat are typically sold at a lower price than\nthe patented product, which can cause the\noriginal developer of the product to lose\nmarket share and/or reduce the price charged\nfor the product, resulting in lower profits\nfor the original developer. As a result, the\nexpiration of patents may adversely affect the\nprofitability of these companies. In addition,\nbecause the products and services of many\ncompanies in the healthcare sector affect the\nhealth and well-being of many individuals,\nthese companies are especially susceptible to\nextensive litigation based on product\nliability and similar claims. Healthcare\ncompanies are subject to competitive forces\nthat may make it difficult to raise prices\nand, in fact, may result in price discounting.\nMany new products in the healthcare sector may\nbe subject to regulatory approvals. The\nprocess of obtaining such approvals may be\nlong and costly, which can result in increased\ndevelopment costs, delayed cost recovery and\nloss of competitive advantage to the extent\nthat rival companies have developed competing\nproducts or procedures, adversely affecting\nthe company\u2019s revenues and profitability. In\nother words, delays in the regulatory approval\nprocess may diminish the opportunity for a\ncompany to profit from a new product or to\nbring a new product to market, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on a company\u2019s\nbusiness. Healthcare companies may also be\nstrongly affected by scientific biotechnology\nor technological developments, and their\nproducts may quickly become obsolete. Also,\nmany healthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Industrials Sector. The value\nof securities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply of and demand for both their\nspecific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, companies in the industrials\nsector may be subject to liability for\nenvironmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Materials Sector.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control,\namong other factors. Such risks may adversely\naffect the issuers to which the Fund has\nexposure. Companies in the materials sector\nare also at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in the Real\nEstate Industry. Companies in the real estate\nindustry include companies that invest in real\nestate, such as REITs, real estate holding and\noperating companies or real estate development\ncompanies (collectively, \u201c Real Estate\nCompanies \u201d ). Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies exposes investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly, as well as to\nrisks that relate specifically to the way in\nwhich Real Estate Companies are organized and\noperated. The real estate industry is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and developments, and characterized\nby intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies involves various risks. Some risks\nthat are specific to Real Estate Companies are\ndiscussed in greater detail below.\n\n24\n\nConcentration Risk. Real Estate Companies may\nown a limited number of properties and\nconcentrate their investments in a particular\ngeographic region or property type. Economic\ndownturns affecting a particular region,\nindustry or property type may lead to a high\nvolume of defaults within a short period.\nDistressed Investment Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in distressed, defaulted\nor out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and\nimplementation by a Real Estate Company of\nloan modification and restructure programs\ninvolves a high degree of uncertainty. Even\nsuccessful implementation may still require\nadverse compromises and may not prevent\nbankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also\ninvest in other debt instruments that may\nbecome non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt or erratic\nprice fluctuations. In addition, real estate\nis relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other capital\nexpenditures, the income and ability of a Real\nEstate Company to make payments of any\ninterest and principal on its debt securities\nwill be adversely affected. Loan Foreclosure\nRisk. Real Estate Companies may foreclose on\nloans that the Real Estate Company originated\nand/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate\nnegative publicity for the underlying property\nthat affects its market value. In addition to\nthe length and expense of such proceedings,\nthe validity of the terms of the applicable\nloan may not be recognized in foreclosure\nproceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by\nborrowers or other lenders may interfere with\nthe enforcement of rights by a Real Estate\nCompany. Parallel proceedings, such as\nbankruptcy, may also delay resolution and\nlimit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed\nloan by a Real Estate Company even where the\nproperty underlying the loan is liquidated.\nManagement Risk. Real Estate Companies are\ndependent upon management skills and may have\nlimited financial resources. Real Estate\nCompanies are generally not diversified and\nmay be subject to heavy cash flow dependency,\ndefault by borrowers and voluntary\nliquidation. In addition, transactions between\nReal Estate Companies and their affiliates may\nbe subject to conflicts of interest, which may\nadversely affect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\nshareholders. A Real Estate Company may also\nhave joint venture investments in certain of\nits properties, and, consequently, its ability\nto control decisions relating to such\nproperties may be limited. Property Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may be subject to risks\nrelating to functional obsolescence or reduced\ndesirability of properties; extended vacancies\ndue to economic conditions and tenant\nbankruptcies; catastrophic events such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts;\nand casualty or condemnation losses. Real\nestate income and values also may be greatly\naffected by demographic trends, such as\npopulation shifts or changes in consumer\npreferences and values, or increasing\nvacancies or declining rents resulting from\nlegal, cultural, technological, global or\nlocal economic developments. Regulatory Risk.\nReal estate income and values may be adversely\naffected by such factors as applicable\ndomestic and foreign laws (including tax\nlaws). Government actions, such as tax\nincreases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other commercial restrictions or\nenvironmental regulations, also may have a\nmajor impact on real estate income and values.\nIn addition, quarterly compliance with\nregulations limiting the proportion of asset\ntypes held by a U.S. REIT may force certain\nReal Estate Companies to liquidate or\nrestructure otherwise attractive investments.\nSome countries may not recognize REITs or\ncomparable structures as a viable form of real\nestate funds.\n\n25\n\nUnderlying Investment Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies make investments in a variety of\ndebt and equity instruments with varying risk\nprofiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies\nmay invest in debt instruments secured by\ncommercial property that have higher risks of\ndelinquency and foreclosure than loans on\nsingle family homes due to a variety of\nfactors associated with commercial property,\nincluding the tie between income available to\nservice debt and productive use of the\nproperty. Real Estate Companies may also\ninvest in debt instruments and preferred\nequity that are junior in an issuer\u2019s capital\nstructure and that involve privately\nnegotiated structures. Subordinated debt\ninvestments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine\nloans, involve a greater credit risk of\ndefault due to the need to service more senior\ndebt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred\nequity investments involve a greater risk of\nloss than conventional debt financing due to\ntheir non-collateralized nature and\nsubordinated ranking. Investments in\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities may also\nbe junior in priority in the event of\nbankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments\nin senior loans may be effectively\nsubordinated if the senior loan is pledged as\ncollateral. The ability of a holder of junior\nclaims to proceed against a defaulting issuer\nis circumscribed by the terms of the\nparticular contractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nA REIT that successfully maintains its\nqualification may still become subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes, including\nexcise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage\nrecording, and transfer taxes, both directly\nand indirectly through its subsidiaries.\nBecause REITs often do not provide complete\ntax information until after the calendar year-\nend, the Fund may at times need to request\npermission to extend the deadline for issuing\nyour tax reporting statement or supplement the\ninformation otherwise provided to you. Risk of\nInvesting in the Technology Sector. Technology\ncompanies are characterized by periodic new\nproduct introductions, innovations and\nevolving industry standards, and, as a result,\nface intense competition, both domestically\nand internationally, which may have an adverse\neffect on profit margins. Companies in the\ntechnology sector are often smaller and less\nexperienced companies and may be subject to\ngreater risks than larger companies; these\nrisks may be heightened for technology\ncompanies in foreign markets. Technology\ncompanies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel. The\nproducts of technology companies may face\nproduct obsolescence due to rapid\ntechnological developments and frequent new\nproduct introduction, changes in consumer and\nbusiness purchasing patterns, unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for\nthe services of qualified personnel. In\naddition, a rising interest rate environment\ntends to negatively affect companies in the\ntechnology sector because, in such an\nenvironment, those companies with high market\nvaluations may appear less attractive to\ninvestors, which may cause sharp decreases in\nthe companies\u2019 market prices. Companies in the\ntechnology sector are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights. The\nloss or impairment of these rights may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. Companies in the technology sector\nare facing increased government and regulatory\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or regulatory action. The\ntechnology sector may also be adversely\naffected by changes or trends in commodity\nprices, which may be influenced or\ncharacterized by unpredictable factors.\nFinally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the technology sector may\nbe particular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nRisk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. The\nutilities sector may be adversely affected by\nchanging commodity prices, government\nregulation stipulating rates charged by\nutilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax\nlaws, interest rate fluctuations and changes\nin the cost of providing specific utility\nservices. The utilities industry is also\nsubject to potential terrorist attacks,\nnatural disasters and severe weather\nconditions, as well as regulatory and\noperational burdens associated with the\noperation and maintenance of nuclear\nfacilities. Government regulators monitor and\ncontrol utility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility profits. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in the Fund's portfolio may own or\noperate nuclear generating facilities.\nGovernmental authorities may from time to time\nreview existing policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\n\n26\n\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policy For the Fund, the Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities to BFA pursuant to the Fund's Proxy\nVoting Policy, and BFA has adopted policies\nand procedures (collectively, the \u201c iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d ) governing proxy\nvoting by accounts managed by BFA, including\nthe Fund. Under the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting\nPolicies, BFA will vote proxies related to\nFund securities in the best interests of the\nFund and its shareholders. From time to time,\na vote may present a conflict between the\ninterests of the Fund\u2019s shareholders, on the\none hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated\nperson of the Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA\nmaintains policies and procedures that are\ndesigned to prevent undue influence on BFA\u2019s\nproxy voting activity that might stem from any\nrelationship between the issuer of a proxy (or\nany dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s\naffiliates, the Fund or the Fund\u2019s affiliates.\nMost conflicts are managed through a\nstructural separation of BFA\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Group from BFA\u2019s employees with\nsales and client responsibilities. In\naddition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure\nthat all engagements with corporate issuers or\ndissident shareholders are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BFA\u2019s\nrelationship with the issuer of the proxy or\nthe dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Fund's portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ending\nJune 30 will be available: (i) without charge,\nupon request, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Fund's website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, the Fund discloses\non its website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of the Fund\u2019s next\nnet asset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: The Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of the Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to the Fund to\nsettle purchases of the Fund ( i.e. Deposit\nSecurities) or that Authorized Participants\nwould receive from the Fund to settle\nredemptions of the Fund ( i.e. Fund\nSecurities). These files are known as the\nPortfolio Composition File and the Fund Data\nFile (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The Files are\napplicable for the next trading day and are\nprovided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an\n\n27\n\nAuthorized Participant or liquidity provider\nthe securities the Fund is willing to accept\nfor a creation, and securities that the Fund\nwill provide on a redemption. BFA employees\nmay also discuss portfolio holdings-related\ninformation with broker/dealers, in connection\nwith settling the Fund\u2019s transactions, as may\nbe necessary to conduct business in the\nordinary course in a manner consistent with\nthe disclosure in the Fund's current\nregistration statement. \u2022 Communications with\nListing Exchanges: From time to time,\nemployees of BFA may discuss portfolio\nholdings information with the applicable\nprimary listing exchange for the Fund as\nneeded to meet the exchange listing standards.\n\u2022 Communications with Other Portfolio\nManagers: Certain information may be provided\nto employees of BFA who manage funds that\ninvest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFund, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Fund, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain the Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of the Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio-level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nConstruction and Maintenance of the Underlying\nIndex A description of the Underlying Index is\nprovided below. With respect to certain\nunderlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA\nor its affiliates have held discussions with\nthe applicable index provider regarding their\nbusiness interest in licensing an index to\ntrack a particular market segment and conveyed\ninvestment concepts and strategies that could\nbe considered for the index. The index\nprovider designed and constituted such indices\nusing concepts conveyed by BFA or its\naffiliates. For certain of these indices, the\nrelevant fund may be the first or sole user of\nthe underlying index. In its sole discretion,\nthe index provider determines the composition\nof the securities and other instruments in\nsuch underlying index, the rebalance protocols\nof the underlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and other instruments in the\nunderlying index, and any updates to the\nmethodology. From time to time, BFA or its\naffiliates may also provide input relating to\npossible methodology changes of such\nunderlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\n\n28\n\nThe MSCI Indexes The MSCI indexes were founded\nin 1969 by Capital International S.A. as\ninternational performance benchmarks\nconstructed to facilitate comparison of world\nmarkets. The MSCI single country standard\nequity indexes have covered the world's\ndeveloped markets since 1969 and in 1987 MSCI\ncommenced coverage of emerging markets. Local\nstock exchanges traditionally calculated their\nown indexes, which were generally not\ncomparable with one another due to differences\nin the representation of the local market,\nmathematical formulas, base dates and methods\nof adjusting for capital changes. MSCI,\nhowever, applies the same calculation\nmethodology to all markets for all single\ncountry standard equity indexes, both\ndeveloped and emerging. MSCI Global Investable\nMarket Indexes MSCI's Global Investable Market\nIndexes (the \u201c MSCI GIMI \u201d ) provide coverage\nand non-overlapping market segmentation by\nmarket capitalization size and by style. The\nMSCI GIMI intend to target approximately 99%\ncoverage of the free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization in each market of large-, mid-\nand small-cap securities. In each market, MSCI\ncreates an Investable Market Index, Standard\nIndex, Large Cap Index, Mid Cap Index and\nSmall Cap Index. The Standard Index, Large Cap\nIndex, Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index are\neach subsets of the Investable Market Index\nfor a market. The MSCI Global Standard Index\nis the aggregation of the Large Cap Index and\nMid Cap Index and the MSCI GIMI is the\naggregation of the MSCI Global Standard Index\nand MSCI Global Small Cap Index. Selection\nCriteria. MSCI's index construction process\ninvolves: (i) defining the equity universe;\n(ii) determining the market investable equity\nuniverse for each market; (iii) determining\nmarket capitalization size segments for each\nmarket; (iv) applying final size segment\ninvestability requirements; and (v) applying\nindex continuity rules for the MSCI Global\nStandard Index. Defining the Equity Universe .\nMSCI begins with securities listed in\ncountries in the MSCI GIMI. As of June 8,\n2023, 23 are classified as developed markets,\n24 as emerging markets, and 21 as frontier\nmarkets (frontier markets exclude the West\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Union, which\nconsists of securities classified in Benin,\nBurkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau,\nMali, Niger, Senegal and Togo). All listed\nequity securities and listed securities that\nexhibit characteristics of equity securities,\nexcept mutual funds, ETFs, equity derivatives,\nlimited partnerships and most investment\ntrusts, are eligible for inclusion in the\nequity universe. REITs in some countries and\ncertain income trusts in Canada are also\neligible for inclusion. Each company and its\nsecurities ( i.e ., share classes) are\nclassified in only one country. Determining\nthe Market Investable Equity Universe for Each\nMarket. The equity universe in any market is\nderived by applying investability screens to\nindividual companies and securities in that\nmarket. Some investability requirements are\napplied at the individual security level and\nsome at the overall company level, represented\nby the aggregation of individual securities of\nthe company. As a result, the inclusion or\nexclusion of one security does not imply the\nautomatic inclusion or exclusion of other\nsecurities of the same company. Determining\nMarket Capitalization Size Segments for Each\nMarket. In order to create size components\nthat can be meaningfully aggregated into\ncomposites, individual market size segments\nbalance the following two objectives: \u2022\nAchieving global size integrity by ensuring\nthat companies of comparable and relevant\nsizes are included in a given size segment\nacross all markets in a composite index; and \u2022\nAchieving consistent market coverage by\nensuring that each market's size segment is\nrepresented in its proportional weight in the\ncomposite universe. The Standard Indexes,\nLarge Cap Indexes, Mid Cap Indexes, and Small\nCap Indexes capture the following market\ncapitalization size segments: \u2022 MSCI Global\nStandard Indexes cover all investable large-\nand mid-cap securities by including the\nlargest issuers comprising approximately 85%\nof each market\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. \u2022 MSCI Global Large Cap\nIndexes provide coverage of all investable\nlarge-cap securities by including the largest\nissuers comprising approximately 70% of each\nmarket\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. \u2022 MSCI Global Mid Cap Indexes\nprovide coverage in each market by deriving\nthe difference between the market coverage of\nthe MSCI Global Standard Index and the MSCI\nGlobal Large Cap Index in that market.\n\n29\n\n\u2022 MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes provide\ncoverage of companies with a market\ncapitalization below that of the companies in\nthe MSCI Global Standard Indexes. Applying\nFinal Size Segment Investability Requirements.\nIn order to enhance replicability of the\nindexes, additional size segment investability\nrequirements are set for the MSCI GIMI and\nMSCI Global Standard Index. These\ninvestability requirements include minimum\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization,\nminimum liquidity, minimum foreign limits and\nminimum length of trading. Applying Index\nContinuity Rules for the Standard Index. In\norder to achieve index continuity as well as\nprovide some basic level of diversification\nwithin a market index, notwithstanding the\neffect of other index construction rules\ncontained herein, a minimum number of five\nconstituents will be maintained for a\ndeveloped market Standard Index and a minimum\nnumber of three constituents will be\nmaintained for an emerging market Standard\nIndex. Weighting. All indexes of the MSCI GIMI\nare free float weighted, i.e., companies are\nincluded in the indexes at the value of their\nfree public float (free float multiplied by\nsecurity price). Regional Weights. Market\ncapitalization-weighting, combined with a\nconsistent target of approximately 99% of free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization, helps\nensure that each country's weight in regional\nand international indexes approximates its\nweight in the total universe of developing and\nemerging markets. A market is equivalent to a\nsingle country except for developed Europe,\nwhere all markets are aggregated into a single\nmarket for index construction purposes.\nIndividual country indexes of the European\ndeveloped markets are derived from the\nconstituents of the MSCI GIMI Europe Index.\nFree Float. MSCI defines the free float of a\nsecurity as the proportion of shares\noutstanding that are deemed to be available\nfor purchase in the public equity markets by\ninternational investors. In practice,\nlimitations on free float available to\ninternational investors include: (i) strategic\nand other shareholdings not considered part of\navailable free float; and (ii) limits on share\nownership for foreigners. MSCI calculates the\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization of\neach security in the equity index universe by\n(i) defining and estimating the free float\navailable to foreign investors; (ii) assigning\na free float-adjustment factor to each\nsecurity; and (iii) calculating the free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of each\nsecurity. Under MSCI's free float-adjustment\nmethodology, a constituent's inclusion factor\nis equal to its estimated free float, rounded\nup to the closest 5% for constituents with\nfree float equal to or exceeding 15%. For\nexample, a constituent security with a free\nfloat of 23.2% will be included in the index\nat 25% of its market capitalization. For\nsecurities with a free float of less than 15%,\nthe estimated free float is adjusted to the\nnearest 1%. Price and Exchange Rates Prices.\nThe prices used to calculate all MSCI indexes\nare the official exchange closing prices or\nthose figures accepted as such. MSCI reserves\nthe right to use an alternative pricing source\non any given day. Exchange Rates. MSCI uses\nthe World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates\ntaken at 4:00 p.m. London time. In case World\nMarkets/Reuters does not provide rates for\nspecific markets on given days (for example,\nChristmas Day and New Year's Day), the\nprevious business day's rates are normally\nused. MSCI independently monitors the exchange\nrates on all its indexes. MSCI may under\nexceptional circumstances elect to use\nalternative sources of exchange rates if the\nWorld Markets/Reuters rates are not available,\nor if MSCI determines that the World\nMarkets/Reuters rates are not reflective of\nmarket circumstances for a given currency on a\nparticular day. In such circumstances, an\nannouncement would be sent to clients with the\nrelated information. If appropriate, MSCI may\nconduct a consultation with the investment\ncommunity to gather feedback on the most\nrelevant exchange rate. Changes to the\nIndexes. The MSCI GIMI are maintained with the\nobjective of reflecting, on a timely basis,\nthe evolution of the underlying equity\nmarkets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes,\nemphasis is also placed on continuity,\nreplicability and minimizing turnover in the\nindexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves\nmany aspects, including: (i) additions to, and\ndeletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in\nnumber of shares; and (iii) changes in\ninclusion factors as a result of updated free\nfloat estimates. Index maintenance can be\ndescribed by three broad categories of\nchanges:\n\n30\n\n\u2022 Semi-Annual Index Reviews ( \u201c SAIRs \u201d ),\nconducted on a fixed semi-annual timetable\nthat systematically reassess the various\ndimensions of the equity universe for all\nmarkets; \u2022 Quarterly Index Reviews ( \u201c QIRs \u201d\n), aimed at promptly reflecting other\nsignificant market events; and \u2022 Ongoing\nevent-related changes, such as mergers,\nacquisitions, spin-offs, bankruptcies,\nreorganizations and other similar corporate\nevents, which generally are implemented in the\nindexes as they occur. Potential changes in\nthe status of countries (stand-alone,\nfrontier, emerging and developed) follow their\nown implementation time tables. MSCI conducts\nSAIRs generally as of the close of the last\nbusiness day of May and November. During the\nSAIRs, MSCI updates the investable equity\nuniverse and reassesses size segmentation\ninvestability requirements. MSCI also conducts\nQIRs generally as of the close of the last\nbusiness day of February and August. During\nthe QIRs, MSCI reflects changes in the index\nthat were not captured at the time of their\nactual occurrence, but are significant enough\nto be included before the next SAIR. The\nresults of the SAIR and QIR are generally\nannounced at least ten business days in\nadvance of implementation. Creation of Sector\nand Industry Indexes using the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) All\nsecurities in the Global Investable Equity\nUniverse are assigned to the industry that\nbest describes their business activities using\nthe GICS. The GICS consists of sectors,\nindustry groups, industries and sub-\nindustries. Under the GICS, each company is\nassigned to one unique sub-industry according\nto its principal business activity (generally\ndefined as the business activity that\ngenerates 60% or more of the company\u2019s\nrevenues). Narrower indexes may be derived\nbased on industry classification, and may\ncontain securities belonging to specific\nsectors, industry groups, industries, sub-\nindustries or a combination thereof. MSCI\nEmerging Markets Quality Factor Select Index\nNumber of Components: approximately 337 Index\nDescription. The MSCI Emerging Markets Quality\nFactor Select Index seeks to measure the\nperformance of securities in its parent index,\nthe MSCI Emerging Markets Index, that exhibit\nhigher quality characteristics relative to\ntheir peers within the corresponding GICS\nsector, while covering approximately 50% of\nthe market capitalization within each country\nin the parent index. Index Methodology. The\nUnderlying Index includes securities that are\nchosen from constituents within the parent\nindex. The Underlying Index aims to capture\nthe performance of high-quality stocks within\nthe parent index by identifying securities\nwith high \u201c quality scores \u201d based on three\nvariables: High return on equity: Based on\ntrailing 12-month earnings per share divided\nby the latest book value per share. Stable\nyear-over-year earnings growth: Based on\nstandard deviation of year-over-year earnings\nper share growth over last five fiscal years.\nLow financial leverage: Based on latest fiscal\nyear total debt-to-book value. The methodology\ncalculates a \u201c quality score \u201d for each\nsecurity in the parent index by averaging the\ncalculated z-scores of the three fundamental\nvariables above. A sector relative quality\nscore is then derived by standardizing the\ncomposite quality z-scores within each sector.\nThe sector-relative quality scores are then\nstandardized at +/- 3 standard deviations. If\na quality score is not calculated due to the\nunavailability of certain fundamental\nvariables as described in the methodology, the\nquality score is set at -3. Securities are\nthen included based on their quality score\nranking (from highest ranking until lowest)\nuntil the securities cover 50% of the market\ncapitalization (calculated using the free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization) within\neach country in the parent index subject to\ncertain additional constraints. The weight of\neach constituent is then determined by\nmultiplying each security\u2019s market\ncapitalization weight in the parent index by a\n\u201c tilt score \u201d . The tilt score is based on\n(i) a \u201c quality coverage score, \u201d calculated\nas the corresponding cumulative weight within\nthe parent index when sorted by the highest\nquality score in descending order and (ii)\nrelative position based on market\ncapitalization. The resulting weights are then\nnormalized so that component weights in the\nUnderlying Index sum to 100%. Additionally,\neach individual issuer is capped at 5% and\nother constraints, such as country and sector\nweight limits relative to the parent index,\nare applied. The Underlying Index is reviewed\nand rebalanced on a semi-annual basis. A\nbuffer rule and turnover threshold are also\napplied to reduce index turnover and enhance\nindex stability.\n\n31\n\nCalculation Methodology . The Fund utilizes\nthe Underlying Index calculated with net\ndividends reinvested. MSCI uses the index\nconstituent companies\u2019 country of\nincorporation to determine the relevant\ndividend withholding tax rates in calculating\nthe net dividends. The regular cash dividend\nis reinvested after deduction of withholding\ntax by applying the maximum rate of the\ncompany\u2019s country of incorporation applicable\nto institutional investors. Net dividends\nmeans dividends after taxes withheld at the\nrate applicable to non-resident institutional\ninvestors who do not benefit from double\ntaxation treaties. Such withholding rates may\ndiffer from those applicable to U.S.\nresidents. Investment Policies The Board has\nadopted as fundamental policies the following\nnumbered investment policies, which cannot be\nchanged without the approval of the holders of\na majority of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. A vote of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund is\ndefined in the Investment Company Act as the\nlesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities present at a shareholder meeting,\nif the holders of more than 50% of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (ii) more\nthan 50% of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund. The Fund has also adopted certain\nnon-fundamental investment policies, including\nits investment objective. Non-fundamental\ninvestment policies may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval. Therefore,\nthe Fund may change its investment objective\nand its Underlying Index without shareholder\napproval. Fundamental Investment Policies The\nFund may not: 1. Concentrate its investments\nin a particular industry, as that term is used\nin the Investment Company Act, except that the\nFund will concentrate to approximately the\nsame extent that its Underlying Index\nconcentrates in the securities of a particular\nindustry or group of industries. 2. Borrow\nmoney, except as permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act. 3. Issue senior\nsecurities to the extent such issuance would\nviolate the Investment Company Act. 4.\nPurchase or hold real estate, except the Fund\nmay purchase and hold securities or other\ninstruments that are secured by, or linked to,\nreal estate or interests therein, securities\nof REITs, mortgage-related securities and\nsecurities of issuers engaged in the real\nestate business, and the Fund may purchase and\nhold real estate as a result of the ownership\nof securities or other instruments. 5.\nUnderwrite securities issued by others, except\nto the extent that the sale of portfolio\nsecurities by the Fund may be deemed to be an\nunderwriting or as otherwise permitted by\napplicable law. 6. Purchase or sell\ncommodities or commodity contracts, except as\npermitted by the Investment Company Act. 7.\nMake loans to the extent prohibited by the\nInvestment Company Act. Notations Regarding\nthe Fund's Fundamental Investment Policies The\nfollowing notations are not considered to be\npart of the Fund\u2019s fundamental investment\npolicies and are subject to change without\nshareholder approval. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to concentration\nset forth in (1) above, the Investment Company\nAct does not define what constitutes \u201c\nconcentration \u201d in an industry. The SEC staff\nhas taken the position that investment of 25%\nor more of a fund\u2019s total assets in one or\nmore issuers conducting their principal\nactivities in the same industry or group of\nindustries constitutes concentration. It is\npossible that interpretations of concentration\ncould change in the future. The policy in (1)\nabove will be interpreted to refer to\nconcentration as that term may be interpreted\nfrom time to time. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to permit investment without limit\nin the following: securities of the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; securities of state,\nterritory, possession or municipal governments\nand their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\nthe Fund's industry classifications, the Fund\ncurrently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market\n\n32\n\nindexes or rating group indexes, and/or as\ndefined by Fund management. The policy also\nwill be interpreted to give broad authority to\nthe Fund as to how to classify issuers within\nor among industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits the Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund's total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires the Fund to maintain at all times\nan \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300% of the\namount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means\nthe ratio that the value of the Fund's total\nassets (including amounts borrowed), minus\nliabilities other than borrowings, bears to\nthe aggregate amount of all borrowings.\nBorrowing money to increase portfolio holdings\nis known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d Certain trading\npractices and investments, such as reverse\nrepurchase agreements, may be considered to be\nborrowings or involve leverage and thus are\nsubject to the Investment Company Act\nrestrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4\nunder the Investment Company Act, when the\nFund engages in reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions, the Fund\nmay either (i) maintain asset coverage of at\nleast 300% with respect to such transactions\nand any other borrowings in the aggregate, or\n(ii) treat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of a fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the business of underwriting, the\npolicy in (5) above will be interpreted not to\nprevent a fund from engaging in transactions\ninvolving the acquisition or disposition of\nportfolio securities, regardless of whether a\nfund may be considered to be an underwriter\nunder the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in\nthe underwriting business to the extent\npermitted by applicable law. With respect to\nthe fundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit the Fund from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies The Fund\nhas adopted a non-fundamental policy not to\nmake short sales of securities or maintain a\nshort position, except to the extent permitted\nby the Fund's Prospectus and SAI, as amended\nfrom time to time, and applicable law. The\nFund has adopted a non-fundamental investment\npolicy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the\nInvestment Company Act to invest, under normal\ncircumstances, at least 80% of the value of\nits net assets, plus the amount of any\nborrowings for investment purposes, in the\ncomponent securities of its Underlying Index\nor in depositary receipts representing\ncomponent securities in its Underlying Index.\nThe Fund also has adopted a policy to provide\nits shareholders with at least 60 days\u2019 prior\nwritten notice of any change in such policy.\nIf, subsequent to an investment, the 80%\nrequirement is no longer met, the Fund\u2019s\nfuture investments will be made in a manner\nthat will bring the Fund into compliance with\nthis policy. The Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental policy not to purchase securities\nof other investment companies, except to the\nextent permitted by the Investment Company\nAct. As a matter of policy, however, the Fund\nwill not purchase shares of any registered\nopen-end investment company or registered unit\ninvestment trust, in reliance on Section\n12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the \u201c fund of funds \u201d\nprovisions) of the Investment Company Act, at\nany time the Fund has knowledge that its\nshares are purchased by another investment\ncompany investor in reliance on the provisions\nof subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).\n\n33\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all limitations\nunder the Fund's fundamental or non-\nfundamental investment policies apply only at\nthe time that a transaction is undertaken. Any\nchange in the percentage of the Fund's assets\ninvested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from market fluctuations\nor other changes in the Fund\u2019s total assets\nwill not require the Fund to dispose of an\ninvestment until BFA determines that it is\npracticable to sell or close out the\ninvestment without undue market or tax\nconsequences. Continuous Offering The method\nby which Creation Units are created and traded\nmay raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Fund on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery requirement and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client\nmay be deemed a statutory underwriter if it\ntakes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into\nconstituent shares and sells such shares\ndirectly to customers or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of new shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the 1933 Act must take into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-\ndealer or its client in the particular case\nand the examples mentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions\nin shares, whether or not participating in the\ndistribution of shares, generally are required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in\nrespect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus delivery obligation with\nrespect to shares of the Fund are reminded\nthat, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act,\na prospectus delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange\nmember in connection with a sale on the\nListing Exchange generally is satisfied by the\nfact that the prospectus is available at the\nListing Exchange upon request. The prospectus\ndelivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\nan exchange. Management Trustees and Officers.\nThe Board has responsibility for the overall\nmanagement and operations of the Fund,\nincluding general supervision of the duties\nperformed by BFA and other service providers.\nEach Trustee serves until he or she resigns,\nis removed, dies, retires or becomes\nincapacitated. Each officer shall hold office\nuntil his or her successor is elected and\nqualifies or until his or her death,\nresignation or removal. Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Trust are referred to as\nindependent trustees ( \u201c Independent Trustees\n\u201d ). The registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nBlackRock-advised Funds \u201d ) are organized into\none complex of open-end equity, multi-asset,\nindex and money market funds and ETFs (the \u201c\nBlackRock Multi-Asset Complex \u201d ), one complex\nof closed-end funds and open-end non-index\nfixed-income funds (including ETFs) (the \u201c\nBlackRock Fixed-Income Complex \u201d ) and one\ncomplex of ETFs ( \u201c Exchange-Traded Fund\nComplex \u201d ) (each, a \u201c BlackRock Fund Complex\n\u201d ). The Fund is included in the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves\nas a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee\nof iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result,\noversees all of the funds within the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex, which consists of 406\nfunds as of December 4, 2023.

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Fund rests\nwith the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to\nmanage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The\nBoard is responsible for overseeing BFA and\nother service providers in the operations of\nthe Fund in accordance with the provisions of\nthe 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state\nand other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The\nBoard is currently composed of eleven members,\nnine of whom are Independent Trustees. The\nBoard currently conducts regular in person\nmeetings four times a year. In addition, the\nBoard frequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The Independent Trustees meet\nregularly outside the presence of management,\nin executive session or with other service\nproviders to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Fund, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Fund with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the oversight functions delegated to\nthe Committee by the Board and reports its\nfinding to the Board. The Board and each\nstanding Committee conduct annual assessments\nof their oversight function and structure. The\nBoard has determined that the Board\u2019s\nleadership structure is appropriate because it\nallows the Board to exercise independent\njudgment over management and it allocates\nareas of responsibility among committees of\nIndependent Trustees and the full Board to\nenhance effective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Fund is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. The\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Fund. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of the\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Fund. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by the Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting the Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Fund's\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support the Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight\n\n42\n\nresponsibilities. From time to time, the Board\nmay modify the manner in which it conducts\nrisk oversight. The Board\u2019s oversight role\ndoes not make it a guarantor of the Fund's\ninvestment performance or other activities.\nCommittees of the Board of Trustees.

Control\nPersons and Principal Holders of Securities.\nOwnership information is not provided for the\nFund, as it has not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI. Conflicts of Interest.\nCertain activities of BFA, BlackRock, Inc. and\nthe other subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc.\n(collectively referred to in this section as \u201c\nBlackRock \u201d ) and their respective directors,\nofficers and employees, with respect to the\nFund and/or other accounts managed by\nBlackRock, may give rise to actual or\nperceived conflicts of interest such as those\ndescribed below. BlackRock is one of the\nworld's largest asset management firms.\nBlackRock, its subsidiaries and their\nrespective directors, officers and employees,\nincluding the business units or entities and\npersonnel who may be involved in the\ninvestment activities and business operations\nof the Fund, are engaged worldwide in\nbusinesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Fund. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by the Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of the\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's\n\n48\n\nperformance. Such transactions, particularly\nin respect of most proprietary accounts or\nclient accounts, will be executed\nindependently of the Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFund. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell\nthe same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding the Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor the Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of the\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding\nthe Fund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for the Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause the Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so. Conflicts may also\narise because portfolio decisions regarding\nthe Fund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby the Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and\nthe purchase of a security or covering of a\nshort position in a security by the Fund may\nincrease the price of the same security held\nby (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its\nother accounts or funds. In addition, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, the Fund\nmay invest its assets in other funds advised\nby BlackRock, including funds that are managed\nby one or more of the same portfolio managers,\nwhich could result in conflicts of interest\nrelating to asset allocation, timing of Fund\npurchases and sales, and increased\nremuneration and profitability for BlackRock,\nand/or its personnel, including portfolio\nmanagers. In certain circumstances, BlackRock,\non behalf of the Fund, may seek to buy from or\nsell securities to another fund or account\nadvised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is\nnot required to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Fund, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Fund. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when the\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which the Fund\nhas invested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of\nthe Fund's investments may be negatively\nimpacted by the activities of BlackRock or its\nclients, and transactions for the Fund may be\nimpaired or effected at prices or terms that\nmay be less favorable than would otherwise\nhave been the case. The results of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities may differ significantly\nfrom the results achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by the\nFund. Moreover, it is possible that the Fund\nwill sustain losses during periods in which\none or more proprietary or other accounts\nmanaged or advised by BlackRock achieve\nsignificant profits. The opposite result is\nalso possible. From time to time, the Fund may\nbe restricted from purchasing or selling\nsecurities, or from engaging in other\ninvestment activities because of regulatory,\nlegal or contractual requirements applicable\nto BlackRock or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock, and/or the internal\npolicies of BlackRock designed to comply with\nsuch requirements. As a result, there may be\nperiods, for example, when BlackRock will not\ninitiate or recommend certain types of\ntransactions in certain securities or\ninstruments with respect to which BlackRock is\nperforming services or when position limits\nhave been reached. For example, the investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and accounts under its management may\n\n49\n\nlimit the investment opportunities for the\nFund in certain emerging and other markets in\nwhich limitations are imposed upon the amount\nof investment, in the aggregate or in\nindividual issuers, by affiliated foreign\ninvestors. In connection with its management\nof the Fund, BlackRock may have access to\ncertain fundamental analysis and proprietary\ntechnical models developed by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will not be under any obligation,\nhowever, to effect transactions on behalf of\nthe Fund in accordance with such analysis and\nmodels. In addition, BlackRock will not have\nany obligation to make available any\ninformation regarding its proprietary\nactivities or strategies, or the activities or\nstrategies used for other accounts managed by\nthem, for the benefit of the management of the\nFund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock\nwill have access to such information for the\npurpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary\nactivities or portfolio strategies of\nBlackRock, or the activities or strategies\nused for accounts managed by BlackRock or\nother client accounts could conflict with the\ntransactions and strategies employed by\nBlackRock in managing the Fund. The Fund may\nbe included in investment models developed by\nBlackRock for use by clients and financial\nadvisors. To the extent clients invest in\nthese investment models and increase the\nassets under management of the Fund, the\ninvestment management fee amounts paid by the\nFund to BlackRock may also increase. The\nprice, availability and liquidity of the Fund\nmay be impacted by purchases and sales of the\nFund by model-driven investment portfolios, as\nwell as by BlackRock itself and by its\nadvisory clients. In addition, certain\nprincipals and certain employees of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment adviser are also principals or\nemployees of other business units or entities\nwithin BlackRock. As a result, these\nprincipals and employees may have obligations\nto such other business units or entities or\ntheir clients and such obligations to other\nbusiness units or entities or their clients\nmay be a consideration of which investors in\nthe Fund should be aware. BlackRock may enter\ninto transactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of the\nFund in which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by the Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which the Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non the Fund could potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthe Fund and increased assets under management\nfor BlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Fund or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may from\ntime to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. The Fund may,\nsubject to applicable law, purchase\ninvestments that are the subject of an\nunderwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse to those\nof the Fund. At times, these activities may\ncause business units or entities within\nBlackRock to give advice to clients that may\ncause these clients to take actions adverse to\nthe interests of the Fund. To the extent such\ntransactions are permitted, the Fund will deal\nwith BlackRock on an arm\u2019s-length basis. To\nthe extent authorized by applicable law,\nBlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent,\nlender or adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund. It is anticipated\nthat the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs,\nfinancial advisory fees, underwriting and\nplacement fees, sales fees, financing and\ncommitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees,\ncompensation or\n\n50\n\nprofits, rates, terms and conditions charged\nby BlackRock will be in its view commercially\nreasonable, although BlackRock, including its\nsales personnel, will have an interest in\nobtaining fees and other amounts that are\nfavorable to BlackRock and such sales\npersonnel, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund. Index based funds may use an index\nprovider that is affiliated with another\nservice provider of the Fund or BlackRock that\nacts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in\nother commercial capacities for the Fund or\nBlackRock. Subject to applicable law,\nBlackRock (and its personnel and other\ndistributors) will be entitled to retain fees\nand other amounts that they receive in\nconnection with their service to the Fund as\nbroker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in\nother commercial capacities. No accounting to\nthe Fund or its shareholders will be required,\nand no fees or other compensation payable by\nthe Fund or its shareholders will be reduced\nby reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such\nfees or other amounts. When BlackRock acts as\nbroker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other\ncommercial capacities in relation to the Fund,\nBlackRock may take commercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund. The Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund's own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with the Fund's establishment of\nits business relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund's counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund's creditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFund. BlackRock will also receive compensation\nfor managing the reinvestment of the cash\ncollateral from securities lending. There are\npotential conflicts of interests in managing a\nsecurities lending program, including but not\nlimited to: (i) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to, among\nother things, increase or decrease the amount\nof securities on loan or to lend particular\nsecurities in order to generate additional\nrisk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its\naffiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to\nallocate loans to clients that would provide\nmore revenue to BlackRock. As described\nfurther below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate\nthis conflict by providing its securities\nlending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Fund and certain other clients\nand/or funds against a shortfall in collateral\nin the event of borrower default. On a regular\nbasis, BlackRock calculates the potential\ndollar exposure of collateral shortfall\nresulting from a borrower default ( \u201c\nshortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e., indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a loan opportunity arrives; and\n(iii) the lending portfolio must also have\nenough inventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. BlackRock may decline to\nmake a securities loan on behalf of the Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of the Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of the\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for the Fund may\nbe bunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio\n\n51\n\nmanagement decisions for different accounts\nare made separately, or if they determine that\nbunching or aggregating is not practicable or\nrequired, or in cases involving client\ndirection. Prevailing trading activity\nfrequently may make impossible the receipt of\nthe same price or execution on the entire\nvolume of securities purchased or sold. When\nthis occurs, the various prices may be\naveraged, and the Fund will be charged or\ncredited with the average price. Thus, the\neffect of the aggregation may operate on some\noccasions to the disadvantage of the Fund. In\naddition, under certain circumstances, the\nFund will not be charged the same commission\nor commission equivalent rates in connection\nwith a bunched or aggregated order. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock may select brokers\nthat furnish BlackRock, the Fund, other\nBlackRock client accounts or personnel,\ndirectly or through correspondent\nrelationships, with research or other\nappropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Fund and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the Fund\nbased on the amount of brokerage commissions\npaid by the Fund and such other BlackRock\nclient accounts. For example, research or\nother services that are paid for through one\nclient's commissions may not be used in\nmanaging that client's account. In addition,\nother BlackRock client accounts may receive\nthe benefit, including disproportionate\nbenefits, of economies of scale or price\ndiscounts in connection with products and\nservices that may be provided to the Fund and\nto such other BlackRock client accounts. To\nthe extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars,\nit will not have to pay for those products and\nservices itself. BlackRock does not currently\nenter into arrangements to use the Fund's\nassets for, or participate in, soft dollars,\nalthough BlackRock may receive research that\nis bundled with the trade execution, clearing,\nand/or settlement services provided by a\nparticular broker-dealer. To the extent that\nBlackRock receives research on this basis,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. For\nexample, the research effectively will be paid\nby client commissions that also will be used\nto pay for the execution, clearing, and\nsettlement services provided by the broker-\ndealer and will not be paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable\nlaw, may endeavor to execute trades through\nbrokers who, pursuant to such arrangements,\nprovide research or other services in order to\nensure the continued receipt of research or\nother services BlackRock believes are useful\nin its investment decision-making process.\nBlackRock may from time to time choose not to\nengage in the above described arrangements to\nvarying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited\nby applicable law, may also enter into\ncommission sharing arrangements under which\nBlackRock may execute transactions through a\nbroker-dealer, and request that the broker-\ndealer allocate a portion of the commissions\nor commission credits to another firm that\nprovides research to BlackRock. To the extent\nthat BlackRock engages in commission sharing\narrangements, many of the same conflicts\nrelated to traditional soft dollars may exist.\nBlackRock may utilize certain electronic\ncrossing networks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including,\nwithout limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock\nhas an investment or other interest, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law) in\nexecuting client securities transactions for\ncertain types of securities. These ECNs may\ncharge fees for their services, including\naccess fees and transaction fees. The\ntransaction fees, which are similar to\ncommissions or markups/markdowns, will\ngenerally be charged to clients and, like\ncommissions and markups/markdowns, would\ngenerally be included in the cost of the\nsecurities purchased. Access fees may be paid\nby BlackRock even though incurred in\nconnection with executing transactions on\nbehalf of clients, including the Fund. In\ncertain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume\ndiscounts that will reduce the access fees\ntypically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nonly utilize ECNs consistent with its\nobligation to seek to obtain best execution in\nclient transactions. BlackRock owns a minority\ninterest in, and is a member of, Members\nExchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly created U.S.\nstock exchange. Transactions for the Fund may\nbe executed on MEMX if third party brokers\nselect MEMX as the appropriate venue for\nexecution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of such Funds. In addition,\ntransactions in Fund shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the\nappropriate venue for the execution of such\norders. BlackRock has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent conflicts of\ninterest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Fund, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock's fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\n\n52\n\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee the Proxy Voting Policy section of this\nSAI. It is also possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of\nthe Fund. Increasing the Fund\u2019s assets may\nenhance liquidity, investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the\nright, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw, to sell into the market or redeem in\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of the Fund acquired for its own\naccounts or the account of a BlackRock\nadvisory client. A large sale or redemption of\nshares of the Fund by BlackRock itself or a\nBlackRock advisory client could significantly\nreduce the asset size of the Fund, which might\nhave an adverse effect on the Fund's\nliquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio\ndiversification, expense ratio or ability to\ncomply with the listing requirements for the\nFund. It is possible that the Fund may invest\nin securities of, or engage in transactions\nwith, companies in which BlackRock has\nsignificant debt or equity investments or\nother interests. The Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured notes) by\nentities for which BlackRock provides and is\ncompensated for cash management services\nrelating to the proceeds from the sale of such\nissuances. In making investment decisions for\nthe Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain\nor use material non-public information\nacquired by any unit of BlackRock in the\ncourse of these activities. In addition, from\ntime to time, the activities of BlackRock may\nlimit the Fund's flexibility in purchases and\nsales of securities. As indicated below,\nBlackRock may engage in transactions with\ncompanies in which BlackRock-advised funds or\nother clients of BlackRock have an investment.\nBlackRock, its personnel and other financial\nservice providers may have interests in\npromoting sales of the Fund. With respect to\nBlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration\nand profitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Fund or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFund or its shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFund may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or the Fund, may\nsponsor events (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to the Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients'\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\nthe Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other data sources unavailable to the\nFund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will\ngenerally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to the Fund's\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund's pricing\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan the valuation for such security or\ninvestment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock. As disclosed in more detail in the\nDetermination of Net Asset Value section in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value by BFA. BFA has been designated\nas the Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBFA pricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that the Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be\n\n53\n\nbased on analytical values determined by BFA\nusing proprietary or third-party valuation\nmodels, fair value represents only a good\nfaith approximation of the value of an asset\nor liability. The fair value of one or more\nassets or liabilities may not, in retrospect,\nbe the price at which those assets or\nliabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, the Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, the Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in the Fund\nbearing some additional expenses. BlackRock\nand its directors, officers and employees, may\nbuy and sell securities or other investments\nfor their own accounts and may have conflicts\nof interest with respect to investments made\non behalf of the Fund. As a result of\ndiffering trading and investment strategies or\nconstraints, positions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees that are the\nsame, different from or made at different\ntimes than positions taken for the Fund. To\nlessen the possibility that the Fund will be\nadversely affected by this personal trading,\nthe Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted\na code of ethics in compliance with Section\n17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts\nsecurities trading in the personal accounts of\ninvestment professionals and others who\nnormally come into possession of information\nregarding the Fund's portfolio transactions.\nEach code of ethics is available by contacting\nBlackRock at the telephone number on the back\ncover of the Fund\u2019s Prospectus or by accessing\nthe EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site\nat http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\nthe Fund, except that the Fund may in\naccordance with rules or guidance adopted\nunder the 1940 Act engage in transactions with\nanother Fund or accounts that are affiliated\nwith the Fund as a result of common officers,\ndirectors, or investment advisers or pursuant\nto exemptive orders granted to the Fund and/or\nBlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would\nbe effected in circumstances in which\nBlackRock determined that it would be\nappropriate for the Fund to purchase and\nanother client of BlackRock to sell, or the\nFund to sell and another client of BlackRock\nto purchase, the same security or instrument\non the same day. From time to time, the\nactivities of the Fund may be restricted\nbecause of regulatory requirements applicable\nto BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal\npolicies designed to comply with, limit the\napplicability of, or otherwise relate to such\nrequirements. A client not advised by\nBlackRock would not be subject to some of\nthose considerations. There may be periods\nwhen BlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of the Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which the Fund wishes to\npurchase or sell. However, if permitted by\napplicable law, and where consistent with\nBlackRock\u2019s policies and procedures (including\nthe necessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Fund may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Fund. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Fund invests in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or is\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invests in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Fund) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Fund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or the Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Fund), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As\n\n54\n\na result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients\n(including the Fund), may limit purchases,\nsell existing investments, or otherwise\nrestrict, forgo or limit the exercise of\nrights (including transferring, outsourcing or\nlimiting voting rights or forgoing the right\nto receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its\nsole discretion, deems it appropriate in light\nof potential regulatory or other restrictions\non ownership or other consequences resulting\nfrom reaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Fund),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations. In addition to the\nforegoing, other ownership thresholds may\ntrigger reporting requirements to governmental\nand regulatory authorities, and such reports\nmay entail the disclosure of the identity of a\nclient or BlackRock\u2019s intended strategy with\nrespect to such security or asset. BlackRock\nmay not serve as an Authorized Participant in\nthe creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.\nBlackRock may maintain securities indices. To\nthe extent permitted by applicable laws, the\nFund may seek to license and use such indices\nas part of its investment strategy. Index\nbased funds that seek to track the performance\nof securities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Fund using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to the\nFund and the Fund is under no obligation to\nuse BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters\ninto a license for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to the Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to the\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Fund,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to the Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to the Fund, or the\nselection of such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by the Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Fund, that engage the\nservice provider (typically the custodian).\nThe Fund\u2019s service provider remunerates\nBlackRock for the use of the systems. The Fund\nservice provider\u2019s payments to BlackRock for\nthe use of these systems may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock.\n\n55\n\nBlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a service\nprovider in connection with the use of systems\nprovided by BlackRock may create an incentive\nfor BlackRock to recommend that the Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider. In recognition of a BlackRock\nclient\u2019s overall relationship with BlackRock,\nBlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in the Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock (including BFA), its\ndirectors, officers and employees, in addition\nto those described in this section, may give\nrise to additional conflicts of interest.\nInvestment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services Investment Adviser. BFA\nserves as investment adviser to the Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, and\nBFA. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is\nregistered as an investment adviser under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nUnder the investment advisory agreement, BFA,\nsubject to the supervision of the Board and in\nconformity with the stated investment policies\nof the Fund, manages and administers the Trust\nand the investment of the Fund\u2019s assets. BFA\nis responsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the investment advisory agreement, BFA may,\nfrom time to time, in its sole discretion and\nto the extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to the Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. BFA is\nresponsible, under the investment advisory\nagreement, for substantially all expenses of\nthe Fund, including the cost of transfer\nagency, custody, fund administration, legal,\naudit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Fund will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees).BFA may from time to time\nvoluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary\nwaiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by\nBFA at any time. For its investment advisory\nservices to the Fund, BFA is paid a management\nfee by the Fund, based on a percentage of the\nFund\u2019s average daily net assets, at an annual\nrate of 0.35%. The investment advisory\nagreement with respect to the Fund continues\nin effect for two years from its effective\ndate, and thereafter is subject to annual\napproval by (i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of\na majority of the outstanding voting\nsecurities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, provided that in either event such\ncontinuance also is approved by a majority of\nthe Board members who are not interested\npersons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, by a vote cast in person at a meeting\ncalled for the purpose of voting on such\napproval. The investment advisory agreement\nwith respect to the Fund is terminable without\npenalty, on 60 days\u2019 notice, by the Board or\nby a vote of the holders of a majority of the\nFund\u2019s outstanding voting securities (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act). The investment\nadvisory agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays\u2019 notice by BFA and will terminate\nautomatically in the event of its assignment\n(as defined in the 1940 Act). Portfolio\nManagers. As of August 31, 2023, the\nindividuals named as Portfolio Managers in the\nFund's Prospectus were also primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nother iShares funds and certain other types of\nportfolios and/or accounts as follows:\n\n56\n                                              \n  Jennifer Hsui                               \n  Types of         Number              Total  \n  Accounts                            Assets  \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          333  $2,020,183,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment            1      4,461,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts       19     34,143,000,000  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n  Types of         Number              Total  \n  Accounts                            Assets  \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          286  $1,906,774,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment           37      9,687,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts       54      4,289,000,000  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul Whitehead                              \n  Types of         Number              Total  \n  Accounts                            Assets  \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          341  $2,022,190,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment          337  1,014,501,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts      165    666,598,000,000  \n                                              \nPursuant to BFA\u2019s policy, investment\nopportunities are allocated equitably among\nthe Fund and other portfolios and accounts.\nFor example, under certain circumstances, an\ninvestment opportunity may be restricted due\nto limited supply in the market, legal\nconstraints or other factors, in which event\nthe investment opportunity will be allocated\nequitably among those portfolios and accounts,\nincluding the Fund, seeking such investment\nopportunity. As a consequence, from time to\ntime the Fund may receive a smaller allocation\nof an investment opportunity than it would\nhave if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its\naffiliates did not manage other portfolios or\naccounts. Like the Fund, the other portfolios\nor accounts for which the Portfolio Managers\nare primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management generally pay an asset-\nbased fee to BFA or its affiliates, as\napplicable, for its advisory services. One or\nmore of those other portfolios or accounts,\nhowever, may pay BFA or its affiliates a\nperformance-based fee in lieu of, or in\naddition to, an asset-based fee for its\nadvisory services. A portfolio or account with\na performance-based fee would pay BFA or its\naffiliates a portion of that portfolio\u2019s or\naccount\u2019s gains, or would pay BFA or its\naffiliates more for its services than would\notherwise be the case if BFA or any of its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Fund should be aware that,\nas with any group of portfolios and accounts\nmanaged by an investment adviser and/or its\naffiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below show, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of August 31, 2023:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n57\n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts        Performance   Total Assets  \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1  $2,396,000,0\u2026  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of December 4, 2023.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance. As of December 4, 2023,\nthe Portfolio Managers did not beneficially\nown shares of the Fund. Codes of Ethics. The\nTrust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted\ncodes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under\nthe 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit\npersonnel subject to the codes of ethics to\ninvest in securities, subject to certain\nlimitations, including securities that may be\npurchased or held by the Fund. Each code of\nethics is available by contacting BlackRock at\nthe telephone number on the back cover of the\nFund\u2019s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR\nDatabase on the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. Anti-Money\nLaundering Requirements. The Fund is subject\nto the USA PATRIOT Act (the \u201c Patriot Act \u201d ).\nThe Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use\nof the U.S. financial system in furtherance of\nmoney laundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Pursuant to requirements under the\nPatriot Act, the Fund may request information\nfrom Authorized Participants to enable it to\nform a reasonable belief that it knows the\ntrue identity of its Authorized Participants.\nThis information will be used to verify the\nidentity of Authorized Participants or, in\nsome cases, the status of financial\nprofessionals; it will be used only for\ncompliance with the requirements of the\nPatriot Act. The Fund reserves the right to\nreject purchase orders from persons who have\nnot submitted information sufficient to allow\nthe Fund to verify their identity. The Fund\nalso reserves the right to redeem any amounts\nin the Fund from persons whose identity it is\nunable to verify on a timely basis. It is the\nFund's policy to cooperate fully with\nappropriate regulators in any investigations\nconducted with respect to potential money\nlaundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities.\n\n58\n\nAdministrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent.\nState Street Bank and Trust Company ( \u201c State\nStreet \u201d ) serves as administrator, custodian\nand transfer agent for the Fund under the\nMaster Services Agreement and related Service\nSchedule (the \u201c Service Module \u201d ). State\nStreet\u2019s principal address is One Congress\nStreet, Suite 1, Boston, MA 02114-2016.\nPursuant to the Service Module for Fund\nAdministration and Accounting Services with\nthe Trust, State Street provides necessary\nadministrative, legal, tax and accounting and\nfinancial reporting services for the\nmaintenance and operations of the Trust and\nthe Fund. In addition, State Street makes\navailable the office space, equipment,\npersonnel and facilities required to provide\nsuch services. Pursuant to the Service Module\nfor Custodial Services with the Trust, State\nStreet maintains, in separate accounts, cash,\nsecurities and other assets of the Trust and\nthe Fund, keeps all necessary accounts and\nrecords and provides other services. State\nStreet is required, upon the order of the\nTrust, to deliver securities held by State\nStreet and to make payments for securities\npurchased by the Trust for the Fund. State\nStreet is authorized to appoint certain\nforeign custodians or foreign custody managers\nfor Fund investments outside the U.S. Pursuant\nto the Service Module for Transfer Agency\nServices with the Trust, State Street acts as\na transfer agent for the Fund\u2019s authorized and\nissued shares of beneficial interest, and as\ndividend disbursing agent of the Trust. As\ncompensation for these services, State Street\nreceives certain out-of-pocket costs,\ntransaction fees and asset-based fees which\nare accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA from\nits management fee. JPMorgan serves as\ncustodian for the Fund in connection with\ncertain securities lending activities under a\nCustody Services Agreement. JPMorgan\u2019s\nprincipal address is 383 Madison Avenue, 11 th\nFloor, New York, NY 10179. Pursuant to the\nCustody Services Agreement with BTC and the\nTrust, JPMorgan provides custody and related\nservices required to facilitate securities\nlending by the Fund. JPMorgan maintains\ncustody as may be necessary to facilitate Fund\nsecurities lending activity in coordination\nwith other funds, maintains custodial records\nand provides other services. As compensation\nfor these services, JPMorgan receives certain\nfees and expenses paid by BTC from its\ncompensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Distributor. The Distributor's\nprincipal address is 50 Hudson Yards, New\nYork, NY 10001. Shares are continuously\noffered for sale by the Fund through the\nDistributor or its agent only in Creation\nUnits, as described in the Prospectus and\nbelow in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI. Fund\nshares in amounts less than Creation Units are\ngenerally not distributed by the Distributor\nor its agent. The Distributor or its agent\nwill arrange for the delivery of the\nProspectus and, upon request, this SAI to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nor its agents and confirmations of acceptance\nfurnished by it or its agents. The Distributor\nis a broker-dealer registered under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.\n( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor is also\nlicensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S.\nstates, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands and the District of Columbia.\nThe Distribution Agreement for the Fund\nprovides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii)\nthe vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the Fund. The Distribution Agreement will\nterminate automatically in the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act). The\nDistributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers\n\u201d ) who will solicit purchases of Creation\nUnits of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers\nmay also be Authorized Participants (as\ndescribed below), Depository Trust Company ( \u201c\nDTC \u201d ) participants and/or investor services\norganizations. BFA or its affiliates may, from\ntime to time and from its own resources, pay,\ndefray or absorb costs relating to\ndistribution, including payments out of its\nown resources to the Distributor, or to\notherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that the\nFund engages in securities lending, the Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund, subject\nto the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to\na written agreement (the \u201c Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement \u201d ). The Fund retains a\nportion of the securities lending income and\nremits the remaining portion to BTC as\ncompensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Securities lending income is\ngenerally equal to the total of income earned\nfrom the reinvestment of cash collateral (and\nexcludes collateral investment fees as defined\nbelow), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. As securities\nlending agent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. The\nFund is responsible for fees in connection\nwith the investment of cash collateral\nreceived for securities on loan in a money\nmarket fund managed by BFA (the \u201c collateral\ninvestment fees \u201d ); however, BTC has agreed\nto reduce the amount of securities lending\nincome it receives in order to effectively\nlimit the collateral\n\n59\n\ninvestment fees the Fund bears to an annual\nrate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares\nwill not be subject to a sales load,\nredemption fee, distribution fee or service\nfee. Under the securities lending program, the\nFund is categorized into one of several\nspecific asset classes. The determination of\nthe Fund\u2019s asset class category (fixed-income,\ndomestic equity, international equity or fund-\nof-funds), each of which may be subject to a\ndifferent fee arrangement, is based on a\nmethodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.\nPursuant to the current Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement: (i) international equity\nfunds, such as the Fund, retain 82% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees), and (ii) this\namount can never be less than 70% of the sum\nof securities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees. In addition, commencing the\nbusiness day following the date that the\naggregate securities lending income (which\nincludes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex (as defined in the\nManagement \u2014 Trustees and Officers section of\nthis SAI) in a calendar year exceeds a\nspecified threshold, each applicable\ninternational equity fund, pursuant to the\ncurrent Securities Lending Agency Agreement,\nwill receive for the remainder of that\ncalendar year securities lending income as\nfollows: (i) 85% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees);\nand (ii) this amount can never be less than\n70% of the sum of securities lending income\nplus collateral investment fees. Because the\nFund is newly launched, no services have been\nprovided by BTC as the Fund\u2019s securities\nlending agent, and the Fund had no income and\nfees/compensation related to securities\nlending activities for the fiscal year ended\nAugust 31, 2023. Payments by BFA and its\nAffiliates. BFA and/or its affiliates ( \u201c BFA\nEntities \u201d ) may pay certain broker-dealers,\nregistered investment advisers, banks and\nother financial intermediaries ( \u201c\nIntermediaries \u201d ) for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products in general. BFA\nEntities make these payments from their own\nassets and not from the assets of the Fund.\nAlthough a portion of BFA Entities\u2019 revenue\ncomes directly or indirectly in part from fees\npaid by the Fund, other iShares funds\n(including, if applicable, any underlying\niShares funds held by a Fund) or exchange-\ntraded products, these payments do not\nincrease the price paid by investors for the\npurchase of shares of, or the cost of owning,\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. BFA Entities make payments\nfor Intermediaries\u2019 participation in\nactivities that are designed to make\nregistered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Fund and other iShares funds, or\nfor other activities, such as participation in\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products ( \u201c\nPublishing Costs \u201d ). In addition, BFA\nEntities make payments to Intermediaries that\nmake shares of the Fund, other iShares funds\nor exchange-traded products available to their\nclients, in some cases at a waived or reduced\ncommission rate or ticket charge, develop new\nproducts that feature iShares, create\neducational content about the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products that\nis featured on an Intermediary\u2019s platform, or\notherwise promote the Fund, other iShares\nfunds and exchange-traded products. BFA\nEntities may also reimburse expenses or make\npayments from their own assets to\nIntermediaries or other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\niShares business or facilitate investment in\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. Payments of the type\ndescribed above are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products, or otherwise promote\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm.\n\n60\n\nIn addition to the payments described above,\nBFA Entities have developed proprietary tools,\ncalculators and related interactive or digital\ncontent that is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Fund, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream\nFund Centre AG, Commonwealth Equity Services,\nLLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC,\nE*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset\nManagement, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc.,\nLPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\nFenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley\nSmith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual\nInvestment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio\nSolutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public Holdings,\nInc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.,\nRiskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC,\nStash Investments LLC, TD Ameritrade, Inc.,\nUBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo\nAdvisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFund, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Fund, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Fund may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Fund would pay a fee\nto the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of the Fund to enhance the\nliquidity and quality of the secondary market\nof securities of the Fund. The fee would then\nbe credited by the exchange to one or more\nmarket makers that meet or exceed liquidity\nand market quality standards with respect to\nthe securities of the Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of the\nFund solely for the benefit of the Fund and\nwill not be paid from any Fund assets. Other\nfunds managed by BFA may also participate in\nsuch programs.\n\n61\n\nDetermination of Net Asset Value Valuation of\nShares. The NAV for the Fund is generally\ncalculated as of the close of regular trading\nhours on the New York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE\n\u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each\nbusiness day the NYSE is open. Valuation of\nassets held by the Fund is as follows: Equity\nInvestments. Equity securities traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange ( e.g. , NYSE),\non separate trading boards of a securities\nexchange or through a market system that\nprovides contemporaneous transaction pricing\ninformation (each an \u201c Exchange \u201d ) are valued\nusing information obtained via independent\npricing services, generally at the closing\nprice or, if an Exchange closing price is not\navailable, the last traded price on that\nExchange prior to the time as of which the\nassets or liabilities are valued. However,\nunder certain circumstances, other means of\ndetermining current market value may be used.\nIf an equity security is traded on more than\none Exchange, the current market value of the\nsecurity where it is primarily traded\ngenerally will be used. In the event that\nthere are no sales involving an equity\nsecurity held by the Fund on a day on which\nthe Fund values such security, the prior day\u2019s\nprice will be used, unless BFA determines that\nsuch prior day\u2019s price no longer reflects the\nfair value of the security, in which case such\nasset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset\n(as defined below). Options, Futures, Swaps\nand Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded equity\noptions (except those that are customized) for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by the Fund on a day on which the Fund\nvalues such option, the last bid (long\npositions) or ask (short positions) price, if\navailable, will be used as the value of such\noption. If no bid or ask price is available on\na day on which the Fund values such option,\nthe prior day\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value the Fund\u2019s securities and\nother assets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time the Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich the Fund valued such security, the\nrevised pricing service quotation generally\nwill be applied prospectively. Such\ndetermination will be made considering\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding\nthe revision. The price the Fund could receive\nupon the sale of any particular portfolio\ninvestment may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the investment, particularly for\nassets that trade in thin or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair valuation\nmethodology or a price provided by an\nindependent pricing service. As a result, the\nprice received upon the sale of an investment\nmay be less than the value ascribed by the\nFund, and the Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain upon the sale of the investment. The\nFund\u2019s ability to value its investment may\nalso be impacted by technological issues\nand/or errors by pricing services or other\nthird-party service providers. All cash,\nreceivables and current payables are carried\non the Fund\u2019s books at their fair value. In\nthe event that application of the methods of\nvaluation discussed above result in a price\nfor a security which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, the Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by the Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates.\n\n62\n\nUse of fair value prices and certain current\nmarket valuations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate the\nFund\u2019s NAV and the prices used in the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn, could result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the Underlying Index.\nFair Value. When market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.\nOn any day the NYSE is open and a foreign\nmarket or the primary exchange on which a\nforeign asset or liability is traded is\nclosed, such asset or liability will be valued\nusing the prior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA\nis not aware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. For certain foreign assets, a third-\nparty vendor supplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the movement of\na proprietary multi-factor model after the\nrelevant foreign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing methodology is\ndesigned to correlate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S. markets\nfollowing the close of the local markets to\nthe prices that might have prevailed as of a\nFund\u2019s pricing time. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee\nis responsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition,\nthe Fund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of the Fund. The pricing of all\nFair Value Assets is subsequently reported to\nthe Board or a committee thereof. When\ndetermining the price for a Fair Value Asset,\nBFA will seek to determine the price that the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive from\nthe current sale of that asset or liability in\nan arm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on\nwhich the asset or liability is being valued,\nand does not seek to determine the price the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive for\nselling an asset or liability at a later time\nor if it holds the asset or liability to\nmaturity. Fair value determinations will be\nbased upon all available factors that BFA\ndeems relevant at the time of the\ndetermination, and may be based on analytical\nvalues determined by BFA using proprietary or\nthird-party valuation models. Fair value\nrepresents a good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset or liability. When\ndetermining the fair value of an investment,\none or more fair value methodologies may be\nused (depending on certain factors, including\nthe asset type). For example, the investment\nmay be initially priced based on the original\ncost of the investment or, alternatively,\nusing proprietary or third-party models that\nmay rely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nThe Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements.\n\n63\n\nGenerally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules\napplicable to funds and various assets in\nwhich they invest are evolving. Such changes\nmay adversely affect the Fund. For example,\nthe evolution of rules governing the\ndetermination of the fair market value of\nassets or liabilities, to the extent such\nrules become more stringent, would tend to\nincrease the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to the Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Fund,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, the Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including the\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause the Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for the Fund and may take into\naccount a variety of factors including: (i)\nthe size, nature and character of the security\nor instrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time,\nthe Fund may purchase new issues of securities\nin a fixed price offering. In these\nsituations, the broker may be a member of the\nselling group that will, in addition to\nselling securities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). The\nFund anticipates that brokerage transactions\ninvolving foreign equity securities generally\nwill be conducted primarily on the principal\nstock exchanges of the applicable country.\nForeign equity securities may be held by the\nFund in the form of depositary receipts, or\nother securities convertible into foreign\nequity securities. Depositary receipts may be\nlisted on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC\nmarkets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may\nbe. ADRs, like other securities traded in the\nU.S., will be subject to negotiated commission\nrates. OTC issues, including most fixed-income\nsecurities such as corporate debt and U.S.\nGovernment securities, are normally traded on\na \u201c net \u201d basis without a stated commission,\nthrough dealers acting for their own account\nand not as brokers. The Fund will primarily\nengage in transactions with these dealers or\ndeal directly with the issuer unless a better\nprice or execution could be obtained by using\na broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit.\n\n64\n\nUnder the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with\nthe Fund and persons who are affiliated with\nsuch affiliated persons are prohibited from\ndealing with the Fund as principal in the\npurchase and sale of securities unless a\npermissive order allowing such transactions is\nobtained from the SEC. Since transactions in\nthe OTC market usually involve transactions\nwith the dealers acting as principal for their\nown accounts, the Fund will not deal with\naffiliated persons and affiliated persons of\nsuch affiliated persons in connection with\nsuch transactions. The Fund will not purchase\nsecurities during the existence of any\nunderwriting or selling group relating to such\nsecurities of which BFA, BRIL or any\naffiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nthereof is a member except pursuant to\nprocedures adopted by the Board in accordance\nwith Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act. Purchases\nof money market instruments by the Fund are\nmade from dealers, underwriters and issuers.\nThe Fund does not currently expect to incur\nany brokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Fund\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Fund may invest. Initial public\nofferings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of securities may be\nover-subscribed and subsequently trade at a\npremium in the secondary market. When BFA is\ngiven an opportunity to invest in such an\ninitial offering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue,\nthe supply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in the Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well.\n\n65\n\nBecause different accounts may have differing\ninvestment objectives and policies, BFA may\nbuy and sell the same securities at the same\ntime for different clients based on the\nparticular investment objective, guidelines\nand strategies of those accounts. For example,\nBFA may decide that it may be entirely\nappropriate for a growth fund to sell a\nsecurity at the same time a value fund is\nbuying that security. To the extent that\ntransactions on behalf of more than one client\nof BFA or the other Affiliates during the same\nperiod increase the demand for securities\nbeing purchased or the supply of securities\nbeing sold, there may be an adverse effect on\nprice. For example, sales of a security by\nBlackRock on behalf of one or more of its\nclients may decrease the market price of such\nsecurity, adversely impacting other BlackRock\nclients that still hold the security. If\npurchases or sales of securities arise for\nconsideration at or about the same time that\nwould involve the Fund or other clients or\nfunds for which BFA or another Affiliate act\nas investment manager, transactions in such\nsecurities will be made, insofar as feasible,\nfor the respective funds and clients in a\nmanner deemed equitable to all. In certain\ninstances, BFA may find it efficient for\npurposes of seeking to obtain best execution,\nto aggregate or \u201c bunch \u201d certain\ncontemporaneous purchases or sale orders of\nits advisory accounts and advisory accounts of\naffiliates. In general, all contemporaneous\ntrades for client accounts under management by\nthe same portfolio manager or investment team\nwill be bunched in a single order if the\ntrader believes the bunched trade would\nprovide each client with an opportunity to\nachieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Fund is concerned,\nin other cases it could be beneficial to the\nFund. Transactions effected by BFA or the\nother Affiliates on behalf of more than one of\nits clients during the same period may\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, causing an adverse effect on price. The\ntrader will give the bunched order to the\nbroker-dealer that the trader has identified\nas being able to provide the best execution of\nthe order. Orders for purchase or sale of\nsecurities will be placed within a reasonable\namount of time of the order receipt and\nbunched orders will be kept bunched only long\nenough to execute the order. The Fund's\npurchase and sale orders for securities may be\ncombined with those of other investment\ncompanies, clients or accounts that BlackRock\nmanages or advises. If purchases or sales of\nportfolio securities of the Fund and one or\nmore other accounts managed or advised by\nBlackRock are considered at or about the same\ntime, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Fund and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Fund\nis concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFund. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for\nits own account in the types of securities in\nwhich the Fund may invest. BlackRock may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Fund\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses. Because the Fund\nis newly launched, there is no reportable\nportfolio turnover. Creation or redemption\ntransactions, to the extent consisting of\ncash, may require the Fund to\ncontemporaneously transact with broker-dealers\nfor purchases of Deposit Securities (as\ndefined below under Fund Deposit ) or sales of\nFund Securities (as defined below under\nRedemption of Creation Units ), as applicable.\nSuch transactions with a particular broker-\ndealer may be conditioned upon the broker-\ndealer's agreement to transact at guaranteed\nprice levels in order to reduce transaction\ncosts the Fund would otherwise incur as a\nconsequence of settling creation or redemption\nbaskets in cash rather than in-kind. Following\nthe Fund\u2019s receipt of an order to purchase or\nredeem creation or redemption baskets, to the\nextent such purchases or redemptions consist\nof a cash portion, the Fund will enter an\norder with a broker or dealer to purchase or\nsell the Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities, as applicable. The terms of such\norder may, depending on the timing of the\ntransaction and certain other factors, require\nthe broker or dealer to guarantee that the\nFund will achieve execution of its order at a\nprice at least as favorable to the Fund as the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the Deposit\nSecurities/Fund Securities used for purposes\nof calculating the NAV applied to the creation\nor redemption transaction giving rise to the\norder (the \u201c Execution Performance Guarantee \u201d\n). Such orders may be placed with the\npurchasing or redeeming Authorized Participant\n(or a broker-dealer affiliated with the\nAuthorized Participant or a third-party\nbroker-dealer engaged through the Authorized\nParticipant) in its\n\n66\n\ncapacity as a broker-dealer. The amount\npayable to the Fund in respect of any\nExecution Performance Guarantee will depend on\nthe results achieved by the executing firm and\nwill vary depending on market activity, timing\nand a variety of other factors. The Execution\nPerformance Guarantee will apply for any\norders executed by the Authorized Participant\n(or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-\ndealer), even if the trades have not settled\nbefore the redemption transaction settles. To\nensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee\nwill be honored on orders arising from\ncreation transactions executed by an\nAuthorized Participant (or an affiliated or\nunaffiliated broker-dealer), an Authorized\nParticipant is required to deposit an amount\nwith the Fund (the \u201c Execution Performance\nDeposit \u201d ). If the broker-dealer executing\nthe order achieves executions in market\ntransactions at a price more favorable than\nthe Fund\u2019s valuation of the Deposit\nSecurities, then the Authorized Participant\ngenerally may retain the benefit of the\nfavorable executions, and the Fund will return\nto the Authorized Participant the Execution\nPerformance Deposit. If, however, the broker-\ndealer executing the order is unable to\nachieve executions in market transactions at a\nprice at least equal to the Fund\u2019s valuation\nof the securities, the Fund retains the\nportion of the Execution Performance Deposit\nequal to the full amount of the execution\nshortfall (including any taxes, brokerage\ncommissions or other costs) and may require\nthe Authorized Participant to deposit any\nadditional amount required to cover the full\namount of the actual Execution Performance\nGuarantee. To ensure that an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee will be honored for\nbrokerage orders arising from redemption\ntransactions executed by an Authorized\nParticipant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated\nbroker-dealer) as broker-dealer, an Authorized\nParticipant agrees to pay the shortfall amount\n(the \u201c Execution Performance Offset \u201d ). If\nthe broker-dealer executing the order achieves\nexecutions in market transactions at a price\nmore favorable than the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe Fund Securities, then the Authorized\nParticipant generally may retain the benefit\nof the favorable executions and the Authorized\nParticipant is not called upon to honor the\nExecution Performance Offset. If, however, the\nbroker-dealer is unable to achieve executions\nin market transactions at a price at least\nequal to the Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nsecurities, the Fund will be entitled to the\nportion of the Execution Performance Offset\nequal to the full amount of the execution\nshortfall (including any taxes, brokerage\ncommissions or other costs). The circumstances\nunder which the Execution Performance\nGuarantee will be used and the expected amount\nof any Execution Performance Deposit or\nExecution Performance Offset for the Fund will\nbe disclosed in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time based on the actual experience of\nthe Fund. Additional Information Concerning\nthe Trust Shares. The Trust issues shares of\nbeneficial interests in the funds with no par\nvalue. The Board may designate additional\niShares funds. Each share issued by a fund has\na pro rata interest in the assets of that\nfund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange,\nsubscription or conversion rights and are\nfreely transferable. Each share is entitled to\nparticipate equally in dividends and\ndistributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the relevant fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of such fund on\nliquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Following the creation of the\ninitial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund\nand immediately prior to the commencement of\ntrading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.\n\n67\n\nAbsent an applicable exemption or other relief\nfrom the SEC or its staff, beneficial owners\nof more than 5% of the shares of a fund may be\nsubject to the reporting provisions of Section\n13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules\npromulgated thereunder. In addition, absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a\nfund and beneficial owners of 10% of the\nshares of a fund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be\nsubject to the insider reporting, short-swing\nprofit and short sale provisions of Section 16\nof the 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules\npromulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and\nInsiders should consult with their own legal\ncounsel concerning their obligations under\nSections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and\nexisting guidance provided by the SEC staff.\nIn accordance with the Trust's current\nAgreement and Declaration of Trust (the \u201c\nDeclaration of Trust \u201d ), the Board may,\nwithout shareholder approval (unless such\nshareholder approval is required by the\nDeclaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Fund. Shares of\nthe Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of the\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its\n\n68\n\nnominee. Payments by DTC Participants to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of\nshares held through such DTC Participants will\nbe governed by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with the Fund's\nlaunch, the Fund will be seeded through the\nsale of one or more Creation Units by the Fund\nto one or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof the Fund or the Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor the Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nThe Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\nthe Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund's NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the Listing Exchange closes earlier\nthan normal, the Fund may require orders to be\nplaced earlier in the day. The following table\nsets forth the number of shares of the Fund\nthat constitute a Creation Unit for the Fund\nand the approximate value of such Creation\nUnit as of December 4, 2023:\n                                              \n  Shares                    ApproximateValue  \n  PerCreation Unit   PerCreationUnit (U.S.$)  \n  80,000                          $2,000,000  \n                                              \nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of\nthe Fund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation\nUnit. The Board reserves the right to declare\na split or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of the Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board.\n\n69\n\nA \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to the Fund is\nany day the Fund is open for business,\nincluding any day when it satisfies redemption\nrequests as required by Section 22(e) of the\n1940 Act. The Fund is open for business any\nday on which the Listing Exchange on which the\nFund is listed for trading is open for\nbusiness. As of the date of this SAI, the\nListing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of the Fund\ngenerally consists of Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component computed as described\nbelow. Together, the Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component constitute the \u201c Fund\nDeposit, \u201d which, when combined with the\nFund\u2019s portfolio securities is designed to\ngenerate performance that has a collective\ninvestment profile similar to that of the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents\nthe minimum initial and subsequent investment\namount for a Creation Unit of the Fund. Such\nFund Deposit is applicable, subject to any\nadjustments as described below, to purchases\nof Creation Units of shares of the Fund until\nsuch time as the next-announced Fund Deposit\nis made available. The \u201c Cash Component \u201d is\nan amount equal to the difference between the\nNAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the\n\u201c Deposit Amount, \u201d which is an amount equal\nto the market value of the Deposit Securities,\nand serves to compensate for any differences\nbetween the NAV per Creation Unit and the\nDeposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities are the sole responsibility\nof the Authorized Participant purchasing the\nCreation Unit. The Fund generally offers\nCreation Units partially for cash, but may, in\ncertain circumstances, offer Creation Units\nsolely for cash or solely in-kind. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit\nSecurities change pursuant to changes in the\ncomposition of the Fund's portfolio and as\nrebalancing adjustments and corporate action\nevents are reflected from time to time by BFA\nwith a view to the investment objective of the\nFund. The composition of the Deposit\nSecurities may also change in response to\nadjustments to the weighting or composition of\nthe component securities constituting the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund Deposit may also be\nmodified to minimize the Cash Component by\nredistributing the cash to the Deposit\nSecurities portion of the Fund Deposit through\n\u201c systematic rounding. \u201d The rounding\nmethodology \u201c rounds up \u201d position sizes of\nsecurities in the Deposit Securities (which in\nturn reduces the cash portion). However, the\nmethodology limits the maximum allowed\npercentage change in weight and share quantity\nof any given security in the Fund Deposit.\nFund Deposits may also be modified to position\na fund towards a forward index rebalance to\nreflect revisions that account for index\nadditions, deletions, and re-weights. The\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the\nCash Component to replace any Deposit Security\nin certain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by the Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit full cash purchases of Creation Units\nof its funds, when partial or full cash\npurchases of Creation Units are available or\nspecified (Creation Units of the Fund are\ngenerally offered partially for cash), they\nwill be effected in essentially the same\nmanner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the\ncase of a partial or full cash purchase, the\nAuthorized Participant must pay the cash\nequivalent of the Deposit Securities it would\notherwise be required to provide through an\nin-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nThe Authorized Participant will also be\nrequired to pay certain transaction fees and\ncharges for cash purchases, as described\nbelow, and, if transacting as broker with the\nFund, may be required to cover certain\nbrokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution\nand price movement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Fund, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a\n\n70\n\nclearing agency registered with the SEC which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows such\nmember or participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of Creation Units is\nreferred to as an \u201c Authorized Participant. \u201d\nAll shares of the Fund, however created, will\nbe entered on the records of DTC in the name\nof Cede & Co. for the account of a DTC\nParticipant. Role of the Authorized\nParticipant. Creation Units may be purchased\nonly by or through a member or participant of\na clearing agency registered with the SEC,\nwhich has a written agreement with the Fund or\none of its service providers that allows such\nmember or participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of Creation Units (an\n\u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ). Such Authorized\nParticipant will agree, pursuant to the terms\nof such Authorized Participant Agreement and\non behalf of itself or any investor on whose\nbehalf it will act, to certain conditions,\nincluding that such Authorized Participant\nwill make available in advance of each\npurchase of shares an amount of cash\nsufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the\nNAV of a Creation Unit is next determined\nafter receipt of the purchase order in proper\nform, together with the transaction fees\ndescribed below. An Authorized Participant,\nacting on behalf of an investor, may require\nthe investor to enter into an agreement with\nsuch Authorized Participant with respect to\ncertain matters, including payment of the Cash\nComponent. Investors who are not Authorized\nParticipants must make appropriate\narrangements with an Authorized Participant.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not be a DTC Participant\nor may not have executed an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and that orders to\npurchase Creation Units may have to be placed\nby the investor's broker through an Authorized\nParticipant. As a result, purchase orders\nplaced through an Authorized Participant may\nresult in additional charges to such investor.\nThe Trust does not expect to enter into an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement with more\nthan a small number of DTC Participants. A\nlist of current Authorized Participants may be\nobtained from the Distributor. The Distributor\nhas adopted guidelines regarding Authorized\nParticipants\u2019 transactions in Creation Units\nthat are made available to all Authorized\nParticipants. These guidelines set forth the\nprocesses and standards for Authorized\nParticipants to transact with the Distributor\nand its agents in connection with creation and\nredemption transactions. In addition, the\nDistributor may be appointed as the proxy of\nthe Authorized Participant and may be granted\na power of attorney under its Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Purchase Orders. To\ninitiate an order for a Creation Unit, an\nAuthorized Participant must submit to the\nDistributor or its agent an irrevocable order\nto purchase shares of the Fund, in proper\nform, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day to receive that day\u2019s NAV.\nThe Distributor or its agent will notify BFA\nand the custodian of such order. The custodian\nwill then provide such information to any\nappropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and\nrequirements governing the delivery of the\nFund Deposit are set forth in the procedures\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Investors, other\nthan Authorized Participants, are responsible\nfor making arrangements for a creation request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFund, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Fund to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\ndeadline for cash transfers by contacting the\noperations department of the broker or\ndepositary institution effectuating the\ntransfer of the Cash Component. This deadline\nis likely to be significantly earlier than the\nCutoff Time of the Fund. Investors should be\naware that an Authorized Participant may\nrequire orders for purchases of shares placed\nwith it to be in the particular form required\nby the individual Authorized Participant. The\nAuthorized Participant is responsible for any\nand all expenses and costs incurred by the\nFund, including any applicable cash amounts,\nin connection with any purchase order. Timing\nof Submission of Purchase Orders. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable order to purchase shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Fund to the Distributor or its\nagent pursuant to procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Economic or\nmarket disruptions or changes, or telephone or\nother communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. Orders to create\nshares of the Fund that are submitted on the\nBusiness Day immediately preceding a holiday\nor a day (other than a weekend) when the\nequity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market\nare closed may not be accepted. The Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as the Fund's \u201c\nCutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\n\n71\n\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with the\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Fund are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFund will accept the order, subject to the\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once the Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. The Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, the Fund may reject or revoke a\ncreation order transmitted to it by the\nDistributor or its agent if (i) the order is\nnot in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding shares of\nthe Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not conform to the identity and\nnumber of shares specified, as described\nabove; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit\nSecurities is not legally required or would,\nin the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or (v)\ncircumstances outside the control of the Fund,\nthe Distributor or its agent and BFA make it\nimpracticable to process purchase orders. The\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a\nprospective purchaser of a Creation Unit\nand/or the Authorized Participant acting on\nbehalf of such purchaser of its rejection of\nsuch order. The Fund, State Street, the sub-\ncustodian and the Distributor or its agent are\nunder no duty, however, to give notification\nof any defects or irregularities in the\ndelivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of\nthem incur any liability for failure to give\nsuch notification. Issuance of a Creation\nUnit. Except as provided herein, a Creation\nUnit will not be issued until the transfer of\ngood title to the Fund of the Deposit\nSecurities and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the sub-\ncustodian has confirmed to the custodian that\nthe securities included in the Fund Deposit\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant sub-\ncustodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor\nor its agent and BFA shall be notified of such\ndelivery and the Fund will issue and cause the\ndelivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units\nare generally issued on a \u201c T+2 basis \u201d ( i.e.\n, two Business Days after trade date).\nHowever, the Fund reserves the right to settle\nCreation Unit transactions on a basis other\nthan T+2, including a shorter settlement\nperiod, if necessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. For example, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle Creation Unit transactions on a\nbasis other than T+2 in order to accommodate\nnon-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account\nfor different treatment among non-U.S. and\nU.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-\ndividend dates ( i.e. , the last day the\nholder of a security can sell the security and\nstill receive dividends payable on the\nsecurity) and in certain other circumstances.\nTo the extent contemplated by an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement with the Distributor,\nthe Fund will issue Creation Units to such\nAuthorized Participant, notwithstanding the\nfact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have\nnot been received in part or in whole, in\nreliance on the undertaking of the Authorized\nParticipant to deliver the missing Deposit\nSecurities as soon as possible, which\nundertaking shall be secured by such\nAuthorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\nbuy Deposit Securities for the Fund. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe contractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Fund's current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Fund to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Fund of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges. In certain cases,\nAuthorized Participants may create and redeem\nCreation Units on the same trade date and in\nthese instances, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to\n\n72\n\nthe number of shares of each security in the\nDeposit Securities and the validity, form,\neligibility and acceptance for deposit of any\nsecurities to be delivered shall be determined\nby the Fund and the Fund's determination shall\nbe final and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer, processing and other transaction\ncosts associated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. The standard creation transaction fee\nis charged on each Creation Unit created by an\nAuthorized Participant on the day of the\ntransaction. The standard creation transaction\nfee is generally fixed at the amount shown in\nthe table below regardless of the number of\nCreation Units being purchased, but may be\nreduced by the Fund if transfer and processing\nexpenses associated with the creation are\nanticipated to be lower than the stated fee.\nIf a purchase consists of a cash portion, the\nAuthorized Participant may also be required to\npay an additional transaction charge (up to\nthe maximum amount shown below) to cover\nbrokerage and certain other costs related to\nthe creation transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs). Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Deposit Securities to the\nFund. Certain fees/costs associated with\ncreation transactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\nacquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for\nsuch services. The following table sets forth\nthe Fund's standard creation transaction fees\nand maximum additional charge (as described\nabove):\n                                              \n  Standard                 Maximum            \n  CreationTransaction Fee  AdditionalCharge*  \n  $13,400                  7.0%               \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit. If a purchase consists of a\ncash portion and the Fund places a brokerage\ntransaction to purchase portfolio securities\nwith the Authorized Participant (or an\naffiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), the\nAuthorized Participant may be required, in its\ncapacity as broker-dealer with respect to that\ntransaction, to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution, and price\nmovement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nRedemption of Creation Units. Shares of the\nFund may be redeemed by Authorized\nParticipants only in Creation Units at their\nNAV next determined after receipt of a\nredemption request in proper form by the\nDistributor or its agent and only on a\nBusiness Day. The Fund will not redeem shares\nin amounts less than Creation Units. There can\nbe no assurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the secondary market\nat any time to permit assembly of a Creation\nUnit. Investors should expect to incur\nbrokerage and other costs in connection with\nassembling a sufficient number of shares to\nconstitute a Creation Unit that could be\nredeemed by an Authorized Participant.\nBeneficial owners also may sell shares in the\nsecondary market. The Fund generally redeems\nCreation Units partially for cash. However,\nthe Fund reserves the right to distribute\nsecurities and other portfolio instruments in-\nkind as payment for Creation Units being\nredeemed. Please see the Cash Redemption\nMethod section below and the following\ndiscussion summarizing the in-kind method for\nfurther information on redeeming Creation\nUnits of the Fund. The Fund publishes the\ndesignated portfolio of securities (including\nany portion of such securities for which cash\nmay be substituted) that will be applicable to\nredemption requests received in proper form\n(as defined below) on that day ( \u201c Fund\nSecurities \u201d or \u201c Redemption Basket \u201d ), and\nan amount of cash (the \u201c Cash Amount, \u201d as\ndescribed below) in order to effect\nredemptions of Creation Units of the Fund.\nSuch Fund Securities and Cash Amount will\nremain in effect until such time as the next\nannounced composition of the Fund Securities\nand Cash Amount is made available. The Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount are subject to\npossible amendment or correction. Fund\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. If redemptions are\nnot paid in cash, the redemption proceeds for\na Creation Unit generally consist of Fund\nSecurities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an\namount equal to the difference between the NAV\nof the shares being redeemed, as next\n\n73\n\ndetermined after the receipt of a redemption\nrequest in proper form, and the value of Fund\nSecurities, less a redemption transaction fee\n(as described below). The Trust may, in its\nsole discretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. The Fund generally\nredeems Creation Units partially for cash. The\nFund may, in its sole discretion, provide such\nredeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio\nof securities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Fund Securities, but does\nnot differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may\nalso be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index rebalance to reflect revisions\nthat account for index additions, deletions,\nand re-weights. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\nfull cash redemptions of Creation Units of its\nfunds, when partial or full cash redemptions\nof Creation Units are available or specified\n(Creation Units of the Fund are generally\nredeemed partially for cash or where the\nmarket for individual securities does not\npermit in-kind redemption), they will be\neffected in essentially the same manner as in-\nkind redemptions thereof. In the case of\npartial or full cash redemption, the\nAuthorized Participant receives the cash\nequivalent of the Fund Securities and other\ninstruments it would otherwise receive through\nan in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash\nAmount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer. The\nAuthorized Participant will also be required\nto pay certain transaction fees and charges\nfor cash redemptions, as described below, and,\nif transacting as broker with the Fund, may be\nrequired to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution and price movement\ncosts through an Execution Performance\nGuarantee, as described in the Brokerage\nTransactions section of this SAI. Cash\nredemption proceeds will be paid to the\nAuthorized Participant redeeming shares as\nsoon as practicable after the date of\nredemption or within seven calendar days\nthereafter. If a Fund settles redemptions on a\ncash basis and an Authorized Participant has\nentered into an Execution Performance\nGuarantee, but the Authorized Participant is\nunable, as determined by BFA in its sole\ndiscretion, to execute the market transactions\nthat are the subject of the Execution\nPerformance Guarantee due to an extended\nmarket holiday that goes over seven calendar\ndays or in certain other situations where all\nor a portion of the transactions are unable to\nbe executed within seven calendar days, then\nthe Fund may pay the full amount of the\nredemption order (or the remaining amount of\nthe redemption order based on the unexecuted\nportion of the transaction) within the\noriginal seven calendar day period by using\nthe Fund\u2019s overdraft facility, line of credit\nor cash on hand. The Authorized Participant\n(or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-\ndealer), acting on an agency basis, will\nsubsequently enter into one or more separate\nmarket transactions when the markets reopen or\nthe trades are otherwise able to be executed\nthrough which a Fund sells the Fund Securities\n(or the remaining unsold Fund Securities)\nsubject to a guaranteed sales price. If the\nAuthorized Participant (or an affiliated or\nunaffiliated broker-dealer) achieves\nexecutions in market transactions at a price\nmore favorable than a Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nFund Securities as of the NAV calculation\napplicable on the date of the redemption, then\nthe Authorized Participant generally may\nretain the excess transaction proceeds.\nSpecifically, if the Authorized Participant is\nunable to achieve executions in market\ntransactions at a price at least equal to the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the Fund Securities as of\nthe NAV calculation applicable on the date of\nthe redemption, then the Authorized\nParticipant is generally required to make the\napplicable shortfall payment to the Fund. In\naddition, if transacting as broker with a Fund\nin a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the Authorized\nParticipant may be required to cover foreign\nexchange costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI. If\nthe foreign exchange transaction associated\nwith the applicable security trades can only\noccur upon the settlement of a security trade\nand such trades are unable, as determined by\nBFA in its sole discretion, to be settled by\nthe seventh calendar day after receipt of the\nAuthorized Participant\u2019s redemption order,\nthen a Fund may pay within the original seven\ncalendar day period the amount due in respect\nof the redemption order based on the foreign\nexchange rate as of the\n\n74\n\ndate of the redemption order by using the\nFund\u2019s overdraft facility, line of credit or\ncash on hand (in addition to any sales\nproceeds from the executed portion of the\noriginal brokerage order) and subsequently\nenter into one or more separate foreign\nexchange transactions with the Authorized\nParticipant (or a broker-dealer affiliate of\nthe Authorized Participant or a third-party\nbroker-dealer engaged through the Authorized\nParticipant), acting on an agency basis, and\nbe subject to a guaranteed sales price. If the\nAuthorized Participant achieves execution of\nthe foreign exchange transactions at a price\nmore favorable than the foreign exchange rate\nas of the NAV calculation applicable on the\ndate of the redemption, then the Authorized\nParticipant generally may retain the excess\ntransaction proceeds. If the Authorized\nParticipant is unable to achieve execution of\nthe foreign exchange transactions at a price\nat least equal to the foreign exchange rate as\nof the NAV calculation applicable on the date\nof the redemption, then the Authorized\nParticipant is required to make the applicable\nshortfall payment to the Fund. Costs\nAssociated with Redemption Transactions. A\nstandard redemption transaction fee is imposed\nto offset transfer, processing and other\ntransaction costs that may be incurred by the\nFund. The standard redemption transaction fee\nis charged on each Creation Unit redeemed by\nan Authorized Participant on the day of the\ntransaction. The standard redemption\ntransaction fee is generally fixed at the\namount shown in the table below regardless of\nthe number of Creation Units being redeemed,\nbut may be reduced by the Fund if transfer and\nprocessing expenses associated with the\nredemption are anticipated to be lower than\nthe stated fee. If a redemption consists of a\ncash portion, the Authorized Participant may\nalso be required to pay an additional\ntransaction charge (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) to cover brokerage and certain\nother costs related to the redemption\ntransaction (which may, in certain instances,\nbe based on a good faith estimate of\ntransaction costs). Authorized Participants\nwill also bear the costs of transferring the\nFund Securities from the Fund to their account\non their order. Certain fees/costs associated\nwith redemption transactions may be waived in\ncertain circumstances. Investors who use the\nservices of a broker or other financial\nintermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be\ncharged a fee for such services. The following\ntable sets forth the Fund's standard\nredemption transaction fees and maximum\nadditional charge (as described above):\n                                              \n  Standard                 Maximum            \n  RedemptionTransaction    AdditionalCharge*  \n  Fee                                         \n  $13,400                  2.0%               \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\nredemption transaction fee. If a redemption\nconsists of a cash portion and the Fund places\na brokerage transaction to sell portfolio\nsecurities with the Authorized Participant (or\nan affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer),\nthe Authorized Participant may be required, in\nits capacity as broker-dealer with respect to\nthat transaction, to cover certain brokerage,\ntax, foreign exchange, execution, and price\nmovement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nPlacement of Redemption Orders. Redemption\nrequests for Creation Units of the Fund must\nbe submitted to the Distributor or its agent\nby or through an Authorized Participant. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable request to redeem shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, the Fund may\nrequire orders to redeem Creation Units to be\nplaced earlier that day. Investors, other than\nAuthorized Participants, are responsible for\nmaking arrangements for a redemption request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. The Authorized Participant must\ntransmit the request for redemption in the\nform required by the Fund to the Distributor\nor its agent in accordance with procedures set\nforth in the Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that,\ntherefore, requests to redeem Creation Units\nmay have to be placed by the investor's broker\nthrough an Authorized Participant who has\nexecuted an Authorized Participant Agreement.\nAt any time, only a limited number of broker-\ndealers will have an Authorized Participant\nAgreement in effect. Investors making a\nredemption request should be aware that such\nrequest must be in the form specified by such\nAuthorized Participant. Investors making a\nrequest to redeem Creation Units should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe request by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Fund's transfer\nagent; such\n\n75\n\ninvestors should allow for the additional time\nthat may be required to effect redemptions\nthrough their banks, brokers or other\nfinancial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Fund's\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the Fund is\nreceived by the Distributor or its agent from\nthe Authorized Participant on behalf of itself\nor another redeeming investor within the time\nperiods specified above; and (iii) all other\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement are properly followed.\nUpon receiving a redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent shall notify the Fund\nand the Fund's transfer agent of such\nredemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds by the Fund are generally made within\ntwo Business Days ( i.e ., \u201c T+2 \u201d ). However,\nthe Fund reserves the right to settle\nredemption transactions on a basis other than\nT+2, including a shorter settlement period, if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. For example, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle redemption transactions on a basis\nother than T+2 in order to accommodate\nnon-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account\nfor different treatment among non-U.S. and\nU.S. markets of dividend record dates and\ndividend ex-dates ( i.e. , the last date the\nholder of a security can sell the security and\nstill receive dividends payable on the\nsecurity sold) and in certain other\ncircumstances consistent with applicable law.\nIf neither the Authorized Participant nor the\nBeneficial Owner on whose behalf the\nAuthorized Participant is acting has\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nFund Securities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, the Fund may\nin its discretion exercise its option to\nredeem such shares in cash, and the Beneficial\nOwner will be required to receive its\nredemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the\ninvestor will receive a cash payment equal to\nthe net asset value of its shares based on the\nNAV of the Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charges specified above to offset\nthe Fund's brokerage and other transaction\ncosts associated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and the Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right\nto redeem Creation Units for cash to the\nextent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver\nspecific Fund Securities upon redemptions or\ncannot do so without first registering the\nFund Securities under such laws. Although the\nTrust does not ordinarily permit cash\nredemptions of Creation Units (except that, as\nnoted above, Creation Units of the Fund\ngenerally will be redeemed partially for\ncash), in the event that cash redemptions are\npermitted or required by the Trust, proceeds\nwill be paid to the Authorized Participant\nredeeming shares as soon as practicable after\nthe date of redemption (within seven calendar\ndays thereafter). If the Fund includes a\nforeign investment in its basket, and if a\nlocal market holiday, or series of consecutive\nholidays, or the extended delivery cycles for\ntransferring foreign investments to redeeming\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of the foreign investment in response\nto a redemption request, the Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if the Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant's\nagreement with the Distributor or its agent,\nin the event an Authorized Participant has\nsubmitted a redemption request in proper form\nbut is unable to transfer all or part of the\nCreation Unit to be redeemed to the Fund, at\nor prior to the time specified by the Fund or\nits custodian on the Business Day after the\ndate of submission of such redemption request,\nthe Distributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business\n\n76\n\nDay after the date of submission of such\nredemption request and shall be held by State\nStreet and marked-to-market daily. The fees of\nState Street and any sub-custodians in respect\nof the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of\nthe collateral shall be payable by the\nAuthorized Participant. The Authorized\nParticipant Agreement permits the Fund to\nacquire shares of the Fund at any time and\nsubjects the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the\naggregate of the cost to the Fund of\npurchasing such shares, plus the value of the\nCash Amount, and the value of the collateral\ntogether with liability for related brokerage\nand other charges. Because the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund may trade on\nexchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange\nis closed or are otherwise not Business Days\nfor the Fund, shareholders may not be able to\nredeem their shares of the Fund or purchase or\nsell shares of the Fund on the Listing\nExchange on days when the NAV of the Fund\ncould be significantly affected by events in\nthe relevant non-U.S. markets. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of\npayment postponed with respect to the Fund:\n(i) for any period during which the Listing\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Listing\nExchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for\nany period during which an emergency exists as\na result of which disposal of the shares of\nthe Fund's portfolio securities or\ndetermination of its NAV is not reasonably\npracticable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Fund may accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\nthe Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. The Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of the Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of the Fund may be taken\ninto account. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for the Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Fund, as set forth in the\nFund's policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets.\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of the\nFund. This summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to the Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in the\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Regulated Investment\nCompany Qualifications. The Fund intends to\nqualify for treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet\n\n77\n\nseveral other requirements. Among such other\nrequirements are the following: (i) at least\n90% of the Fund\u2019s annual gross income must be\nderived from dividends, interest, payments\nwith respect to securities loans, gains from\nthe sale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of the\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of the Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of the\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. The Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, the Fund fails one of these\ntests and does not timely cure the failure,\nthe Fund will be taxed in the same manner as\nan ordinary corporation and distributions to\nits shareholders will not be deductible by the\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. The\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, the Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, the Fund\nmust distribute to its shareholders at least\nthe sum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than its\nnet realized long-term capital gain over its\nnet realized short-term capital loss), plus or\nminus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its\nnet tax-exempt income for the taxable year.\nThe Fund will be subject to income tax at\nregular corporate rates on any taxable income\nor gains that it does not distribute to its\nshareholders. If the Fund fails to qualify for\nany taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the\ndistribution requirement, all of its taxable\nincome will be subject to tax at regular\ncorporate income tax rates without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand such distributions generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends\nto the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although the\nFund intends to distribute substantially all\nof its net investment income and its capital\ngains for each taxable year, the Fund may\ndecide to retain a portion of its income or\ngains if the Fund determines that doing so is\nin the interest of its shareholders. The Fund\nwill be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. If the Fund fails\nto qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay\nout its earnings and profits accumulated in\nthat year in order to qualify again as a RIC.\nIf the Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a\nperiod greater than two taxable years, the\nFund may be required to recognize any net\nbuilt-in gains with respect to certain of its\nassets ( i.e., the excess of the aggregate\ngains, including items of income, over\naggregate losses that would have been realized\nwith respect to such assets if the Fund had\nbeen liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Excise Tax. The Fund will be\nsubject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by the Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. The Fund intends to declare and\ndistribute dividends and distributions in the\namounts and at the times necessary to avoid\nthe application of this 4% excise tax.\n\n78\n\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards. Net capital\nloss carryforwards may be applied against any\nnet realized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that the Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of the Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. Taxation of U.S.\nShareholders. Dividends and other\ndistributions by the Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by the Fund\nin October, November or December of any\ncalendar year and payable to shareholders of\nrecord on a specified date in such a month\nshall be deemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if the Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\nthe Fund reports as capital gains dividends\nare taxable as long-term capital gains,\nwhether paid in cash or in shares and\nregardless of how long a shareholder has held\nshares of the Fund. All other dividends of the\nFund (including dividends from short-term\ncapital gains) from its current and\naccumulated earnings and profits ( \u201c regular\ndividends \u201d ) are generally subject to tax as\nordinary income, subject to the discussion of\nqualified dividend income below. Long-term\ncapital gains are eligible for taxation at a\nmaximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate\nshareholders, depending on whether their\nincome exceeds certain threshold amounts. If\nan individual receives a regular dividend\nqualifying for the long-term capital gains\nrates and such dividend constitutes an \u201c\nextraordinary dividend, \u201d and the individual\nsubsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or\nexchange of stock in respect of which the\nextraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss\nwill be long-term capital loss to the extent\nof such extraordinary dividend. An \u201c\nextraordinary dividend \u201d on common stock for\nthis purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an\namount greater than or equal to 10% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within an 85-day period, or\n(ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within a 365-day period.\nDistributions in excess of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits will, as\nto each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free\nreturn of capital to the extent of a\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund, and\nas a capital gain thereafter (if the\nshareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets). Distributions in excess of\nthe Fund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements,\nbut not in excess of the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. Shareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on net investment\nincome, including, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates and trusts.\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution\n\n79\n\nmay nevertheless be taxable to them. If the\nFund is the holder of record of any security\non the record date for any dividends payable\nwith respect to such security, such dividends\nwill be included in the Fund\u2019s gross income\nnot as of the date received but as of the\nlater of (a) the date such security became ex-\ndividend with respect to such dividends ( i.e.\n, the date on which a buyer of the security\nwould not be entitled to receive the declared,\nbut unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the\nFund acquired such security. Accordingly, in\norder to satisfy its income distribution\nrequirements, the Fund may be required to pay\ndividends based on anticipated earnings, and\nshareholders may receive dividends in an\nearlier year than would otherwise be the case.\nIn certain situations, the Fund may, for a\ntaxable year, defer all or a portion of its\nnet capital loss (or if there is no net\ncapital loss, then any net long-term or short-\nterm capital loss) realized after October and\nits late-year ordinary loss (defined as the\nsum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign\ncurrency and passive foreign investment\ncompany ( \u201c PFIC \u201d ) losses over post-October\nforeign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the\nexcess of post-December ordinary losses over\npost-December ordinary income) until the next\ntaxable year in computing its investment\ncompany taxable income and net capital gain,\nwhich will defer the recognition of such\nrealized losses. Such deferrals and other\nrules regarding gains and losses realized\nafter October (or December) may affect the tax\ncharacter of shareholder distributions. Sales\nof Shares. Upon the sale or exchange of shares\nof the Fund, a shareholder will realize a\ntaxable gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized and the\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund. A\nredemption of shares by the Fund will be\ntreated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain\nor loss will be treated as capital gain or\nloss if the shares are capital assets in the\nshareholder\u2019s hands and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor more than one year and short-term capital\ngain or loss if the shares are held for one\nyear or less. Any loss realized on a sale or\nexchange will be disallowed to the extent the\nshares disposed of are replaced, including\nreplacement through the reinvesting of\ndividends or capital gains distributions, or\nby an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of the Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, the Fund will be required to withhold\nat a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury\nsuch amounts withheld from any distributions\npaid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to the\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability. Sections 351 and 362. The Trust, on\nbehalf of the Fund, has the right to reject an\norder for a purchase of shares of the Fund if\nthe purchaser (or group of purchasers) would,\nupon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80%\nor more of the outstanding shares of the Fund\nand if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, the Fund would have\na basis in the securities different from the\nmarket value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. If the Fund\u2019s basis in such\nsecurities on the date of deposit was less\nthan market value on such date, the Fund, upon\ndisposition of the securities, would recognize\nmore taxable gain or less taxable loss than if\nits basis in the securities had been equal to\nmarket value. It is not anticipated that the\nTrust will exercise the right of rejection\nexcept in a case where the Trust determines\nthat accepting the order could result in\nmaterial adverse tax consequences to the Fund\nor its shareholders. The Trust also has the\nright to require information necessary to\ndetermine beneficial share ownership for\npurposes of the 80% determination.\n\n80\n\nTaxation of Certain Derivatives. The Fund\u2019s\ntransactions in zero coupon securities,\nnon-U.S. currencies, forward contracts,\noptions and futures contracts (including\noptions and futures contracts on non-U.S.\ncurrencies), to the extent permitted, will be\nsubject to special provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code (including provisions relating to\n\u201c hedging transactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d )\nthat, among other consequences, may affect the\ncharacter of gains and losses realized by the\nFund ( i.e. , may affect whether gains or\nlosses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer\nFund losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also (a) will require the Fund to\nmark-to-market certain types of the positions\nin its portfolio ( i.e. , treat them as if\nthey were closed out at the end of each year)\nand (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income\nwithout receiving cash with which to pay\ndividends or make distributions in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\ntaxes. The Fund will monitor its transactions,\nwill make the appropriate tax elections and\nwill make the appropriate entries in its books\nand records when it acquires any zero coupon\nsecurity, non-U.S. currency, forward contract,\noption, futures contract or hedged investment\nin order to mitigate the effect of these rules\nand prevent disqualification of the Fund as a\nRIC. The Fund\u2019s investments in so-called \u201c\nSection 1256 contracts, \u201d such as regulated\nfutures contracts, most non-U.S. currency\nforward contracts traded in the interbank\nmarket and options on most security indexes,\nare subject to special tax rules. All Section\n1256 contracts held by the Fund at the end of\nits taxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by the Fund from positions in Section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by the Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, the Fund may\nmake or receive periodic net payments. The\nFund may also make or receive a payment when a\nswap is terminated prior to maturity through\nan assignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Fund has been a party to the swap\nfor more than one year). With respect to\ncertain types of swaps, the Fund may be\nrequired to currently recognize income or loss\nwith respect to future payments on such swaps\nor may elect under certain circumstances to\nmark such swaps to market annually for tax\npurposes as ordinary income or loss. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by the Fund of\ninvestment company taxable income (including\nany short-term capital gains), whether\nreceived in cash or shares, will be taxable\neither as ordinary income or as qualified\ndividend income, which is eligible to be taxed\nat long-term capital gain rates to the extent\nthe Fund receives qualified dividend income on\nthe securities it holds and the Fund reports\nthe distribution as qualified dividend income.\nQualified dividend income is, in general,\ndividend income from taxable U.S. corporations\n(but generally not from U.S. REITs) and\ncertain non-U.S. corporations ( e.g. ,\nnon-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and\nwhich are incorporated in a possession of the\nU.S. or in certain countries with a\ncomprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the\nstock of which is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the U.S.\n(where the dividends are paid with respect to\nsuch stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the\nU.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax\ntreaties with the following countries:\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados,\nBelgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China (but not with\nHong Kong, which is treated as a separate\njurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus,\nthe Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia,\nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\nRomania, Russia, the Slovak Republic,\nSlovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,\nSri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand,\nTrinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine,\nthe U.K. and Venezuela. Substitute payments\nreceived by the Fund for securities lent out\nby the Fund will not be qualified dividend\nincome. A dividend from the Fund will not be\ntreated as qualified dividend income to the\nextent that: (i) the shareholder has not held\nthe shares on which the dividend was paid for\n61 days during the 121-day period that begins\non the date that is 60 days before the date on\nwhich the shares become ex-dividend with\nrespect to such dividend or the Fund fails to\nsatisfy those holding period requirements with\nrespect to the securities it holds that paid\nthe dividends distributed to the shareholder\n(or, in the case of certain preferred stocks,\nthe holding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) the Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by\nthe Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be\n\n81\n\ntreated as qualified dividend income only to\nthe extent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by the Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by the Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by the Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify\nfor the U.S. federal dividends received\ndeduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum\nholding period during the 90-day period that\nbegins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or\n91-day minimum holding period during the 180\nperiod beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend\ndate for certain preference dividends) during\nwhich risk of loss may not be diminished is\nrequired for the applicable shares, at both\nthe Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend\nto be eligible for the dividends received\ndeduction. Restrictions may apply if\nindebtedness, including a short sale, is\nattributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Fund\nserves to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by its\ntax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in\nthe Fund if shares in the Fund constitute\ndebt-financed property in the hands of the\ntax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by the Fund\nfrom REITs, real estate mortgage investment\nconduits, taxable mortgage pools or other\ninvestments may cause the Fund to report some\nor all of its distributions as \u201c excess\ninclusion income. \u201d To Fund shareholders, such\nexcess inclusion income may: (i) constitute\ntaxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders\nwho would otherwise be tax-exempt such as\nindividual retirement accounts, 401(k)\naccounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and\ncertain charitable entities; (ii) not be\noffset by otherwise allowable deductions for\ntax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for\nreduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S.\nshareholders even from tax treaty countries;\nand (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax\nif certain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust. The Fund tries to avoid\ninvesting in REITs that are expected to\ngenerate excess inclusion income, but the Fund\nmay not always be successful in doing so.\nBecause information about a REIT\u2019s investments\nmay be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a\nREIT may change its investment program, the\nFund may not be successful in avoiding the\nconsequences described above. Avoidance of\ninvestments in REITs that generate excess\ninclusion income may require the Fund to\nforego otherwise attractive investment\nopportunities. Non-U.S. Investments. Under\nSection 988 of the Internal Revenue Code,\ngains or losses attributable to fluctuations\nin exchange rates between the time the Fund\naccrues income or receivables or expenses or\nother liabilities denominated in a non-U.S.\ncurrency and the time the Fund actually\ncollects such income or pays such liabilities\nare generally treated as ordinary income or\nordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses)\nrealized on debt instruments will be treated\nas Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent\nattributable to changes in exchange rates\nbetween the U.S. dollar and the currencies in\nwhich the instruments are denominated.\nSimilarly, gains or losses on non-U.S.\ncurrency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts\nand certain non-U.S. currency options or\nfutures contracts denominated in non-U.S.\ncurrency, to the extent attributable to\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the\nacquisition and disposition dates, are also\ntreated as ordinary income or loss unless the\nFund were to elect otherwise. The Fund may be\nsubject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at\nthe source. The Fund, if permitted to do so,\nmay elect to \u201c pass through \u201d to its investors\nthe amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by\nthe Fund provided that the Fund held the\nsecurity on the dividend settlement date and\nfor at least 15 additional days immediately\nbefore and/or thereafter, with the result that\neach investor with respect to shares of the\nFund held for a minimum 16-day holding period\nat the time of deemed distribution will (i)\ninclude in gross income, even though not\nactually received, the investor\u2019s pro rata\nshare of the Fund\u2019s non-U.S. income taxes, and\n(ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S.\ntaxable income, but only for investors who\nitemize their deductions on their personal tax\nreturns) or credit (in calculating U.S.\nfederal income tax) the investor\u2019s pro rata\nshare of the Fund\u2019s non-U.S. income taxes.\nWithholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S.\nsecurities while such securities are lent out\nby the Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax\ncredit pass through. Taxes not \u201c passed\nthrough \u201d for tax purposes will not be\navailable to\n\n82\n\nshareholders for foreign tax credit purposes.\nA non-U.S. person invested in the Fund in a\nyear that the Fund elects to \u201c pass through \u201d\nits non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving\nadditional dividend income subject to U.S.\nwithholding tax. A non-U.S. tax credit may not\nexceed the investor\u2019s U.S. federal income tax\notherwise payable with respect to the\ninvestor\u2019s non-U.S. source income. For this\npurpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S.\nsource gross income (i) their proportionate\nshares of non-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and\n(ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the\nFund that represents income derived from\nnon-U.S. sources; the Fund\u2019s gain from the\nsale of securities will generally be treated\nas U.S.-source income. Certain limitations\nwill be imposed to the extent to which the\nnon-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your\nFund shares are loaned pursuant to securities\nlending arrangements, you may lose the ability\nto use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through\nby the Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid\nwhile the shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\nwith respect to shares of the Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. Passive Foreign Investment Companies.\nIf the Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax on a\nportion of any \u201c excess distribution \u201d or gain\nfrom the disposition of such shares even if\nsuch income is distributed as a taxable\ndividend by the Fund to its shareholders.\nAdditional charges in the nature of interest\nmay be imposed on the Fund in respect of\ndeferred taxes arising from such distributions\nor gains. If the Fund were to invest in a PFIC\nand elect to treat the PFIC as a \u201c qualified\nelecting fund \u201d under the Internal Revenue\nCode, in lieu of the foregoing requirements,\nthe Fund might be required to include in\nincome each year a portion of the ordinary\nearnings and net capital gains of the\nqualified electing fund, even if not\ndistributed to the Fund, and such amounts\nwould be subject to the 90% and excise tax\ndistribution requirements described above. In\norder to make this election, the Fund would be\nrequired to obtain certain annual information\nfrom the PFICs in which it invests, which may\nbe difficult or impossible to obtain.\nAlternatively, the Fund may make a mark-to-\nmarket election that would result in the Fund\nbeing treated as if it had sold and\nrepurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each\nyear. In such case, the Fund would report any\nsuch gains as ordinary income and would deduct\nany such losses as ordinary losses to the\nextent of previously recognized gains. The\nelection must be made separately for each PFIC\nowned by the Fund and, once made, would be\neffective for all subsequent taxable years,\nunless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By\nmaking the election, the Fund could\npotentially ameliorate the adverse tax\nconsequences with respect to its ownership of\nshares in a PFIC, but in any particular year\nmay be required to recognize income in excess\nof the distributions it receives from PFICs\nand its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC\nstock. The Fund may have to distribute this \u201c\nphantom \u201d income and gain to satisfy the 90%\ndistribution requirement and to avoid\nimposition of the 4% excise tax. The Fund will\nmake the appropriate tax elections, if\npossible, and take any additional steps that\nare necessary to mitigate the effects of these\nrules. Reporting. If a shareholder recognizes\na loss with respect to the Fund\u2019s shares of $2\nmillion or more for an individual shareholder\nor $10 million or more for a corporate\nshareholder, the shareholder must file with\nthe IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form\n8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio\nsecurities are in many cases exempted from\nthis reporting requirement, but under current\nguidance, shareholders of a RIC are not\nexempted. The fact that a loss is reportable\nunder these regulations does not affect the\nlegal determination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by the Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by the Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally not subject to such\nwithholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced\nrate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN\nor IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its\nentitlement to benefits under a treaty. The\nwithholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor\n\n83\n\nbusiness within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Properly-reported\ndividends are generally exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax where they (i) are\npaid in respect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net\ninterest income \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S.\nsource interest income, other than certain\ncontingent interest and interest from\nobligations of a corporation or partnership in\nwhich the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder\nor partner, reduced by expenses that are\nallocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term\ncapital gains \u201d (generally, the excess of the\nFund\u2019s net short-term capital gain over the\nFund\u2019s long-term capital loss for such taxable\nyear). However, depending on its\ncircumstances, the Fund may report all, some\nor none of its potentially eligible dividends\nas such qualified net interest income or as\nqualified short-term capital gains and/or\ntreat such dividends, in whole or in part, as\nineligible for this exemption from\nwithholding. In order to qualify for this\nexemption from withholding, a non-U.S.\nshareholder will need to comply with\napplicable certification requirements relating\nto its non-U.S. status (including, in general,\nfurnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of\nshares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if the Fund\nreports the payment as qualified net interest\nincome or qualified short-term capital gain.\nNon-U.S. shareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts. Special\nrules may apply to a foreign shareholder\nreceiving a Fund distribution if at least 50%\nof the Fund\u2019s assets consist of interests in\nU.S. real property interests, including\ncertain REITs and U.S. real property holding\ncorporations (as defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund\ndistributions that are attributable to gain\nfrom the disposition of a U.S. real property\ninterest will be taxable as ordinary dividends\nand subject to withholding at a 30% or lower\ntreaty rate if the foreign shareholder held no\nmore than 5% of the Fund\u2019s shares at any time\nduring the one-year period ending on the date\nof the distribution. If the foreign\nshareholder held at least 5% of the Fund\u2019s\nshares, the distribution would be treated as\nincome effectively connected with a trade or\nbusiness within the U.S. and the foreign\nshareholder would be subject to withholding\ntax at a rate of 21% and would generally be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences would generally\napply to a foreign shareholder\u2019s gain on the\nsale of Fund shares unless the Fund is\ndomestically controlled (meaning that more\nthan 50% of the value of the Fund\u2019s shares is\nheld by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign\nshareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund\u2019s\nshares at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of sale. Finally, a\ndomestically controlled Fund may be required\nto recognize a portion of its gain on the in-\nkind distribution of certain U.S. real\nproperty interests. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund. The rules\nlaid out in the previous two paragraphs, other\nthan the withholding rules, will apply\nnotwithstanding the Fund\u2019s participation in a\nwash sale transaction or its payment of a\nsubstitute dividend.

Separately,\na 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to: (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply.\n\n84\n\nShares of the Fund held by a non-U.S.\nshareholder at death will be considered\nsituated within the U.S. and subject to the\nU.S. estate tax.

We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017.

Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties.

Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals. We also publish a quarterly list of\nall companies with which we engaged and the\nkey topics addressed in the engagement\nmeeting. In this way, we help inform our\nclients about the work we do on their behalf\nin promoting the governance and business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\n11 The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.\n\nA-15\n\nIS-SAI-EQLT-0824\n\niShares \u00ae Trust Statement of Additional\nInformation Dated December 4, 2023\n(as revised August 30, 2024) This Statement of\nAdditional Information ( \u201c SAI \u201d ) is not a\nprospectus.

330\ninvestment series or portfolios. The Trust was\norganized as a Delaware statutory trust on\nDecember 16, 1999 and is authorized to have\nmultiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 Act.\nThe offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ). This SAI\nrelates solely to the Fund. The Fund is\nmanaged by BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d\n), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of\nBlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track\nthe investment results of the specific\nbenchmark index identified in the Fund's\nProspectus (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ). The\nFund offers and issues shares at their net\nasset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares\n(each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ), generally in\nexchange for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other positions\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) included in its\nUnderlying Index (the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d\nor \u201c Creation Basket \u201d ), together with the\ndeposit of a specified cash payment (the \u201c\nCash Component \u201d ). Shares of the Fund are\nlisted for trading on Cboe BZX (the \u201c Listing\nExchange \u201d ), a national securities exchange.\nShares of the Fund are traded in the secondary\nmarket and elsewhere at market prices that may\nbe at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares\nare redeemable only in Creation Units by\nAuthorized Participants (as defined in the\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role\nof the Authorized Participant section of this\nSAI), and, generally, in exchange for\nportfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as\ndefined in the Redemption of Creation Units\nsection of this SAI). Creation Units typically\nare a specified number of shares, generally\n60,000 or multiples thereof. The Trust\nreserves the right to permit or require that\ncreations and redemptions of shares are\neffected fully or partially in cash and\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of\ncash. Shares may be issued in advance of\nreceipt of Deposit Securities, subject to\nvarious conditions, including a requirement\nthat the Authorized Participant maintain with\nthe Trust collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\npurchase Deposit Securities. See the Creation\nand Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI. Transaction fees and other costs\nassociated with creations or redemptions that\ninclude a cash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin the Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of the Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe Prospectus. Shares of the Fund are listed\nfor trading, and trade throughout the day, on\nthe Listing Exchange and in other secondary\nmarkets. Shares of the Fund may also be listed\non certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no\nassurance that the requirements of the Listing\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nshares of the Fund will continue to be met.\nThe Listing Exchange may, but is not required\nto, remove the shares of the Fund from listing\nif, among other things: (i) following the\ninitial 12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of the Fund; (ii) the Fund is\nno longer eligible to operate in reliance on\nRule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act;\n(iii) any of the other listing requirements\nare not continuously maintained; or (iv) any\nevent shall occur or condition shall exist\nthat, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of the Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission determined by that broker, as well\nas other charges.\n\n1\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nshare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund. Investment\nStrategies and Risks The Fund seeks to achieve\nits objective by investing primarily in\nsecurities issued by issuers that compose the\nUnderlying Index and in investments that\nprovide substantially similar exposure to\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\noperates as an index fund and is not actively\nmanaged. Adverse performance of a security in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio will ordinarily not\nresult in the elimination of the security from\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio. The Fund engages in\nrepresentative sampling, which is investing in\na sample of securities selected by BFA to have\na collective investment profile similar to\nthat of the Fund's Underlying Index.\nSecurities selected have aggregate investment\ncharacteristics (based on market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability, earnings valuation and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to those of the\nFund\u2019s Underlying Index. A fund that uses\nrepresentative sampling generally does not\nhold all of the securities that are in its\nunderlying index. Although the Fund does not\nseek leveraged returns, certain instruments\nused by the Fund may have a leveraging effect\nas described below. Borrowing. The Fund may\nborrow for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The purchase\nof securities while borrowings are outstanding\nmay have the effect of leveraging the Fund.\nThe incurrence of leverage increases the\nFund\u2019s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds\nare subject to interest costs that will reduce\nnet income. Purchasing securities while\nborrowings are outstanding creates special\nrisks, such as the potential for greater\nvolatility in the NAV of Fund shares and in\nthe yield on the Fund\u2019s portfolio. In\naddition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the\namount available (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\nthe Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by the Fund must be made from a\nbank or may result in the Fund being subject\nto covenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire the Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Currency\nTransactions. A currency forward contract is\nan over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) obligation to\npurchase or sell a specific currency at a\nfuture date, which may be any fixed number of\ndays greater than two days from the date on\nwhich the contract is agreed upon by the\nparties, at a price set at the time of the\ncontract. A non-deliverable currency forward\nis an OTC currency forward settled in a\nspecified currency, on a specified date, based\non the difference between the agreed-upon\nexchange rate and the market exchange rate. A\ncurrency futures contract is a contract that\ntrades on an organized futures exchange\ninvolving an obligation to deliver or acquire\na specified amount of a specific currency, at\na specified price and at a specified future\ntime. Currency futures contracts may be\nsettled on a net cash payment basis rather\nthan by the sale and delivery of the\nunderlying currency. The Fund does not expect\nto engage in currency transactions for the\npurpose of hedging against declines in the\nvalue of the Fund's assets that are\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency. The Fund\nmay enter into non-U.S. currency forward and\nnon-U.S. currency futures transactions to\nfacilitate local securities settlements or to\nprotect against currency exposure in\nconnection with its distributions to\nshareholders, but may not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes. Foreign\nexchange transactions involve a significant\ndegree of risk and the markets in which\nforeign exchange transactions are effected may\nbe highly volatile, highly specialized and\nhighly technical. Significant changes,\nincluding changes in liquidity and prices, can\noccur in such markets within very short\nperiods of time, often within minutes. Foreign\nexchange trading risks include, but are not\nlimited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty\nrisk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and\npotential interference\n\n2\n\nby foreign governments through regulation of\nlocal exchange markets, foreign investment or\nparticular transactions in non-U.S. currency.\nIf BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions\nat an inappropriate time or judges market\nconditions, trends or correlations\nincorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may\nnot serve their intended purpose of improving\nthe correlation of the Fund's return with the\nperformance of the Underlying Index and may\nlower the Fund\u2019s return. The Fund could\nexperience losses if the value of its currency\nforwards, options or futures positions were\npoorly correlated with its other investments\nor if it could not close out its positions\nbecause of an illiquid market or otherwise. In\naddition, the Fund could incur transaction\ncosts, including trading commissions, in\nconnection with certain non-U.S. currency\ntransactions. Diversification Status. The Fund\nis classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d A \u201c non-\ndiversified \u201d fund is a fund that is not\nlimited by the 1940 Act with regard to the\npercentage of its assets that may be invested\nin the securities of a single issuer. The\nsecurities of a particular issuer (or\nsecurities of issuers in particular\nindustries) may constitute a significant\npercentage of the underlying index of such a\nfund and, consequently, the fund\u2019s investment\nportfolio. This may adversely affect the\nfund\u2019s performance or subject the fund\u2019s\nshares to greater price volatility than that\nexperienced by more diversified investment\ncompanies. The Fund intends to maintain the\nrequired level of diversification and\notherwise conduct its operations so as to\nqualify as a regulated investment company ( \u201c\nRIC \u201d ) for purposes of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c\nInternal Revenue Code \u201d ), and to relieve the\nFund of any liability for U.S. federal income\ntax to the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to shareholders, provided that the\nFund satisfies a minimum distribution\nrequirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective. Futures, Options on Futures and\nSecurities Options. Futures contracts, options\non futures and securities options may be used\nby the Fund to simulate investment in its\nUnderlying Index, to facilitate trading or to\nreduce transaction costs. The Fund may enter\ninto futures contracts and options on futures\nthat are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures\nexchange. The Fund will not use futures,\noptions on futures or securities options for\nspeculative purposes. The Fund intends to use\nfutures and options on futures in accordance\nwith Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under\nthe Commodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA,\nwith respect to the Fund, has claimed an\nexclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d in accordance with\nRule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to the\nFund, is not subject to registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under\nthe CEA. See the Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives section of this SAI for more\ninformation. Futures contracts provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. The\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, the Fund\nwill be required to deposit with the broker an\namount of cash or cash equivalents known as \u201c\ninitial margin, \u201d which is similar to a\nperformance bond or good faith deposit on the\ncontract and is returned to the Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, the Fund may elect to close the\nposition by taking an opposite position, which\nwill operate to terminate the Fund\u2019s existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof the Fund. The potential for loss related to\nwriting call options is unlimited. The\npotential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. The Fund may purchase and write put and\ncall options on futures contracts\n\n3\n\nthat are traded on an exchange as a hedge\nagainst changes in value of its portfolio\nsecurities or in anticipation of the purchase\nof securities, and may enter into closing\ntransactions with respect to such options to\nterminate existing positions. There is no\nguarantee that such closing transactions can\nbe effected. Securities options may be used by\nthe Fund to obtain access to securities in the\nUnderlying Index or to dispose of securities\nin the Underlying Index at favorable prices,\nto invest cash in a securities index that\noffers similar exposure to that provided by\nthe Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve\nthe Fund\u2019s objective of tracking the\nUnderlying Index. A call option gives a holder\nthe right to purchase a specific security at a\nspecified price ( \u201c exercise price \u201d ) within\na specified period of time. A put option gives\na holder the right to sell a specific security\nat an exercise price within a specified period\nof time. The initial purchaser of a call\noption pays the \u201c writer \u201d a premium, which is\npaid at the time of purchase and is retained\nby the writer whether or not such option is\nexercised. The Fund may purchase put options\nto hedge its portfolio against the risk of a\ndecline in the market value of securities held\nand may purchase call options to hedge against\nan increase in the price of securities it is\ncommitted to purchase. The Fund may write put\nand call options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. The Fund may purchase or sell\nsecurities options on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nsecurities exchange or in the OTC market\nthrough a transaction with a dealer. Options\non a securities index are typically settled on\na net basis based on the appreciation or\ndepreciation of the index level over the\nstrike price. Options on single name\nsecurities may be cash- or physically-settled,\ndepending upon the market in which they are\ntraded. Options may be structured so as to be\nexercisable only on certain dates or on a\ndaily basis. Options may also be structured to\nhave conditions to exercise ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-\nin Events \u201d ) or conditions that trigger\ntermination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out Events \u201d ).\nLending Portfolio Securities. The Fund may\nlend portfolio securities to certain borrowers\nthat BFA determines to be creditworthy,\nincluding borrowers affiliated with BFA. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is\nmaintained in an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent market value of the securities loaned.\nNo securities loan shall be made on behalf of\nthe Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value\nof all securities loans of the Fund exceeds\none-third of the value of the Fund's total\nassets (including the value of the collateral\nreceived). The Fund may terminate a loan at\nany time and obtain the return of the\nsecurities loaned. The Fund receives, by way\nof substitute payment, the value of any\ninterest or cash or non-cash distributions\npaid on the loaned securities that it would\nhave otherwise received if the securities were\nnot on loan. With respect to loans that are\ncollateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount\nof cash collateral. The Fund is compensated by\nany positive difference between the amount\nearned on the reinvestment of cash collateral\nand the fee paid to the borrower. In the case\nof collateral other than cash, the Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of the Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nThe Fund conducts its securities lending\npursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC\npermitting it to lend portfolio securities to\nborrowers affiliated with the Fund and to\nretain an affiliate of the Fund to act as\nsecurities lending agent. To the extent that\nthe Fund engages in securities lending,\nBlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (\n\u201c BTC \u201d ) acts as securities lending agent for\nthe Fund, subject to the overall supervision\nof BFA. BTC administers the lending program in\naccordance with guidelines approved by the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the\ntrustees of which are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ).\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d )\nserves as custodian for the Fund in connection\nwith certain securities lending activities.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk (\ni.e ., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk ( i.e ., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees the Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (\ni.e. , the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If the Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, the Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In\n\n4\n\nthe event a borrower does not return the\nFund\u2019s securities as agreed, the Fund\u2019s\nability to participate in a corporate action\nevent may be impacted, or the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. This latter event\ncould trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. The Fund could lose money if its short-\nterm investment of the collateral declines in\nvalue over the period of the loan. Substitute\npayments received by the Fund representing\ndividends paid on securities loaned out by the\nFund will not be considered qualified dividend\nincome. BTC will take into account the tax\neffects on shareholders caused by this\ndifference in connection with the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to the Fund (as permitted by\napplicable law). Regulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require certain bank-\nregulated counterparties and certain of their\naffiliates to include in certain financial\ncontracts, including many securities lending\nagreements, terms that delay or restrict the\nrights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to\nterminate such agreements, foreclose upon\ncollateral, exercise other default rights or\nrestrict transfers of credit support in the\nevent that the counterparty and/or its\naffiliates are subject to certain types of\nresolution or insolvency proceedings. It is\npossible that these requirements, as well as\npotential additional government regulation and\nother developments in the market, could\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to\nterminate existing securities lending\nagreements or to realize amounts to be\nreceived under such agreements. Liquidity Risk\nManagement. Rule 22e-4 under the Investment\nCompany Act (the \u201c Liquidity Rule \u201d ) requires\nopen-end funds, including exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) such as the Fund, to\nestablish a liquidity risk management program\n(the \u201c Liquidity Program \u201d ) and enhance\ndisclosures regarding fund liquidity. As\nrequired by the Liquidity Rule, the Fund has\nimplemented a Liquidity Program, and the\nBoard, including a majority of the Independent\nTrustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as\nthe administrator of the Liquidity Program.\nUnder the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses,\nmanages, and periodically reviews the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk and classifies each investment\nheld by the Fund as a \u201c highly liquid\ninvestment, \u201d \u201c moderately liquid investment,\n\u201d \u201c less liquid investment \u201d or \u201c illiquid\ninvestment. \u201d The Liquidity Rule defines \u201c\nliquidity risk \u201d as the risk that the Fund\ncould not meet requests to redeem shares\nissued by the Fund without significant\ndilution of the remaining investors\u2019 interest\nin the Fund. The liquidity of the Fund's\nportfolio investments is determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment-\nspecific considerations under the Liquidity\nProgram. There are exclusions from certain\nportions of the liquidity risk management\nprogram requirements for \u201c in-kind \u201d ETFs, as\ndefined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent\nthat an investment is deemed to be an illiquid\ninvestment or a less liquid investment, the\nFund can expect to be exposed to greater\nliquidity risk. Non-U.S. Securities. The Fund\nmay purchase publicly traded common stocks of\nnon-U.S. issuers. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, the\nFund's investment in such stocks may be in the\nform of American Depositary Receipts ( \u201c ADRs\n\u201d ), Global Depositary Receipts ( \u201c GDRs \u201d )\nand European Depositary Receipts ( \u201c EDRs \u201d )\n(collectively, \u201c depositary receipts \u201d ).\nDepositary receipts are receipts, typically\nissued by a bank or trust issuer, which\nevidence ownership of underlying securities\nissued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary\nreceipts may not necessarily be denominated in\nthe same currency as their underlying\nsecurities. ADRs typically are issued by a\nU.S. bank or trust company and evidence\nownership of underlying securities issued by a\nnon-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes\nreferred to as continental depositary\nreceipts, are receipts issued in Europe,\ntypically by foreign banks and trust\ncompanies, that evidence ownership of either\nforeign or domestic underlying securities.\nGDRs are depositary receipts structured like\nglobal debt issues to facilitate trading on an\ninternational basis. Generally, ADRs, issued\nin registered form, are designed for use in\nthe U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued\nin bearer form, are designed for use in\nEuropean securities markets. GDRs are tradable\nboth in the U.S. and in Europe and are\ndesigned for use throughout the world.\nDepositary receipts are generally subject to\nthe same risks as the foreign securities that\nthey evidence or into which they may be\nconverted. In addition to investment risks\nassociated with the underlying issuer,\ndepositary receipts expose the Fund to\nadditional risks associated with the non-\nuniform terms that apply to depositary receipt\nprograms, credit exposure to the depository\nbank and to the sponsors and other parties\nwith whom the depository bank establishes the\nprograms, currency risk and liquidity risk.\nUnsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned\nby the issuer of the underlying common stock,\ngenerally expose investors to greater risks\nthan sponsored programs and do not provide\nholders with many of the shareholder benefits\nthat come from investing in a sponsored\ndepositary receipts. Investing in the\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers involves\nspecial risks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in U.S. issuers.\nThese include differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards;\nthe possibility of\n\n5\n\nexpropriation or confiscatory taxation;\nadverse changes in investment or exchange\ncontrol regulations; political instability,\nwhich could affect U.S. investments in\nnon-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions\non the flow of international capital. Non-U.S.\nissuers may be subject to less governmental\nregulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover,\nindividual non-U.S. economies may differ\nfavorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy\nin such respects as growth of gross domestic\nproduct ( \u201c GDP \u201d ), rate of inflation,\ncapital reinvestment, resource self-\nsufficiency and balance of payment positions.\nRegulation Regarding Derivatives. The CFTC\nsubjects advisers to registered investment\ncompanies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund\nthat is advised by the adviser either (i)\ninvests, directly or indirectly, more than a\nprescribed level of its liquidation value in\nCFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps ( \u201c\nCFTC Derivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent the Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. BFA is not, therefore,\nsubject to registration or regulation as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. The Fund (the \u201c No-Action\nLetter Fund \u201d ) may also have investments in \u201c\nunderlying funds \u201d (and such underlying funds\nthemselves may invest in underlying funds) not\nadvised by BFA (the term \u201c underlying fund \u201d\nfor purposes of the no-action letter\nreferenced below may include, but is not\nlimited to, certain securitized vehicles,\nmortgage or international real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ), business\ndevelopment companies and, investment\ncompanies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives\nor in any of the foregoing), and therefore may\nbe viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA\nmay not have transparency into the holdings of\nthese underlying funds because they are not\nadvised by BFA. To address this issue of lack\nof transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-\naction letter on November 29, 2012 permitting\nthe adviser of a fund that invests in such\nunderlying funds and that would otherwise have\nfiled a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC\nRule 4.5 to delay registration as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d until six months\nfrom the date on which the CFTC issues\nadditional guidance on the treatment of CFTC\nDerivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the\nadviser of the No-Action Letter Fund, expects\nto file a claim with the CFTC for the Fund to\nrely on this no-action relief. Assuming the\nCFTC does not reject such claim, BFA should\nnot be subject to registration or regulation\nas a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA\nin respect of the Fund. Derivative contracts,\nincluding, without limitation, swaps, currency\nforwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are\nsubject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n( \u201c Dodd-Frank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under\ncomparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable\nforwards and certain other derivatives traded\nin the OTC market are subject to variation\nmargin and initial margin requirements.\nImplementation of the margining and other\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding\nclearing, mandatory trading, reporting and\ndocumentation of swaps and other derivatives\nhave impacted and may continue to impact the\ncosts to the Fund of trading these instruments\nand, as a result, may affect returns to\ninvestors in the Fund. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits the Fund to\nenter into Derivatives Transactions (as\ndefined below) and certain other transactions\nnotwithstanding the restrictions on the\nissuance of \u201c senior securities \u201d under\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act.\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act,\namong other things, prohibits open-end funds,\nincluding the Fund, from issuing or selling\nany \u201c senior security, \u201d other than borrowing\nfrom a bank (subject to a requirement to\nmaintain 300% \u201c asset coverage \u201d ). Under Rule\n18f-4, \u201c Derivatives Transactions \u201d include\nthe following: (1) any swap, security-based\nswap (including a contract for differences),\nfutures contract, forward contract, option\n(excluding purchased options), any combination\nof the foregoing, or any similar instrument,\nunder which the Fund is or may be required to\nmake any payment or delivery of cash or other\nassets during the life of the instrument or at\nmaturity or early termination, whether as\nmargin or settlement payment or otherwise; (2)\nany short sale borrowing; (3) reverse\nrepurchase agreements and similar financing\ntransactions ( e.g ., recourse and non-\nrecourse tender option bonds, and borrowed\nbonds), if the Fund elects to treat these\ntransactions as Derivatives Transactions under\nRule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-\nsettling securities ( e.g. , firm and standby\ncommitments, including to-be-announced ( \u201c TBA\n\u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-\nstandard settlement cycle securities, unless\nthe Fund intends to physically settle the\ntransaction and the transaction will settle\nwithin 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\n\n6\n\nUnless the Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires the Fund\nto adopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if the Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Repurchase\nAgreements. A repurchase agreement is an\ninstrument under which the purchaser ( i.e. ,\nthe Fund) acquires a security and the seller\nagrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase\nthe security at a mutually agreed-upon time\nand price, thereby determining the yield\nduring the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by the Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Fund may suffer\ntime delays and incur costs or losses in\nconnection with the disposition of the\ncollateral. In any repurchase transaction, the\ncollateral for a repurchase agreement may\ninclude: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations\nissued by the U.S. government or its agencies\nor instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations\nthat, at the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for\nthe Fund, should it decide to utilize them.\nSuch risks are not unique to the Fund, but are\ninherent in repurchase agreements. The Fund\nseeks to minimize such risks, but because of\nthe inherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, the Fund\nwould likely retain the status of an unsecured\ncreditor of the counterparty ( i.e. , the\nposition the Fund would normally be in if it\nwere to hold, pursuant to its investment\npolicies, other unsecured debt securities of\nthe defaulting counterparty) with respect to\nthe amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured\ncreditor, the Fund would be at risk of losing\nsome or all of the principal and income\ninvolved in the transaction. Reverse\nRepurchase Agreements. Reverse repurchase\nagreements involve the sale of securities with\nan agreement to repurchase the securities at\nan agreed-upon price, date and interest\npayment and have the characteristics of\nborrowing. Generally, the effect of such\ntransactions is that the Fund can recover all\nor most of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are advantageous\nonly if the Fund has an opportunity to earn a\nrate of interest on the cash derived from\nthese transactions that is greater than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available, and the Fund intends to\nuse the reverse repurchase technique only when\nBFA believes it will be advantageous to the\nFund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements\nmay exaggerate any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s assets. The use of reverse\nrepurchase agreements is a form of leverage,\nand the proceeds obtained by the Fund through\nreverse repurchase agreements may be invested\nin additional securities. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits the Fund to\nenter into reverse repurchase agreements and\nsimilar financing transactions ( e.g.,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nborrowed bonds) notwithstanding the limitation\non the issuance of senior securities in\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act,\nprovided that the Fund either (i) complies\nwith the 300% asset coverage ratio with\nrespect to such transactions and any other\nborrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treats\nsuch transactions as Derivatives Transactions\nunder Rule 18f-4. (See \u201c Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives \u201d above.)\n\n7\n\nSecurities of Investment Companies. The Fund\nmay invest in the securities of other\ninvestment companies (including money market\nfunds) to the extent permitted by law.\nPursuant to the 1940 Act, the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment in registered investment companies\nis generally limited to, subject to certain\nexceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of any one investment company;\n(ii) 5% of the Fund\u2019s total assets with\nrespect to any one investment company; and\n(iii) 10% of the Fund\u2019s total assets with\nrespect to investment companies in the\naggregate. Other investment companies in which\nthe Fund may invest can be expected to incur\nfees and expenses for operations, such as\ninvestment advisory and administration fees,\nwhich would be in addition to those incurred\nby the Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by\nthe SEC staff, fees and expenses of money\nmarket funds used for cash collateral received\nin connection with loans of securities are not\ntreated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nwhich reflect the Fund\u2019s pro rata share of the\nfees and expenses incurred by investing in\nother investment companies (as disclosed in\nthe Prospectus, as applicable). Short-Term\nInstruments and Temporary Investments. The\nFund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, on an\nongoing basis to provide liquidity or for\nother reasons. Money market instruments are\ngenerally short-term investments that may\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) shares of\nmoney market funds (including those advised by\nBFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c\nCDs \u201d ), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed-time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nnon-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches)\nand similar institutions; (iv) commercial\npaper rated, at the date of purchase, \u201c\nPrime-1 \u201d by Moody's \u00ae Investors Service,\nInc., \u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch Ratings, Inc., or \u201c A-1\n\u201d by Standard & Poor's \u00ae Global Ratings, a\nsubsidiary of S&P Global, Inc., or if unrated,\nof comparable quality as determined by BFA;\n(v) non-convertible corporate debt securities\n( e.g. , bonds and debentures) with remaining\nmaturities at the date of purchase of not more\nthan 397 days and that have been determined to\npresent minimal credit risks, in accordance\nwith the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7\nunder the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase\nagreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-\ndenominated obligations of non-U.S. banks\n(including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion\nof BFA, are of comparable quality to\nobligations of U.S. banks that may be\npurchased by the Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions. Swap Agreements.\nSwap agreements are contracts between parties\nin which one party agrees to make periodic\npayments to the other party based on a pre-\ndetermined underlying investment or notional\namount. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the first party\nbased on the return (or a differential in rate\nof return) earned or realized on the\nunderlying investment or notional amount. Swap\nagreements will usually be performed on a net\nbasis, with the Fund receiving or paying only\nthe net amount of the two payments. The net\namount of the excess, if any, of the Fund\u2019s\nobligations over its entitlements with respect\nto each swap is accrued on a daily basis. The\nuse of swaps is a highly specialized activity\nthat involves investment techniques and risks\ndifferent from those associated with ordinary\nportfolio security transactions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets. Tracking Stocks. A tracking stock is a\nseparate class of common stock whose value is\nlinked to a specific business unit or\noperating division within a larger company and\nis designed to \u201c track \u201d the performance of\nsuch business unit or division. The tracking\nstock may pay dividends to shareholders\nindependent of the parent company. The parent\ncompany, rather than the business unit or\ndivision, generally is the issuer of tracking\nstock. However, holders of the tracking stock\nmay not have the same rights as holders of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock. Future Developments.\nThe Board may, in the future, authorize the\nFund to invest in securities contracts and\ninvestments, other than those listed in this\nSAI and in the Prospectus, provided they are\nconsistent with the Fund's investment\nobjective and do not violate any of its\ninvestment restrictions or policies. General\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of some\nof the principal risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. An investment in the Fund should\nbe made with an understanding that the value\nof the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of stocks in\n\n8\n\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause the Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. Borrowing may cause the Fund to\nliquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy its\nobligations. Commodities Investment Risk.\nExposure to commodities markets may subject\nthe Fund to greater volatility than\ninvestments in traditional securities. The\ncommodities markets have experienced periods\nof extreme volatility. Similar future market\nconditions may result in rapid and substantial\nvaluation increases or decreases in the Fund\u2019s\nholdings. The commodities markets may\nfluctuate widely based on a variety of\nfactors. Movements in commodity investment\nprices are outside of the Fund's control and\nmay not be anticipated by BFA. Price movements\nmay be influenced by, among other things:\ngovernmental, agricultural, trade, fiscal,\nmonetary and exchange control programs and\npolicies; changing market and economic\nconditions; market liquidity; weather and\nclimate conditions, including droughts and\nfloods; livestock disease; changing supply and\ndemand relationships and levels of domestic\nproduction and imported commodities; changes\nin storage costs; the availability of local,\nintrastate and interstate transportation\nsystems; energy conservation; the success of\nexploration projects; changes in international\nbalances of payments and trade; domestic and\nforeign rates of inflation; currency\ndevaluations and revaluations; domestic and\nforeign political and economic events;\ndomestic and foreign interest rates and/or\ninvestor expectations concerning interest\nrates; foreign currency/exchange rates;\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation\nand taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other\npolitical upheaval and conflicts; governmental\nexpropriation; investment and trading\nactivities of mutual funds, hedge funds and\ncommodities funds; and changes in philosophies\nand emotions of market participants. The\nfrequency and magnitude of such changes cannot\nbe predicted. The prices of commodities can\nalso fluctuate widely due to supply and demand\ndisruptions in major producing or consuming\nregions. Certain commodities or natural\nresources may be produced in a limited number\nof countries and may be controlled by a small\nnumber of producers or groups of producers. As\na result, political, economic, regulatory and\nsupply-related events in such countries could\nhave a disproportionate impact on the prices\nof such commodities. A decrease in the\nproduction of a physical commodity or a\ndecrease in the volume of such commodity\navailable for transportation, mining,\nprocessing, storage or distribution may\nadversely impact the financial performance of\na commodity or commodity-related company that\ndevotes a portion of its business to that\ncommodity. Production declines and volume\ndecreases could be caused by various factors,\nincluding catastrophic events affecting\nproduction, depletion of resources, labor\ndifficulties, environmental proceedings,\nincreased regulations, equipment failures and\nunexpected maintenance problems, import supply\ndisruption, governmental expropriation,\npolitical upheaval or conflicts or increased\ncompetition from alternative energy sources or\ncommodity prices. Agricultural commodities may\nbe adversely affected by weather or other\nnatural phenomena, such as drought, floods and\npests. A sustained decline in demand for such\ncommodities could also adversely affect the\nfinancial performance of commodity-related\ncompanies. Factors that could lead to a\ndecline in demand include economic recession\nor other adverse economic conditions, higher\ntaxes on commodities or increased governmental\nregulations, increases in fuel economy,\nconsumer shifts to the use of alternative\ncommodities or fuel sources, changes in\ncommodity prices, or weather. The commodity\nmarkets are subject to temporary distortions\nand other disruptions due to, among other\nfactors, lack of liquidity, the participation\nof speculators, and government regulation and\nother actions. U.S. futures exchanges and some\nforeign exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation in futures contract prices which\nmay occur in a single business day (generally\nreferred to as \u201c daily price fluctuation\nlimits \u201d ). The maximum or minimum price of a\ncontract as a result of these limits is\nreferred to as a \u201c limit price. \u201d If the limit\nprice has been reached in a particular\ncontract, no trades may be made beyond the\nlimit price. Limit prices have the effect of\nprecluding trading in a particular contract or\nforcing the liquidation of contracts at\ndisadvantageous times or prices. Currency\nRisk. Because the Fund's NAV is determined on\nthe basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may\nlose money if the currency of a non-U.S.\nmarket in which the Fund invests depreciates\nagainst the U.S. dollar, even if the local\ncurrency value of the Fund\u2019s holdings in that\nmarket increases. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency loses value because the currency is\nworth fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, when the\nU.S.\n\n9\n\ndollar decreases in value against a foreign\ncurrency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency gains value because the currency is\nworth more U.S. dollars. This risk, generally\nknown as \u201c currency risk, \u201d means that a\nstrong U.S. dollar will reduce returns for\nU.S. investors, while a weak U.S. dollar will\nincrease those returns. Foreign exchange\ntransactions involve a significant degree of\nrisk and the markets in which foreign exchange\ntransactions are effected are highly volatile,\nhighly specialized and highly technical.\nSignificant changes, including changes in\nliquidity and prices, can occur in such\nmarkets within very short periods of time,\noften within minutes. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the Fund\u2019s performance\nand may lower the Fund\u2019s return. The Fund\ncould experience losses if the value of its\ncurrency forward positions are poorly\ncorrelated with its other investments or if it\ncannot close out its positions because of an\nilliquid market. In addition, the Fund could\nincur transaction costs, including trading\ncommissions, in connection with certain\nnon-U.S. currency transactions. Custody Risk.\nCustody risk refers to the risks inherent in\nthe process of clearing and settling trades\nand to the holding of securities, cash and\nother assets by local banks, agents and\ndepositories. Low trading volumes and volatile\nprices in less developed markets make trades\nharder to complete and settle, and governments\nor trade groups may compel local agents to\nhold securities in designated depositories\nthat may not be subject to independent\nevaluation. Local agents are held only to the\nstandards of care of their local markets, and\nthus may be subject to limited or no\ngovernment oversight. Communications between\nthe U.S. and emerging market countries may be\nunreliable, increasing the risk of delayed\nsettlements or losses of security\ncertificates. In general, the less developed a\ncountry\u2019s securities market is, the greater\nthe likelihood of custody problems. Practices\nin relation to the settlement of securities\ntransactions in emerging markets involve\nhigher risks than those in developed markets,\nin part because of the use of brokers and\ncounterparties that are often less well\ncapitalized, and custody and registration of\nassets in some countries may be unreliable.\nThe possibility of fraud, negligence or undue\ninfluence being exerted by the issuer or\nrefusal to recognize ownership exists in some\nemerging markets, and, along with other\nfactors, could result in ownership\nregistration being lost. In addition, the laws\nof certain countries may put limits on the\nFund\u2019s ability to recover its assets if a\nforeign bank or depository or issuer of a\nsecurity or an agent of any of the foregoing\ngoes bankrupt. The Fund would absorb any loss\nresulting from such custody problems and may\nhave no successful claim for compensation.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. The Fund may not\nacquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, the Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that the Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nThe liquidity of an investment will be\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment specific considerations as set\nout in the Liquidity Program as required by\nthe Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may\ntrade at a discount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and the Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of the Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Money Market\nInstruments Risk. The Fund may hold money\nmarket instruments. The value of money market\ninstruments may be affected by changes in\ninterest rates or in the credit ratings of the\ninvestments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of the Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. It is possible to\nlose money by investing in a money market\nfund. Money market funds other than U.S.\ngovernment money market funds and retail money\nmarket funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV instead of\nusing a stable $1.00 per share price.\nOperational Risk. BFA and the Fund's other\nservice providers may experience disruptions\nor operating errors such as processing errors\nor human errors, inadequate or failed internal\nor external processes, or systems or\ntechnology failures, that could negatively\nimpact the Fund. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from the Fund\u2019s in the setting of\npriorities, the personnel and resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. BFA, through its monitoring and\noversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect\nthe Fund or to develop processes and controls\nto completely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects.\n\n10\n\nReference Rate Replacement Risk. The Fund may\nbe exposed to financial instruments that\nrecently transitioned from, or continue to be\ntied to, the London Interbank Offered Rate ( \u201c\nLIBOR \u201d ) to determine payment obligations,\nfinancing terms, hedging strategies or\ninvestment value. The United Kingdom\u2019s\nFinancial Conduct Authority ( \u201c FCA \u201d ), which\nregulates LIBOR, has ceased publishing all\nLIBOR settings. In April 2023, however, the\nFCA announced that some USD LIBOR settings\nwill continue to be published under a\nsynthetic methodology until September 30, 2024\nfor certain legacy contracts. The Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which\nis a broad measure of the cost of borrowing\ncash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities in the repurchase agreement market,\nhas been used increasingly on a voluntary\nbasis in new instruments and transactions.\nUnder U.S. regulations that implement a\nstatutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR,\nbenchmark rates based on SOFR have replaced\nLIBOR in different categories of financial\ncontracts. Neither the effect of the LIBOR\ntransition process nor its ultimate success\ncan yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-\nbased instruments may contemplate a scenario\nwhere LIBOR is no longer available by\nproviding for an alternative rate-setting\nmethodology, there may be significant\nuncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any\nsuch alternative methodologies to replicate\nLIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may have alternative rate-setting\nprovisions and there remains uncertainty\nregarding the willingness and ability of\nissuers to add alternative rate-setting\nprovisions in certain existing instruments.\nParties to contracts, securities, or other\ninstruments using LIBOR may disagree on\ntransition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. The Fund may have\ninstruments linked to other interbank offered\nrates that may also cease to be published in\nthe future. Risk of Derivatives. A derivative\nis a financial contract, the value of which\ndepends on, or is derived from, the value of\nan underlying asset, such as a security, a\ncommodity (such as gold or silver), a currency\nor an index (a measure of value or rates, such\nas the S&P 500 \u00ae or the prime lending rate).\nThe Fund may invest in futures contracts,\nsecurities options and other derivatives.\nCompared to securities, derivatives can be\nmore sensitive to changes in interest rates or\nto sudden fluctuations in market prices and\nthus the Fund\u2019s losses may be greater if it\ninvests in derivatives than if it invests only\nin conventional securities. Derivatives are\nalso subject to counterparty risk, which is\nthe risk that the other party in the\ntransaction will not fulfill its contractual\nobligations. Derivatives generally involve the\nincurrence of leverage. When a derivative is\nused as a hedge against a position that the\nFund holds or is committed to purchase, any\nloss generated by the derivative generally\nshould be substantially offset by gains on the\nhedged investment, and vice versa. While\nhedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can\nalso reduce or eliminate gains and, in some\ncases, hedging can cause losses that are not\noffset by gains, and the Fund will recognize\nlosses on both the investment and the hedge.\nHedges are sometimes subject to imperfect\nmatching between the derivative and the\nunderlying security, and there can be no\nassurance that the Fund's hedging\ntransactions, which entail additional\ntransaction costs, will be effective. Risk of\nEquity Securities. An investment in the Fund\nshould be made with an understanding of the\nrisks inherent in an investment in equity\nsecurities, including the risk that the\nfinancial condition of issuers may become\nimpaired or that the general condition of\nstock markets may deteriorate (either of which\nmay cause a decrease in the value of the\nportfolio securities and thus in the value of\nshares of the Fund). Common stocks are\nsusceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations and to increases and decreases in\nvalue as market confidence and perceptions of\ntheir issuers change. These investor\nperceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Common stocks may experience extreme\nprice volatility due to actions taken by\nparticular investors or groups of investors\n(for example, retail investors influenced by\nsocial media activity or other media coverage\nor significant \u201c short \u201d positions taken by\ninstitutional investors). Holders of common\nstocks incur more risks than holders of\npreferred stocks and debt obligations because\ncommon stockholders generally have rights to\nreceive payments from stock issuers that are\ninferior to the rights of creditors, or\nholders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (the value of which,\nhowever, is subject to market fluctuations\nprior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stocks have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity date. In addition, issuers may, in\ntimes of distress or at their own discretion,\ndecide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which\nmay also cause their stock price to decline.\nAlthough most of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index are listed on a securities\nexchange, the principal trading market for\nsome of the securities may be in the OTC\nmarket. The existence of a liquid trading\nmarket for certain securities may depend on\nwhether dealers will make a market in such\nsecurities. There can be no assurance that a\nmarket will be made or\n\n11\n\nmaintained or that any such market will be or\nremain liquid. The price at which securities\nmay be sold and the value of the Fund\u2019s shares\nwill be adversely affected if trading markets\nfor the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities are\nlimited or absent, or if bid/ask spreads are\nwide. Risk of Futures and Options on Futures\nTransactions. There are several risks\naccompanying the utilization of futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts. A\nposition in futures contracts and options on\nfutures contracts may be closed only on the\nexchange on which the contract was made (or a\nlinked exchange). While the Fund plans to\nutilize futures contracts only if an active\nmarket exists for such contracts, there is no\nguarantee that a liquid market will exist for\nthe contract at a specified time. Futures\ncontracts, by definition, project price levels\nin the future and not current levels of\nvaluation; therefore, market circumstances may\nresult in a discrepancy between the price of\nthe future and the movement in the Fund's\nUnderlying Index. In the event of adverse\nprice movements, the Fund would continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if the Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, the Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, intends to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit the risk exposure to levels\ncomparable to a direct investment in the types\nof stocks in which it invests. Utilization of\nfutures and options on futures by the Fund\ninvolves the risk of imperfect or even\nnegative correlation to the Underlying Index\nif the index underlying the futures contract\ndiffers from the Underlying Index. There is\nalso the risk of loss of margin deposits in\nthe event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom\nthe Fund has an open position in the futures\ncontract or option. The purchase of put or\ncall options will be based upon predictions by\nBFA as to anticipated trends, which\npredictions could prove to be incorrect.\nBecause the futures market generally imposes\nless burdensome margin requirements than the\nsecurities market, an increased amount of\nparticipation by speculators in the futures\nmarket could result in price fluctuations.\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day.\nThe daily limit establishes the maximum amount\nby which the price of a futures contract may\nvary either up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting the Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, the Fund\nwould be required to make daily cash payments\nof variation margin. Risk of Investing in\nNon-U.S. Equity Securities. An investment in\nthe Fund involves risks similar to those of\ninvesting in portfolios of equity securities\ntraded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks\ninclude market fluctuations caused by such\nfactors as economic and political developments\nin those foreign countries, changes in\ninterest rates and perceived trends in stock\nprices. Investing in securities issued by\nissuers domiciled in countries other than the\ndomicile of the investor and denominated in\ncurrencies other than an investor\u2019s local\ncurrency entails certain considerations and\nrisks not typically encountered by the\ninvestor in making investments in its home\ncountry and in that country\u2019s currency. These\nconsiderations include favorable or\nunfavorable changes in interest rates,\ncurrency exchange rates, exchange control\nregulations and the costs that may be incurred\nin connection with conversions between various\ncurrencies. Investing in the Fund also\ninvolves certain risks and considerations not\ntypically associated with investing in a fund\nwhose portfolio contains exclusively\nsecurities of U.S. issuers. These risks\ninclude generally less liquid and less\nefficient securities markets; generally\ngreater price volatility; less publicly\navailable information about issuers; the\nimposition of withholding or other taxes; the\nimposition of restrictions on the expatriation\nof funds or other assets of the Fund; higher\ntransaction and custody costs; delays and\nrisks attendant in settlement procedures;\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual\nobligations; lower liquidity and significantly\nsmaller market capitalization; different\naccounting and disclosure standards; lower\nlevels of regulation of the securities\nmarkets; more substantial government\ninterference with the economy and businesses;\nhigher rates of inflation; greater social,\neconomic, and political uncertainty; the risk\nof nationalization or expropriation of assets;\nand the risk of war.\n\n12\n\nRisk of Swap Agreements. The risk of loss with\nrespect to swaps is generally limited to the\nnet amount of payments that the Fund is\ncontractually obligated to make. Swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nswap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, the\nparties will have contractual remedies\npursuant to the agreements related to the\ntransaction. However, such remedies may be\nsubject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws,\nwhich could affect the Fund\u2019s rights as a\ncreditor ( e.g. , the Fund may not receive the\nnet amount of payments that it is\ncontractually entitled to receive). The Fund\nis required to post and collect variation\nmargin and initial margin (comprised of\nspecified liquid securities subject to\nhaircuts) in connection with trading of OTC\nswaps. These requirements may raise the costs\nfor the Fund\u2019s investment in swaps. Tracking\nError Risk. The Fund may be subject to\ntracking error, which is the divergence of the\nFund\u2019s performance from that of the Underlying\nIndex. Tracking error may occur because of\ndifferences between the securities and other\ninstruments held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in the Underlying Index,\npricing differences, transaction costs\nincurred by the Fund, the Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in timing of the\naccrual of or the valuation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or distributions\npaid to the Fund\u2019s shareholders, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions carried out\nto minimize the distribution of capital gains\nto shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the Underlying Index or the costs\nto the Fund of complying with various new or\nexisting regulatory requirements. This risk\nmay be heightened during times of increased\nmarket volatility or other unusual market\nconditions. Tracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and expenses,\nwhile the Underlying Index does not. Tracking\nerror may occur due to differences between the\nmethodologies used in calculating the value of\nthe Underlying Index and determining the\nFund\u2019s NAV. When an issuer is introduced by an\nindex provider into an index tracked by a\nFund, BFA may conduct an analysis on such\nissuer\u2019s securities to identify and screen for\noutlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or\nunusual price growth that does not appear to\nbe supported by publicly available information\non the business and assets of the issuer,\nunusual or significant short interest or\nlending activity, negative sentiment,\nsuspended trading or incorrect free-float\ncalculations, which could be indicators of\npossible irregularities, miscalculations or\neven fraud). If it identifies such behavior,\nBFA may, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the\nrebalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from a\nFund\u2019s portfolio and, if it does so, such Fund\nwill be subject to increased tracking error\ndue to the divergence in the securities\nincluded in its portfolio from its underlying\nindex. BFA\u2019s underweighting or excluding such\nsecurities may result in a decline in the\nFund\u2019s net asset value. The application of the\nabovementioned analysis and screening to a\nFund and its Underlying Index is in the sole\ndiscretion of BFA and its affiliates (without\nany guarantees). The analysis and screening\nmay not exclude any or all high risk\nsecurities from an Underlying Index or a\nFund\u2019s portfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\nthe Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more such\nsecurities declines in value. Volatility Risk.\nThe value of a security may fluctuate due to\nfactors affecting markets generally or\nparticular industries. This volatility may\naffect the Fund's NAV. Securities in the the\nFund's portfolio may be subject to price\nvolatility and their prices may not be any\nless volatile than the market as a whole and\ncould be more volatile. Events or financial\ncircumstances affecting individual securities\nor sectors may increase the volatility of the\nFund. Risk of Investing in Africa. Investments\nin securities of issuers in certain African\ncountries involve heightened risks including,\namong others, expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, political instability, including\nauthoritarian and/or military involvement in\ngovernmental decision-making, armed conflict,\ncivil war, and social instability as a result\nof religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic\nunrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and,\nin certain countries, genocidal warfare.\nCertain countries in Africa generally have\nless developed capital markets than\ntraditional emerging market countries, and,\nconsequently, the risks of investing in\nforeign securities are magnified in such\ncountries. Because securities markets of\ncountries in Africa are generally\nunderdeveloped and are generally less\ncorrelated to global economic cycles than\nthose markets located in more developed\ncountries, securities markets in African\ncountries are subject to greater risks\nassociated with market volatility, lower\nmarket capitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations and uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets. Moreover,\ntrading on African securities markets may be\nsuspended altogether.\n\n13\n\nMarket volatility may also be heightened by\nthe actions of a small number of investors.\nBrokerage firms in certain countries in Africa\nmay be fewer in number and less established\nthan brokerage firms in more developed\nmarkets. Since the Fund may need to effect\nsecurities transactions through these\nbrokerage firms, the Fund is subject to the\nrisk that these brokerage firms will not be\nable to fulfill their obligations to the Fund\n( i.e., counterparty risk). This risk is\nmagnified to the extent that the Fund effects\nsecurities transactions through a single\nbrokerage firm or a small number of brokerage\nfirms. Certain governments in African\ncountries restrict or control to varying\ndegrees the ability of foreign investors to\ninvest in securities of issuers located or\noperating in those countries. Moreover,\ncertain countries in Africa require\ngovernmental approval or special licenses\nprior to investment by foreign investors and\nmay limit the amount of investment by foreign\ninvestors in a particular industry and/or\nissuer, and may limit such foreign investment\nto a certain class of securities of an issuer\nthat may have less advantageous rights than\nthe classes available for purchase by domestic\ninvestors of the countries and/or impose\nadditional taxes on foreign investors. A delay\nin obtaining a government approval or a\nlicense would delay investments in a\nparticular country, and, as a result, the Fund\nmay not be able to invest in certain\nsecurities while approval is pending. The\ngovernment of a particular country may also\nwithdraw or decline to renew a license that\nenables the Fund to invest in such country.\nThese factors make investing in issuers\nlocated or operating in countries in Africa\nsignificantly riskier than investing in\nissuers located or operating in more developed\ncountries, and any one of these factors could\ncause a decline in the value of the Fund\ninvestments. Issuers located or operating in\ncountries in Africa are generally not subject\nto the same rules and regulations as issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\ncountries. Therefore, there may be less\nfinancial and other information publicly\navailable with regard to issuers located or\noperating in countries in Africa and such\nissuers are generally not subject to the\nuniform accounting, auditing and financial\nreporting standards applicable to issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\ncountries. In addition, governments of certain\ncountries in Africa in which the Fund may\ninvest may levy withholding or other taxes on\nincome such as dividends, interest and\nrealized capital gains. Although in certain\ncountries in Africa a portion of these taxes\nare recoverable, the non-recovered portion of\nforeign withholding taxes will reduce the\nincome received from investments in such\ncountries. Investment in countries in Africa\nmay be subject to a greater degree of risk\nassociated with governmental approval in\nconnection with the repatriation of investment\nincome, capital or the proceeds of sales of\nsecurities by foreign investors. In addition,\nthere is the risk that if an African country\u2019s\nbalance of payments declines, such African\ncountry may impose temporary restrictions on\nforeign capital remittances. Consequently, the\nFund could be adversely affected by delays in,\nor a refusal to grant, required governmental\napproval for repatriation of capital, as well\nas by the application to the Fund of any\nrestrictions on investments. Additionally,\ninvestments in countries in Africa may require\nthe Fund to adopt special procedures, seek\nlocal government approvals or take other\nactions, each of which may involve additional\ncosts to the Fund. Securities laws in many\ncountries in Africa are relatively new and\nunsettled and, consequently, there is a risk\nof rapid and unpredictable change in laws\nregarding foreign investment, securities\nregulation, title to securities and\nshareholder rights. Accordingly, foreign\ninvestors may be adversely affected by new or\namended laws and regulations. In addition,\nthere may be no single centralized securities\nexchange on which securities are traded in\ncertain countries in Africa and the systems of\ncorporate governance to which issuers located\nin countries in Africa are subject may be less\nadvanced than those systems to which issuers\nlocated in more developed countries are\nsubject, and, therefore, shareholders of\nissuers located in such countries may not\nreceive many of the protections available to\nshareholders of issuers located in more\ndeveloped countries. Even in circumstances\nwhere adequate laws and shareholder rights\nexist, it may not be possible to obtain swift\nand equitable enforcement of the law. In\naddition, the enforcement of systems of\ntaxation at federal, regional and local levels\nin countries in Africa may be inconsistent and\nsubject to sudden change. Certain countries in\nAfrica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. Certain countries in Africa\ndepend to a significant extent upon exports of\nprimary commodities such as gold, silver,\ncopper and diamonds. These countries therefore\nare vulnerable to changes in commodity prices,\nwhich may be affected by a variety of factors.\nIn addition, certain issuers located in\ncountries in Africa in which the Fund invests\nmay operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if\n\n14\n\nit is identified as an issuer which operates\nin, or has dealings with, such countries. The\nFund, as an investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. The\ngovernments of certain countries in Africa may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in such countries, which\ncould have a negative impact on private sector\ncompanies. There is also the possibility of\ndiplomatic developments that could adversely\naffect investments in certain countries in\nAfrica. Some countries in Africa may be\naffected by a greater degree of public\ncorruption and crime, including organized\ncrime. Political instability and protests in\nNorth Africa and the Middle East have caused\nand may in the future cause significant\ndisruptions to many industries. In addition,\nthe outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa\nseverely challenged health care industries in\nthose countries and adversely impacted the\nregion\u2019s economy due to quarantines and\ndisruptions of trade, which has further\nincreased instability in the region. This\ninstability has demonstrated that political\nand social unrest can spread quickly through\nthe region, and that developments in one\ncountry can influence the political events in\nneighboring countries. Some protests have\nturned violent, and civil war and political\nreconstruction in certain countries such as\nLibya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to\ninvestments in the region. Continued political\nand social unrest in these regions, including\nthe ongoing warfare and terrorist activities\nin the Middle East and Africa, may negatively\naffect the value of an investment in the Fund.\nRisk of Investing in Asia. Investments in\nsecurities of issuers in certain Asian\ncountries involve risks not typically\nassociated with investments in securities of\nissuers in other regions. Such heightened\nrisks include, among others, expropriation\nand/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, piracy of intellectual property,\ndata and other security breaches (especially\nof data stored electronically), political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict and social instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-\neconomic unrest. Certain Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid rates of economic growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, and there\nis no assurance that these rates of economic\ngrowth and industrialization will be\nmaintained. Certain Asian countries have\ndemocracies with relatively short histories,\nwhich may increase the risk of political\ninstability. These countries have faced\npolitical and military unrest, and further\nunrest could present a risk to their local\neconomies and securities markets. Indonesia\nand the Philippines have each experienced\nviolence and terrorism, which has negatively\nimpacted their economies. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect Asian issuers that\nrely on the U.S. for trade. Political,\nreligious, and border disputes persist in\nIndia. India has recently experienced and may\ncontinue to experience civil unrest and\nhostilities with certain of its neighboring\ncountries. Increased political and social\nunrest in these geographic areas could\nadversely affect the performance of\ninvestments in this region. Certain\ngovernments in this region administer prices\non several basic goods, including fuel and\nelectricity, within their respective\ncountries. Certain governments may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector in their respective countries\nand may own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in this\nregion, which in turn could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments adversely affecting investments\nin the region. Corruption and the perceived\nlack of a rule of law in dealings with\ninternational companies in certain Asian\ncountries may discourage foreign investment\nand could negatively impact the long-term\ngrowth of certain economies in this region. In\naddition, certain countries in the region are\nexperiencing high unemployment and corruption,\nand have fragile banking sectors. Some\neconomies in this region are dependent on a\nrange of commodities, including oil, natural\ngas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly\naffected by international commodity prices and\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. The market\nfor securities in this region may also be\ndirectly influenced by the flow of\ninternational capital, and by the economic and\nmarket conditions of neighboring countries.\nChina is a key trading partner of many Asian\ncountries and any changes in trading\nrelationships between China and other Asian\ncountries may affect the region as a whole.\nAdverse economic conditions or developments in\nneighboring countries may increase investors'\nperception of the risk of investing in the\nregion as a whole, which may adversely impact\nthe market value of the securities issued by\ncompanies in the region.\n\n15\n\nRisk of Investing in Central and South\nAmerica. The economies of certain countries in\nwhich the Fund invests are affected by the\neconomies of other Central and South American\ncountries, some of which have experienced high\ninterest rates, economic volatility,\ninflation, currency devaluations, government\ndefaults, high unemployment rates and\npolitical instability which can adversely\naffect issuers in these countries. In\naddition, commodities (such as oil, gas and\nminerals) represent a significant percentage\nof exports for the regions and many economies\nin these regions are particularly sensitive to\nfluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse\neconomic events in one country may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on some or all of\nthe countries to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe governments of certain countries in\nCentral and South America may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector and may own or control many\ncompanies. Future government actions could\nhave a significant effect on the economic\nconditions in such countries, which could have\na negative impact on the securities in which a\nFund invests. Diplomatic developments may also\nadversely affect investments in certain\ncountries in Central and South America. Some\ncountries in Central and South America may be\naffected by public corruption and crime,\nincluding organized crime. Certain countries\nin Central and South America may be heavily\ndependent upon international trade and,\nconsequently, have been and may continue to be\nnegatively affected by trade barriers,\nexchange controls, managed adjustments in\nrelative currency values and other\nprotectionist measures imposed or negotiated\nby the countries with which they trade. These\ncountries also have been and may continue to\nbe adversely affected by economic conditions\nin the countries with which they trade. In\naddition, certain issuers located in countries\nin Central and South America in which a Fund\ninvests may be the subject of sanctions (for\nexample, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on\ncertain Venezuelan individuals, corporate\nentities and the Venezuelan government) or\nhave dealings with countries subject to\nsanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S.\ngovernment and the United Nations and/or\ncountries identified by the U.S. government as\nstate sponsors of terrorism. An issuer may\nsustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer that has dealings with\nsuch countries. A Fund may be adversely\naffected if it invests in such issuers. Risk\nof Investing in China. Investments in\nsecurities of companies domiciled in China\ninvolve a high degree of risk and special\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the U.S. securities markets. Such\nheightened risks include, among others, an\nauthoritarian government, popular unrest\nassociated with demands for improved\npolitical, economic and social conditions, the\nimpact of regional conflict on the economy and\nhostile relations with neighboring countries.\nMilitary conflicts, either in response to\ninternal social unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries, could disrupt economic development.\nThe Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-\nrunning disagreements and religious and\nnationalist disputes with Tibet and the\nXinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been\ntensions between the Chinese government and\nmany people in Hong Kong who perceive China as\ntightening control over Hong Kong\u2019s semi-\nautonomous liberal political, economic, legal,\nand social framework. Recent protests and\nunrest have increased tensions even further.\nDue to the interconnected nature of the Hong\nKong and Chinese economies, this instability\nin Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong\nKong and Chinese markets. China has a complex\nterritorial dispute regarding the sovereignty\nof Taiwan and has made threats of invasion.\nTaiwan-based companies and individuals are\nsignificant investors in China. Military\nconflict between China and Taiwan may\nadversely affect securities of Chinese\nissuers. In addition, China has strained\ninternational relations with Japan, India,\nRussia and other neighbors due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities and other\ndefense concerns. Additionally, China is\nalleged to have participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Actual and\nthreatened responses to such activity and\nstrained international relations, including\npurchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. China could be affected by\nmilitary events on the Korean peninsula or\ninternal instability within North Korea. These\nsituations may cause uncertainty in the\nChinese market and may adversely affect the\nperformance of the Chinese economy. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, the Chinese government still\nexercises substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Chinese companies,\nsuch as those in the financial services or\ntechnology sectors, and potentially other\nsectors in the future, are subject to the risk\nthat Chinese authorities can intervene in\ntheir operations and structure. The Chinese\ngovernment continues to maintain a major role\nin economic policymaking. Investing in China\ninvolves risk of loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and on repatriation of\ncapital invested.\n\n16\n\nIn addition, there is less regulation and\nmonitoring of Chinese securities markets and\nthe activities of investors, brokers and other\nparticipants than in the U.S. Accordingly,\nissuers of securities in China, including\nChinese companies that are listed on U.S.\nexchanges, are not subject to the same degree\nof regulation as are U.S. issuers with respect\nto such matters as insider trading rules,\ntender offer regulation, accounting standards\nor auditor oversight, stockholder proxy\nrequirements and the requirements mandating\ntimely and accurate disclosure of information.\nSecurities markets in China are in the process\nof change and further development. This may\nlead to trading volatility, difficulty in the\nsettlement and recording of transactions and\ndifficulty in interpreting and applying the\nrelevant regulation. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund is not\nactively managed and does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. While the Chinese economy has\nexperienced past periods of rapid growth,\nthere is no assurance that such growth rates\nwill recur. China may experience substantial\nrates of inflation, significant indebtedness\nor economic recessions, causing a negative\neffect on the economy and securities market.\nChina\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on export\ngrowth. Reduction in spending on Chinese\nproducts and services, supply chain\ndiversification, institution of additional\ntariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers or\na downturn in any of the economies of China\u2019s\nkey trading partners may have an adverse\nimpact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese\nissuers of securities in which a Fund invests.\nFor example, the U.S. has added certain\nforeign technology companies to the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry\nand Security\u2019s \u201c Entity List, \u201d which is a\nlist of companies believed to pose a national\nsecurity risk to the U.S. Actions like these\nmay have unanticipated and disruptive effects\non the Chinese economy. Any such response that\ntargets Chinese financial markets or\nsecurities exchanges could interfere with\norderly trading, delay settlement or cause\nmarket disruptions. Risk of Investing in\nEastern Europe. Investing in the securities of\nissuers located or operating in Eastern Europe\nis highly speculative and involves risks not\nusually associated with investing in the more\ndeveloped markets of Western Europe. Certain\nEastern European countries have high public\ndebt levels, significant underground\neconomies, high unemployment and emigration of\nskilled workers. Such countries generally have\na history of political instability, limited\ninfrastructure and an inefficient public\nsector prone to endemic corruption. Political\nand economic reforms are too recent to\nestablish a definite trend away from centrally\nplanned economies and state-owned industries.\nIn the past, some Eastern European governments\nhave expropriated substantial amounts of\nprivate property, and many claims of the\nproperty owners have never been fully settled.\nMany Eastern European countries continue to\nmove toward market economies at different\npaces with different characteristics. Many\nEastern European securities markets are\ngenerally underdeveloped with low, irregular\ntrading volumes, dubious investor protections,\nand often a dearth of reliable corporate\ninformation. Eastern European securities\nmarkets are generally subject to less\ngovernment supervision and regulation and may\nbe less liquid and more volatile than\nsecurities markets in the U.S. or Western\nEuropean countries. Legal institutions\ngoverning private and foreign investments and\nprivate property may be relatively nascent,\ninefficient, and unevenly enforced or\ninequitably enforced. Certain Eastern European\ngovernments may exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector and\nmay own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in such\ncountries, which could have a negative impact\non the Fund\u2019s investments. Information and\ntransaction costs, differential taxes, and\nsometimes political or transfer risk give a\ncomparative advantage to the domestic investor\nrather than the foreign investor. Eastern\nEuropean economies may also be particularly\nsusceptible to changes in the international\ncredit markets due to their reliance on bank\nrelated inflows of capital. Changes to the\neconomies of countries with substantial\nforeign direct investment in certain Eastern\nEuropean countries may negatively affect the\nregion\u2019s economy. The economy of certain\nEastern European countries may be adversely\naffected by global prices for manufactured\ngoods or commodity price declines to the\nextent that a country relies on the export of\nsuch products. Geopolitical events, including\nwar, and other instability in certain Eastern\nEuropean countries may cause uncertainty in\nthe region\u2019s financial markets and adversely\naffect the performance of the issuers to which\nthe Fund has exposure. These markets may be\nparticularly sensitive to social, political,\neconomic, and currency events in Russia and\nmay suffer heavy losses as a result of their\ntrading and investment links to the Russian\neconomy and currency. Russia has historically\nasserted its influence in the region using\ndiplomatic, informational, military, and\neconomic instruments of national power, as it\ndid with Georgia in the summer of 2008 and\nUkraine beginning in 2014, and most recently\non February 24, 2022.\n\n17\n\nRussian Invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally. Risk\nof Investing in Emerging Markets. Investments\nin emerging market countries may be subject to\ngreater risks than investments in developed\ncountries. These risks include: (i) less\nsocial, political, and economic stability;\n(ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility\ndue to smaller or limited local capital\nmarkets for such securities, or low or non-\nexistent trading volumes; (iii) companies,\ncustodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges\nand broker-dealers may be subject to less\nscrutiny and regulation by local authorities;\n(iv) local governments may decide to seize or\nconfiscate securities held by foreign\ninvestors and/or local governments may decide\nto suspend or limit an issuer's ability to\nmake dividend or interest payments; (v) local\ngovernments may limit or entirely restrict\nrepatriation of invested capital, profits, and\ndividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject\nto local taxation, including on a retroactive\nbasis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on\nstandard payments imposed by local governments\nmay attempt to make dividend or interest\npayments to foreign investors in the local\ncurrency; (viii) there may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and investors may experience\ndifficulty in enforcing legal claims related\nto the securities and/or local judges may\nfavor the interests of the issuer over those\nof foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments\nmay only be permitted to be paid in the local\ncurrency; (x) limited public information\nregarding the issuer may result in greater\ndifficulty in determining market valuations of\nthe securities; and (xi) lack of financial\nreporting on a regular basis, substandard\ndisclosure and differences in accounting\nstandards may make it difficult to ascertain\nthe financial health of an issuer. The Fund is\nnot actively managed and does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. Emerging market securities\nmarkets are typically marked by a high\nconcentration of market capitalization and\ntrading volume in a small number of issuers\nrepresenting a limited number of industries,\nas well as a high concentration of ownership\nof such securities by a limited number of\ninvestors. In addition, brokerage and other\ncosts associated with transactions in emerging\nmarket securities can be higher, sometimes\nsignificantly, than similar costs incurred in\nsecurities markets in developed countries.\nAlthough some emerging markets have become\nmore established and tend to issue securities\nof higher credit quality, the markets for\nsecurities in other emerging market countries\nare in the earliest stages of their\ndevelopment, and these countries issue\nsecurities across the credit spectrum. Even\nthe markets for relatively widely traded\nsecurities in emerging market countries may\nnot be able to absorb, without price\ndisruptions, a significant increase in trading\nvolume or trades of a size customarily\nundertaken by institutional investors in the\nsecurities markets of developed countries. The\nlimited size of many of these securities\nmarkets can cause prices to be erratic for\nreasons apart from factors that affect the\nsoundness and competitiveness of the\nsecurities issuers. For example, prices may be\nunduly influenced by traders who control large\npositions in these markets. Additionally,\nmarket making and arbitrage activities are\ngenerally less extensive in such markets,\nwhich may contribute to increased volatility\nand reduced liquidity of such markets. The\nlimited liquidity of emerging market country\nsecurities may also affect the Fund's ability\nto accurately value its portfolio securities\nor to acquire or dispose of securities at the\nprice and time it wishes to do so or in order\nto meet redemption requests. Many emerging\nmarket countries suffer from uncertainty and\ncorruption in their legal frameworks.\nLegislation may be difficult to interpret and\nlaws may be too new to provide any\nprecedential value. Laws regarding foreign\ninvestment and private property may be weak or\nnon-existent. Sudden changes in governments\nmay result in policies which are less\nfavorable to investors such as policies\ndesigned to expropriate or nationalize \u201c\nsovereign \u201d assets. Certain emerging market\ncountries in the past have expropriated large\namounts of private property, in many cases\nwith little or no compensation, and there can\nbe no assurance that such expropriation will\nnot occur in the future. Investment in the\nsecurities markets of certain emerging market\ncountries is restricted or controlled to\nvarying degrees. These restrictions may limit\nthe Fund's investment in certain emerging\nmarket countries and may increase the expenses\nof the Fund. Certain emerging market countries\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestments by foreign persons or limit\n\n18\n\ninvestment by foreign persons to only a\nspecified percentage of an issuer's\noutstanding securities or a specific class of\nsecurities which may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\ncompany available for purchase by nationals.\nMany emerging market countries lack the\nsocial, political, and economic stability\ncharacteristic of the U.S. Political\ninstability among emerging market countries\ncan be common and may be caused by an uneven\ndistribution of wealth, social unrest, labor\nstrikes, civil wars, and religious oppression.\nEconomic instability in emerging market\ncountries may take the form of: (i) high\ninterest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation,\nincluding hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of\nunemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes\nin government economic and tax policies,\nincluding confiscatory taxation; and (v)\nimposition of trade barriers. The Fund's\nincome and, in some cases, capital gains from\nforeign securities will be subject to\napplicable taxation in certain of the emerging\nmarket countries in which it invests, and\ntreaties between the U.S. and such countries\nmay not be available in some cases to reduce\nthe otherwise applicable tax rates. Emerging\nmarkets also have different clearance and\nsettlement procedures, and in certain of these\nemerging markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of securities transactions, making\nit difficult to conduct such transactions. In\nthe past, certain governments in emerging\nmarket countries have become overly reliant on\nthe international capital markets and other\nforms of foreign credit to finance large\npublic spending programs, which in the past\nhave caused huge budget deficits. Often,\ninterest payments have become too overwhelming\nfor a government to meet, representing a large\npercentage of total GDP. These foreign\nobligations have become the subject of\npolitical debate and served as fuel for\npolitical parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\nRisk of Investing in the Middle East. Many\nMiddle Eastern countries have little or no\ndemocratic tradition, and the political and\nlegal systems in such countries may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund. Many economies in\nthe Middle East are highly reliant on income\nfrom the sale of oil and natural gas or trade\nwith countries involved in the sale of oil and\nnatural gas, and their economies are therefore\nvulnerable to changes in the market for oil\nand natural gas and foreign currency values.\nAs global demand for oil and natural gas\nfluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may\nbe significantly impacted. In addition, many\nMiddle Eastern governments have exercised and\ncontinue to exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector. In\ncertain cases, a Middle Eastern country\u2019s\ngovernment may own or control many companies,\nincluding some of the largest companies in the\ncountry. Accordingly, governmental actions in\nthe future could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Middle Eastern\ncountries. This could affect private sector\ncompanies and the Fund, as well as the value\nof securities in the Fund's portfolio. Certain\nMiddle Eastern markets are in the earliest\nstages of development. As a result, there may\nbe a high concentration of market\ncapitalization and trading volume in a small\nnumber of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of investors and financial\nintermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern\ncountries typically are fewer in number and\nless capitalized than brokers in the U.S. The\nlegal systems in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries also may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund. For example, the potential liability\nof a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with\nrespect to acts of the corporation generally\nis limited to the amount of the shareholder\u2019s\ninvestment. However, the notion of limited\nliability is less clear in certain Middle\nEastern countries. The Fund therefore may be\nliable in certain Middle Eastern countries for\nthe acts of a corporation in which it invests\nfor an amount greater than its actual\ninvestment in that corporation. Similarly, the\nrights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers\nmay be more limited than those of shareholders\nof a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain or enforce a legal\njudgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some\nMiddle Eastern countries prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on investments in\ntheir capital markets, particularly their\nequity markets, by foreign entities such as\nthe Fund. For example, certain countries may\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestment by foreign persons or limit the\namount of investment by foreign persons in a\nparticular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern\ncountries may also limit investment by foreign\n\n19\n\npersons to only a specific class of securities\nof an issuer that may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\nissuer available for purchase by nationals of\nthe relevant Middle Eastern country. The\nmanner in which foreign investors may invest\nin companies in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries, as well as limitations on those\ninvestments, may have an adverse impact on the\noperations of the Fund. For example, in\ncertain of these countries, the Fund may be\nrequired to invest initially through a local\nbroker or other entity and then have the\nshares that were purchased re-registered in\nthe name of the Fund. Re-registration in some\ninstances may not be possible on a timely\nbasis. This may result in a delay during which\nthe Fund may be denied certain of its rights\nas an investor, including rights as to\ndividends or to be made aware of certain\ncorporate actions. There also may be instances\nwhere the Fund places a purchase order but is\nsubsequently informed, at the time of re-\nregistration, that the permissible allocation\nof the investment to foreign investors has\nalready been filled and, consequently, the\nFund may not be able to invest in the relevant\ncompany. Substantial limitations may exist in\ncertain Middle Eastern countries with respect\nto the Fund\u2019s ability to repatriate investment\nincome or capital gains. The Fund could be\nadversely affected by delays in, or a refusal\nto grant, any required governmental approval\nfor repatriation of capital, as well as by the\napplication to the Fund of any restrictions on\ninvestment. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nmay be heavily dependent upon international\ntrade and, consequently, have been and may\ncontinue to be negatively affected by trade\nbarriers, exchange controls, managed\nadjustments in relative currency values and\nother protectionist measures imposed or\nnegotiated by the countries with which they\ntrade. These countries also have been and may\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by economic\nconditions in the countries with which they\ntrade. In addition, certain issuers located in\nMiddle Eastern countries in which the Fund\ninvests may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer which operates in, or\nhas dealings with, such countries. The Fund,\nas an investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. Certain\nMiddle Eastern countries have strained\nrelations with other Middle Eastern countries\ndue to territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, international alliances, defense\nconcerns or other reasons, which may adversely\naffect the economies of these Middle Eastern\ncountries. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nexperience significant unemployment, as well\nas widespread underemployment. There has also\nbeen a recent increase in recruitment efforts\nand an aggressive push for territorial control\nby terrorist groups in the region, which has\nled to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities.\nWarfare in Syria has spread to surrounding\nareas, including many portions of Iraq and\nTurkey. Such hostilities may continue into the\nfuture or may escalate at any time due to\nethnic, racial, political, religious or\nideological tensions between groups in the\nregion or foreign intervention or lack of\nintervention, among other factors. Risk of\nInvesting in Saudi Arabia. The Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index includes Saudi Arabian equity\nsecurities. The ability of foreign investors\n(such as the Fund) to invest in the securities\nof Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new.\nSuch ability could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership in such securities. In\naddition, the Capital Market Authority ( \u201c CMA\n\u201d ) places investment limitations on the\nownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers by foreign investors, including a\nlimitation on the Fund\u2019s ownership of the\nsecurities of any single issuer listed on the\nSaudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may\nprevent the Fund from investing in accordance\nwith its strategy and contribute to tracking\nerror against the Underlying Index. These\nrestrictions may be changed or new\nrestrictions, such as licensing requirements,\nspecial approvals or additional foreign taxes,\nmay be instituted at any time. The Fund may\nnot be able to obtain or maintain any such\nlicenses or approvals and may not be able to\nbuy and sell securities at full value. Major\ndisruptions or regulatory changes could occur\nin the Saudi Arabian market, any of which\ncould negatively impact the Fund. These risks\nmay be exacerbated, compared to more developed\nmarkets, given the limited history of foreign\ninvestment in the Saudi Arabian market.\nInvestments in Saudi Arabia may also be\nsubject to loss due to expropriation or\nnationalization of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on additional\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital. Such heightened risks may include,\namong others, restrictions on and government\nintervention in international trade,\nconfiscatory taxation, political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision making,\narmed conflict, crime and instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has\nprivatized, or has begun the process of\nprivatizing, certain entities and industries.\nNewly privatized companies may face strong\ncompetition from government-sponsored\ncompetitors that have not been privatized. In\nsome instances, investors in newly privatized\nentities have suffered losses due to the\ninability of the newly privatized entities to\nadjust quickly to a competitive environment or\nchanging regulatory and legal standards or, in\nsome cases, due to re-nationalization of such\nprivatized entities. There is no assurance\nthat similar losses will not recur. Further,\nunder income tax\n\n20\n\nlaws imposed by the General Authority of Zakat\nand Tax, dividends paid by a Saudi Arabian\ncompany to foreign stockholders are generally\nsubject to a 5% withholding tax (different tax\nrates may apply pursuant to an applicable\ntreaty). Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on\nincome from the sale of petroleum and trade\nwith other countries involved in the sale of\npetroleum, and its economy is therefore\nvulnerable to changes in foreign currency\nvalues and the market for petroleum, as well\nas acts targeting petroleum production or\nprocessing facilities in Saudi Arabia. As\nglobal demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi\nArabia may be significantly impacted. In the\nrecent past, the Saudi Arabian government has\nexplored privatization and diversification of\nthe economy in the wake of a diminished\npetroleum market. Like most Middle Eastern\ngovernments, the government of Saudi Arabia\nexercises substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector. Although\nliberalization in the wider economy is\nunderway, in many areas it has lagged\nsignificantly: restrictions on foreign\nownership persist, and the government has an\nownership stake in many key industries. The\nsituation is exacerbated by the fact that\nSaudi Arabia is governed by an absolute\nmonarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Incidents involving a Middle Eastern\ncountry\u2019s or the region\u2019s security, including\nterrorism, may cause uncertainty in their\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. Governmental\nactions in the future could have a significant\neffect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia,\nwhich could affect private sector companies\nand the Fund, as well as the value of\nsecurities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio. Any\neconomic sanctions on Saudi Arabian\nindividuals or Saudi Arabian corporate\nentities, or even the threat of sanctions, may\nresult in the decline of the value and\nliquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a\nweakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse\nconsequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. Any\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Saudi Arabian securities and/or\nfunds investing in prohibited assets,\nimpairing the ability of the Fund to buy,\nsell, receive or deliver those securities\nand/or assets. In addition, Saudi Arabia\u2019s\neconomy relies heavily on cheap, foreign\nlabor, and changes in the availability of this\nlabor supply could have an adverse effect on\nthe economy. The securities markets in Saudi\nArabia may not be as developed as those in\nother countries. As a result, securities\nmarkets in Saudi Arabia are subject to greater\nrisks associated with market volatility, lower\nmarket capitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations, uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets, governmental\ncontrol and heavy regulation of labor and\nindustry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian\ncompanies tend to trade less frequently than\nthose of companies on exchanges in more\ndeveloped markets. Such infrequent trading may\nadversely affect the pricing of these\nsecurities and the Fund\u2019s ability to sell\nthese securities in the future. Although the\npolitical situation in Saudi Arabia is largely\nstable, Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced political instability, and there\nremains the possibility that the stability\nwill not hold in the future or that\ninstability in the larger Middle East region\ncould adversely impact the economy of Saudi\nArabia. Instability may be caused by military\ndevelopments, government interventions in the\nmarketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes,\nattempted social or political reforms,\nreligious differences, or other factors.\nAdditionally, anti-Western views held by\ncertain groups in the Middle East may\ninfluence government policies regarding\nforeign investment. Further developments in\nU.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other\nMiddle-Eastern countries may affect these\nattitudes and policies. The U.S. is a\nsignificant trading partner of, or foreign\ninvestor in, Saudi Arabia. As a result,\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be\nparticularly affected by changes in the U.S.\neconomy. A decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, new trade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar\nexchange rate or an economic slowdown in the\nU.S. may have a material adverse effect on the\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a\nresult, securities to which the Fund has\nexposure. Political instability in North\nAfrica and the larger Middle East region has\ncaused significant disruptions to many\nindustries. Continued political and social\nunrest in these areas may negatively affect\nthe value of securities in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Certain issuers located in Saudi\nArabia may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain\ndamage to its reputation if it is identified\nas an issuer which operates in, or has\ndealings with, such countries. The Fund, as an\ninvestor in such issuers, will be indirectly\nsubject to those risks. Risk of Investing in\nthe Consumer Discretionary Sector. Companies\nengaged in the design, production or\ndistribution of products or services for the\nconsumer discretionary sector (including,\nwithout limitation, television and radio\nbroadcasting, manufacturing, publishing,\nrecording and musical instruments, motion\npictures, photography, amusement and theme\nparks,\n\n21\n\ngaming casinos, sporting goods and sports\narenas, camping and recreational equipment,\ntoys and games, apparel, travel-related\nservices, automobiles, hotels and motels, and\nfast food and other restaurants) are subject\nto the risk that their products or services\nmay become obsolete quickly. The success of\nthese companies can depend heavily on\ndisposable household income and consumer\nspending. During periods of an expanding\neconomy, the consumer discretionary sector may\noutperform the consumer staples sector, but\nmay underperform when economic conditions\nworsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary\nsector can be significantly affected by\nseveral factors, including, without\nlimitation, the performance of domestic and\ninternational economies, exchange rates,\nchanging consumer preferences, demographics,\nmarketing campaigns, cyclical revenue\ngeneration, consumer confidence, commodity\nprice volatility, labor relations, interest\nrates, import and export controls, intense\ncompetition, technological developments and\ngovernment regulation. Risk of Investing in\nthe Consumer Staples Sector. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector may be adversely\naffected by changes in the global economy,\nconsumer spending, competition, demographics\nand consumer preferences, and production\nspending. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may also be affected by changes in\nglobal economic, environmental and political\nevents, economic conditions, the depletion of\nresources, and government regulation. For\ninstance, government regulations may affect\nthe permissibility of using various food\nadditives and production methods of companies\nthat make food products, which could affect\ncompany profitability. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector also may be subject to\nrisks pertaining to the supply of, demand for\nand prices of raw materials. The prices of raw\nmaterials fluctuate in response to a number of\nfactors, including, without limitation,\nchanges in government agricultural support\nprograms, exchange rates, import and export\ncontrols, changes in international\nagricultural and trading policies, and\nseasonal and weather conditions. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector may be subject to\nsevere competition, which may also have an\nadverse impact on their profitability. Risk of\nInvesting in the Energy Sector. Companies in\nthe energy sector are strongly affected by the\nchanges in and volatility of global energy\nprices, energy supply and demand, government\nregulations and policies, energy production\nand conservation efforts, technological\nchange, development of alternative energy\nsources, and other factors that they cannot\ncontrol. Energy companies may have relatively\nhigh levels of debt and may be more likely to\nrestructure their businesses if there are\ndownturns in energy markets or in the global\neconomy. If an energy company in the Fund's\nportfolio becomes distressed, the Fund could\nlose all or a substantial portion of its\ninvestment. The energy sector is cyclical and\nis highly dependent on commodity prices.\nPrices and supplies of energy may fluctuate\nsignificantly over short and long periods of\ntime due to, among other things, national and\ninternational political changes, Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d )\npolicies, changes in relationships among OPEC\nmembers and between OPEC and oil-importing\nnations, the regulatory environment, taxation\npolicies, the enactment or cessation of trade\nsanctions, war or other geopolitical\nconflicts, and the economies of key energy-\nconsuming countries. Companies in the energy\nsector may be adversely affected by terrorism,\ncyber incidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to\n\n22\n\npredict and depend on a number of factors. The\neffect of these events or any related\ndevelopments could be significant and may have\na severe adverse effect on the performance of\nthe Fund. Risk of Investing in the Financials\nSector. Companies in the financials sector\ninclude small, regional and money center\nbanks, securities brokerage firms, asset\nmanagement companies, savings banks and thrift\ninstitutions, specialty finance companies (\ne.g. , credit card, mortgage providers),\ninsurance and insurance brokerage firms,\nconsumer finance firms, financial\nconglomerates and foreign banking and\nfinancial companies. Most financial companies\nare subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which limits their activities and\nmay affect their ability to earn a profit from\na given line of business. Government\nregulation may change frequently and may have\nsignificant adverse consequences for companies\nin the financials sector, including effects\nnot intended by the regulation. Direct\ngovernmental intervention in the operations of\nfinancial companies and financial markets may\nmaterially and adversely affect the companies\nin which the Fund invests, including\nlegislation in many countries that may\nincrease government regulation, repatriation\nand other intervention. The impact of\ngovernmental intervention and legislative\nchanges on any individual financial company or\non the financials sector as a whole cannot be\npredicted. The valuation of financial\ncompanies has been and continues to be subject\nto unprecedented volatility and may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors, including\ninterest rate risk and sovereign debt default.\nCertain financial businesses are subject to\nintense competitive pressures, including\nmarket share and price competition. Financial\ncompanies in foreign countries are subject to\nmarket-specific and general regulatory and\ninterest rate concerns. In particular,\ngovernment regulation in certain foreign\ncountries may include taxes and controls on\ninterest rates, credit availability, minimum\ncapital requirements, bans on short sales,\nlimits on prices and restrictions on currency\ntransfers. In addition, companies in the\nfinancials sector may be the targets of\nhacking and potential theft of proprietary or\ncustomer information or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a material adverse\neffect on their businesses. The profitability\nof banks, savings and loan associations and\nother financial companies is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change; for instance, when interest\nrates go up, the value of securities issued by\nmany types of companies in the financials\nsector generally goes down. In other words,\nfinancial companies may be adversely affected\nin certain market cycles, including, without\nlimitation, during periods of rising interest\nrates, which may restrict the availability and\nincrease the cost of capital, and during\nperiods of declining economic conditions,\nwhich may cause, among other things, credit\nlosses due to financial difficulties of\nborrowers. In addition, general economic\nconditions are important to the operations of\nthese companies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products.\n\n23\n\nPatents have a limited duration, and, upon\nexpiration, other companies may market\nsubstantially similar \u201c generic \u201d products\nthat are typically sold at a lower price than\nthe patented product, which can cause the\noriginal developer of the product to lose\nmarket share and/or reduce the price charged\nfor the product, resulting in lower profits\nfor the original developer. As a result, the\nexpiration of patents may adversely affect the\nprofitability of these companies. In addition,\nbecause the products and services of many\ncompanies in the healthcare sector affect the\nhealth and well-being of many individuals,\nthese companies are especially susceptible to\nextensive litigation based on product\nliability and similar claims. Healthcare\ncompanies are subject to competitive forces\nthat may make it difficult to raise prices\nand, in fact, may result in price discounting.\nMany new products in the healthcare sector may\nbe subject to regulatory approvals. The\nprocess of obtaining such approvals may be\nlong and costly, which can result in increased\ndevelopment costs, delayed cost recovery and\nloss of competitive advantage to the extent\nthat rival companies have developed competing\nproducts or procedures, adversely affecting\nthe company\u2019s revenues and profitability. In\nother words, delays in the regulatory approval\nprocess may diminish the opportunity for a\ncompany to profit from a new product or to\nbring a new product to market, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on a company\u2019s\nbusiness. Healthcare companies may also be\nstrongly affected by scientific biotechnology\nor technological developments, and their\nproducts may quickly become obsolete. Also,\nmany healthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Industrials Sector. The value\nof securities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply of and demand for both their\nspecific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, companies in the industrials\nsector may be subject to liability for\nenvironmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Materials Sector.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control,\namong other factors. Such risks may adversely\naffect the issuers to which the Fund has\nexposure. Companies in the materials sector\nare also at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in the Real\nEstate Industry. Companies in the real estate\nindustry include companies that invest in real\nestate, such as REITs, real estate holding and\noperating companies or real estate development\ncompanies (collectively, \u201c Real Estate\nCompanies \u201d ). Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies exposes investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly, as well as to\nrisks that relate specifically to the way in\nwhich Real Estate Companies are organized and\noperated. The real estate industry is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and developments, and characterized\nby intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies involves various risks. Some risks\nthat are specific to Real Estate Companies are\ndiscussed in greater detail below.\n\n24\n\nConcentration Risk. Real Estate Companies may\nown a limited number of properties and\nconcentrate their investments in a particular\ngeographic region or property type. Economic\ndownturns affecting a particular region,\nindustry or property type may lead to a high\nvolume of defaults within a short period.\nDistressed Investment Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in distressed, defaulted\nor out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and\nimplementation by a Real Estate Company of\nloan modification and restructure programs\ninvolves a high degree of uncertainty. Even\nsuccessful implementation may still require\nadverse compromises and may not prevent\nbankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also\ninvest in other debt instruments that may\nbecome non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt or erratic\nprice fluctuations. In addition, real estate\nis relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other capital\nexpenditures, the income and ability of a Real\nEstate Company to make payments of any\ninterest and principal on its debt securities\nwill be adversely affected. Loan Foreclosure\nRisk. Real Estate Companies may foreclose on\nloans that the Real Estate Company originated\nand/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate\nnegative publicity for the underlying property\nthat affects its market value. In addition to\nthe length and expense of such proceedings,\nthe validity of the terms of the applicable\nloan may not be recognized in foreclosure\nproceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by\nborrowers or other lenders may interfere with\nthe enforcement of rights by a Real Estate\nCompany. Parallel proceedings, such as\nbankruptcy, may also delay resolution and\nlimit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed\nloan by a Real Estate Company even where the\nproperty underlying the loan is liquidated.\nManagement Risk. Real Estate Companies are\ndependent upon management skills and may have\nlimited financial resources. Real Estate\nCompanies are generally not diversified and\nmay be subject to heavy cash flow dependency,\ndefault by borrowers and voluntary\nliquidation. In addition, transactions between\nReal Estate Companies and their affiliates may\nbe subject to conflicts of interest, which may\nadversely affect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\nshareholders. A Real Estate Company may also\nhave joint venture investments in certain of\nits properties, and, consequently, its ability\nto control decisions relating to such\nproperties may be limited. Property Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may be subject to risks\nrelating to functional obsolescence or reduced\ndesirability of properties; extended vacancies\ndue to economic conditions and tenant\nbankruptcies; catastrophic events such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts;\nand casualty or condemnation losses. Real\nestate income and values also may be greatly\naffected by demographic trends, such as\npopulation shifts or changes in consumer\npreferences and values, or increasing\nvacancies or declining rents resulting from\nlegal, cultural, technological, global or\nlocal economic developments. Regulatory Risk.\nReal estate income and values may be adversely\naffected by such factors as applicable\ndomestic and foreign laws (including tax\nlaws). Government actions, such as tax\nincreases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other commercial restrictions or\nenvironmental regulations, also may have a\nmajor impact on real estate income and values.\nIn addition, quarterly compliance with\nregulations limiting the proportion of asset\ntypes held by a U.S. REIT may force certain\nReal Estate Companies to liquidate or\nrestructure otherwise attractive investments.\nSome countries may not recognize REITs or\ncomparable structures as a viable form of real\nestate funds.\n\n25\n\nUnderlying Investment Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies make investments in a variety of\ndebt and equity instruments with varying risk\nprofiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies\nmay invest in debt instruments secured by\ncommercial property that have higher risks of\ndelinquency and foreclosure than loans on\nsingle family homes due to a variety of\nfactors associated with commercial property,\nincluding the tie between income available to\nservice debt and productive use of the\nproperty. Real Estate Companies may also\ninvest in debt instruments and preferred\nequity that are junior in an issuer\u2019s capital\nstructure and that involve privately\nnegotiated structures. Subordinated debt\ninvestments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine\nloans, involve a greater credit risk of\ndefault due to the need to service more senior\ndebt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred\nequity investments involve a greater risk of\nloss than conventional debt financing due to\ntheir non-collateralized nature and\nsubordinated ranking. Investments in\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities may also\nbe junior in priority in the event of\nbankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments\nin senior loans may be effectively\nsubordinated if the senior loan is pledged as\ncollateral. The ability of a holder of junior\nclaims to proceed against a defaulting issuer\nis circumscribed by the terms of the\nparticular contractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nA REIT that successfully maintains its\nqualification may still become subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes, including\nexcise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage\nrecording, and transfer taxes, both directly\nand indirectly through its subsidiaries.\nBecause REITs often do not provide complete\ntax information until after the calendar year-\nend, the Fund may at times need to request\npermission to extend the deadline for issuing\nyour tax reporting statement or supplement the\ninformation otherwise provided to you. Risk of\nInvesting in the Technology Sector. Technology\ncompanies are characterized by periodic new\nproduct introductions, innovations and\nevolving industry standards, and, as a result,\nface intense competition, both domestically\nand internationally, which may have an adverse\neffect on profit margins. Companies in the\ntechnology sector are often smaller and less\nexperienced companies and may be subject to\ngreater risks than larger companies; these\nrisks may be heightened for technology\ncompanies in foreign markets. Technology\ncompanies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel. The\nproducts of technology companies may face\nproduct obsolescence due to rapid\ntechnological developments and frequent new\nproduct introduction, changes in consumer and\nbusiness purchasing patterns, unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for\nthe services of qualified personnel. In\naddition, a rising interest rate environment\ntends to negatively affect companies in the\ntechnology sector because, in such an\nenvironment, those companies with high market\nvaluations may appear less attractive to\ninvestors, which may cause sharp decreases in\nthe companies\u2019 market prices. Companies in the\ntechnology sector are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights. The\nloss or impairment of these rights may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. Companies in the technology sector\nare facing increased government and regulatory\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or regulatory action. The\ntechnology sector may also be adversely\naffected by changes or trends in commodity\nprices, which may be influenced or\ncharacterized by unpredictable factors.\nFinally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the technology sector may\nbe particular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nRisk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. The\nutilities sector may be adversely affected by\nchanging commodity prices, government\nregulation stipulating rates charged by\nutilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax\nlaws, interest rate fluctuations and changes\nin the cost of providing specific utility\nservices. The utilities industry is also\nsubject to potential terrorist attacks,\nnatural disasters and severe weather\nconditions, as well as regulatory and\noperational burdens associated with the\noperation and maintenance of nuclear\nfacilities. Government regulators monitor and\ncontrol utility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility profits. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in the Fund's portfolio may own or\noperate nuclear generating facilities.\nGovernmental authorities may from time to time\nreview existing policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\n\n26\n\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policy For the Fund, the Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities to BFA pursuant to the Fund's Proxy\nVoting Policy, and BFA has adopted policies\nand procedures (collectively, the \u201c iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d ) governing proxy\nvoting by accounts managed by BFA, including\nthe Fund. Under the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting\nPolicies, BFA will vote proxies related to\nFund securities in the best interests of the\nFund and its shareholders. From time to time,\na vote may present a conflict between the\ninterests of the Fund\u2019s shareholders, on the\none hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated\nperson of the Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA\nmaintains policies and procedures that are\ndesigned to prevent undue influence on BFA\u2019s\nproxy voting activity that might stem from any\nrelationship between the issuer of a proxy (or\nany dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s\naffiliates, the Fund or the Fund\u2019s affiliates.\nMost conflicts are managed through a\nstructural separation of BFA\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Group from BFA\u2019s employees with\nsales and client responsibilities. In\naddition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure\nthat all engagements with corporate issuers or\ndissident shareholders are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BFA\u2019s\nrelationship with the issuer of the proxy or\nthe dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Fund's portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ending\nJune 30 will be available: (i) without charge,\nupon request, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Fund's website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, the Fund discloses\non its website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of the Fund\u2019s next\nnet asset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: The Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of the Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to the Fund to\nsettle purchases of the Fund ( i.e. Deposit\nSecurities) or that Authorized Participants\nwould receive from the Fund to settle\nredemptions of the Fund ( i.e. Fund\nSecurities). These files are known as the\nPortfolio Composition File and the Fund Data\nFile (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The Files are\napplicable for the next trading day and are\nprovided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an\n\n27\n\nAuthorized Participant or liquidity provider\nthe securities the Fund is willing to accept\nfor a creation, and securities that the Fund\nwill provide on a redemption. BFA employees\nmay also discuss portfolio holdings-related\ninformation with broker/dealers, in connection\nwith settling the Fund\u2019s transactions, as may\nbe necessary to conduct business in the\nordinary course in a manner consistent with\nthe disclosure in the Fund's current\nregistration statement. \u2022 Communications with\nListing Exchanges: From time to time,\nemployees of BFA may discuss portfolio\nholdings information with the applicable\nprimary listing exchange for the Fund as\nneeded to meet the exchange listing standards.\n\u2022 Communications with Other Portfolio\nManagers: Certain information may be provided\nto employees of BFA who manage funds that\ninvest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFund, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Fund, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain the Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of the Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio-level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nConstruction and Maintenance of the Underlying\nIndex A description of the Underlying Index is\nprovided below. With respect to certain\nunderlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA\nor its affiliates have held discussions with\nthe applicable index provider regarding their\nbusiness interest in licensing an index to\ntrack a particular market segment and conveyed\ninvestment concepts and strategies that could\nbe considered for the index. The index\nprovider designed and constituted such indices\nusing concepts conveyed by BFA or its\naffiliates. For certain of these indices, the\nrelevant fund may be the first or sole user of\nthe underlying index. In its sole discretion,\nthe index provider determines the composition\nof the securities and other instruments in\nsuch underlying index, the rebalance protocols\nof the underlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and other instruments in the\nunderlying index, and any updates to the\nmethodology. From time to time, BFA or its\naffiliates may also provide input relating to\npossible methodology changes of such\nunderlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\n\n28\n\nThe MSCI Indexes The MSCI indexes were founded\nin 1969 by Capital International S.A. as\ninternational performance benchmarks\nconstructed to facilitate comparison of world\nmarkets. The MSCI single country standard\nequity indexes have covered the world's\ndeveloped markets since 1969 and in 1987 MSCI\ncommenced coverage of emerging markets. Local\nstock exchanges traditionally calculated their\nown indexes, which were generally not\ncomparable with one another due to differences\nin the representation of the local market,\nmathematical formulas, base dates and methods\nof adjusting for capital changes. MSCI,\nhowever, applies the same calculation\nmethodology to all markets for all single\ncountry standard equity indexes, both\ndeveloped and emerging. MSCI Global Investable\nMarket Indexes MSCI's Global Investable Market\nIndexes (the \u201c MSCI GIMI \u201d ) provide coverage\nand non-overlapping market segmentation by\nmarket capitalization size and by style. The\nMSCI GIMI intend to target approximately 99%\ncoverage of the free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization in each market of large-, mid-\nand small-cap securities. In each market, MSCI\ncreates an Investable Market Index, Standard\nIndex, Large Cap Index, Mid Cap Index and\nSmall Cap Index. The Standard Index, Large Cap\nIndex, Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index are\neach subsets of the Investable Market Index\nfor a market. The MSCI Global Standard Index\nis the aggregation of the Large Cap Index and\nMid Cap Index and the MSCI GIMI is the\naggregation of the MSCI Global Standard Index\nand MSCI Global Small Cap Index. Selection\nCriteria. MSCI's index construction process\ninvolves: (i) defining the equity universe;\n(ii) determining the market investable equity\nuniverse for each market; (iii) determining\nmarket capitalization size segments for each\nmarket; (iv) applying final size segment\ninvestability requirements; and (v) applying\nindex continuity rules for the MSCI Global\nStandard Index. Defining the Equity Universe .\nMSCI begins with securities listed in\ncountries in the MSCI GIMI. As of June 8,\n2023, 23 are classified as developed markets,\n24 as emerging markets, and 21 as frontier\nmarkets (frontier markets exclude the West\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Union, which\nconsists of securities classified in Benin,\nBurkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau,\nMali, Niger, Senegal and Togo). All listed\nequity securities and listed securities that\nexhibit characteristics of equity securities,\nexcept mutual funds, ETFs, equity derivatives,\nlimited partnerships and most investment\ntrusts, are eligible for inclusion in the\nequity universe. REITs in some countries and\ncertain income trusts in Canada are also\neligible for inclusion. Each company and its\nsecurities ( i.e ., share classes) are\nclassified in only one country. Determining\nthe Market Investable Equity Universe for Each\nMarket. The equity universe in any market is\nderived by applying investability screens to\nindividual companies and securities in that\nmarket. Some investability requirements are\napplied at the individual security level and\nsome at the overall company level, represented\nby the aggregation of individual securities of\nthe company. As a result, the inclusion or\nexclusion of one security does not imply the\nautomatic inclusion or exclusion of other\nsecurities of the same company. Determining\nMarket Capitalization Size Segments for Each\nMarket. In order to create size components\nthat can be meaningfully aggregated into\ncomposites, individual market size segments\nbalance the following two objectives: \u2022\nAchieving global size integrity by ensuring\nthat companies of comparable and relevant\nsizes are included in a given size segment\nacross all markets in a composite index; and \u2022\nAchieving consistent market coverage by\nensuring that each market's size segment is\nrepresented in its proportional weight in the\ncomposite universe. The Standard Indexes,\nLarge Cap Indexes, Mid Cap Indexes, and Small\nCap Indexes capture the following market\ncapitalization size segments: \u2022 MSCI Global\nStandard Indexes cover all investable large-\nand mid-cap securities by including the\nlargest issuers comprising approximately 85%\nof each market\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. \u2022 MSCI Global Large Cap\nIndexes provide coverage of all investable\nlarge-cap securities by including the largest\nissuers comprising approximately 70% of each\nmarket\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. \u2022 MSCI Global Mid Cap Indexes\nprovide coverage in each market by deriving\nthe difference between the market coverage of\nthe MSCI Global Standard Index and the MSCI\nGlobal Large Cap Index in that market.\n\n29\n\n\u2022 MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes provide\ncoverage of companies with a market\ncapitalization below that of the companies in\nthe MSCI Global Standard Indexes. Applying\nFinal Size Segment Investability Requirements.\nIn order to enhance replicability of the\nindexes, additional size segment investability\nrequirements are set for the MSCI GIMI and\nMSCI Global Standard Index. These\ninvestability requirements include minimum\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization,\nminimum liquidity, minimum foreign limits and\nminimum length of trading. Applying Index\nContinuity Rules for the Standard Index. In\norder to achieve index continuity as well as\nprovide some basic level of diversification\nwithin a market index, notwithstanding the\neffect of other index construction rules\ncontained herein, a minimum number of five\nconstituents will be maintained for a\ndeveloped market Standard Index and a minimum\nnumber of three constituents will be\nmaintained for an emerging market Standard\nIndex. Weighting. All indexes of the MSCI GIMI\nare free float weighted, i.e., companies are\nincluded in the indexes at the value of their\nfree public float (free float multiplied by\nsecurity price). Regional Weights. Market\ncapitalization-weighting, combined with a\nconsistent target of approximately 99% of free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization, helps\nensure that each country's weight in regional\nand international indexes approximates its\nweight in the total universe of developing and\nemerging markets. A market is equivalent to a\nsingle country except for developed Europe,\nwhere all markets are aggregated into a single\nmarket for index construction purposes.\nIndividual country indexes of the European\ndeveloped markets are derived from the\nconstituents of the MSCI GIMI Europe Index.\nFree Float. MSCI defines the free float of a\nsecurity as the proportion of shares\noutstanding that are deemed to be available\nfor purchase in the public equity markets by\ninternational investors. In practice,\nlimitations on free float available to\ninternational investors include: (i) strategic\nand other shareholdings not considered part of\navailable free float; and (ii) limits on share\nownership for foreigners. MSCI calculates the\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization of\neach security in the equity index universe by\n(i) defining and estimating the free float\navailable to foreign investors; (ii) assigning\na free float-adjustment factor to each\nsecurity; and (iii) calculating the free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of each\nsecurity. Under MSCI's free float-adjustment\nmethodology, a constituent's inclusion factor\nis equal to its estimated free float, rounded\nup to the closest 5% for constituents with\nfree float equal to or exceeding 15%. For\nexample, a constituent security with a free\nfloat of 23.2% will be included in the index\nat 25% of its market capitalization. For\nsecurities with a free float of less than 15%,\nthe estimated free float is adjusted to the\nnearest 1%. Price and Exchange Rates Prices.\nThe prices used to calculate all MSCI indexes\nare the official exchange closing prices or\nthose figures accepted as such. MSCI reserves\nthe right to use an alternative pricing source\non any given day. Exchange Rates. MSCI uses\nthe World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates\ntaken at 4:00 p.m. London time. In case World\nMarkets/Reuters does not provide rates for\nspecific markets on given days (for example,\nChristmas Day and New Year's Day), the\nprevious business day's rates are normally\nused. MSCI independently monitors the exchange\nrates on all its indexes. MSCI may under\nexceptional circumstances elect to use\nalternative sources of exchange rates if the\nWorld Markets/Reuters rates are not available,\nor if MSCI determines that the World\nMarkets/Reuters rates are not reflective of\nmarket circumstances for a given currency on a\nparticular day. In such circumstances, an\nannouncement would be sent to clients with the\nrelated information. If appropriate, MSCI may\nconduct a consultation with the investment\ncommunity to gather feedback on the most\nrelevant exchange rate. Changes to the\nIndexes. The MSCI GIMI are maintained with the\nobjective of reflecting, on a timely basis,\nthe evolution of the underlying equity\nmarkets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes,\nemphasis is also placed on continuity,\nreplicability and minimizing turnover in the\nindexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves\nmany aspects, including: (i) additions to, and\ndeletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in\nnumber of shares; and (iii) changes in\ninclusion factors as a result of updated free\nfloat estimates. Index maintenance can be\ndescribed by three broad categories of\nchanges:\n\n30\n\n\u2022 Semi-Annual Index Reviews ( \u201c SAIRs \u201d ),\nconducted on a fixed semi-annual timetable\nthat systematically reassess the various\ndimensions of the equity universe for all\nmarkets; \u2022 Quarterly Index Reviews ( \u201c QIRs \u201d\n), aimed at promptly reflecting other\nsignificant market events; and \u2022 Ongoing\nevent-related changes, such as mergers,\nacquisitions, spin-offs, bankruptcies,\nreorganizations and other similar corporate\nevents, which generally are implemented in the\nindexes as they occur. Potential changes in\nthe status of countries (stand-alone,\nfrontier, emerging and developed) follow their\nown implementation time tables. MSCI conducts\nSAIRs generally as of the close of the last\nbusiness day of May and November. During the\nSAIRs, MSCI updates the investable equity\nuniverse and reassesses size segmentation\ninvestability requirements. MSCI also conducts\nQIRs generally as of the close of the last\nbusiness day of February and August. During\nthe QIRs, MSCI reflects changes in the index\nthat were not captured at the time of their\nactual occurrence, but are significant enough\nto be included before the next SAIR. The\nresults of the SAIR and QIR are generally\nannounced at least ten business days in\nadvance of implementation. Creation of Sector\nand Industry Indexes using the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) All\nsecurities in the Global Investable Equity\nUniverse are assigned to the industry that\nbest describes their business activities using\nthe GICS. The GICS consists of sectors,\nindustry groups, industries and sub-\nindustries. Under the GICS, each company is\nassigned to one unique sub-industry according\nto its principal business activity (generally\ndefined as the business activity that\ngenerates 60% or more of the company\u2019s\nrevenues). Narrower indexes may be derived\nbased on industry classification, and may\ncontain securities belonging to specific\nsectors, industry groups, industries, sub-\nindustries or a combination thereof. MSCI\nEmerging Markets Value Factor Select Index\nNumber of Components: approximately 304 Index\nDescription. The MSCI Emerging Markets Value\nFactor Select Index seeks to measure the\nperformance of securities in its parent index,\nthe MSCI Emerging Markets Index, that exhibit\nhigher value factor characteristics relative\nto their peers within the corresponding GICS\nsector, while covering approximately 30% of\nthe market capitalization within each country\nin the parent index, and within the selected\nuniverse of value securities, an emphasis is\nput on those securities with relatively higher\nquality characteristics. Index Methodology .\nThe Underlying Index includes securities that\nare chosen from constituents within the parent\nindex. The Underlying Index aims to capture\nthe performance of securities in the parent\nindex that exhibit higher value\ncharacteristics based on one to three\nvariables depending on the GICS sector: Price-\nto-book value ( \u201c P/B \u201d ): Latest price per\nshare divided by the trailing 12-month book\nvalue per share. Price-to-forward earnings ( \u201c\nP/E \u201d ): Latest price per share divided by the\ntrailing 12-month forward earnings per share.\nEnterprise value-to-cash flow from operations\n( \u201c EV/CFO \u201d ): Latest fiscal year enterprise\nvalue divided by net cash flow from\noperations. Fwd P/E, P/B, EV/CFO are used for\nall securities except those classified in\nfinancials and real estate GICS sectors.\nSecurities in the financials sector use Fwd\nP/E and P/B, and securities in the real estate\nsector use EV/CFO. The methodology calculates\na \u201c value score \u201d for each security in the\nparent index by averaging the calculated\nz-scores of the three fundamental variables\nabove. A sector relative value score is then\nderived by standardizing the composite value\nz-scores within each GICS sector. The sector-\nrelative value scores are then standardized at\n+/- 3 standard deviations. If a value score is\nnot calculated due to the unavailability of\ncertain fundamental variables as described in\nthe methodology, the value score is set at -3.\nSecurities are then included based on their\nvalue score ranking (from highest ranking\nuntil lowest) until the securities cover 30%\nof the market capitalization (calculated using\nthe free float-adjusted market capitalization)\nwithin each country in the parent index\nsubject to certain additional constraints. The\nweight of each constituent is then determined\nby multiplying each security\u2019s market\ncapitalization weight in the parent index by a\n\u201c tilt score \u201d . The tilt score is based on\n(i) a \u201c value coverage score, \u201d calculated as\nthe corresponding cumulative weight within the\nparent index when sorted by the value score in\ndescending order, (ii) a \u201c quality coverage\nscore, \u201d calculated as the corresponding\ncumulative weight within the top 30% of the\nvalue universe when sorted by the highest \u201c\nquality score \u201d\n\n31\n\n(as described below), and (iii) relative\nposition based on market capitalization. The\nresulting weights are then normalized so that\ncomponent weights in the Underlying Index sum\nto 100%. Additionally, each individual issuer\nis capped at 5% and other constraints, such as\ncountry and sector weight limits relative to\nthe parent index, are applied. The Underlying\nIndex is reviewed and rebalanced on a semi-\nannual basis. A buffer rule and turnover\nthreshold are also applied to reduce index\nturnover and enhance index stability. The\nmethodology calculates a \u201c quality score \u201d for\neach security in the parent index by averaging\nthe calculated z-scores of the three\nfundamental variables described below (high\nreturn on equity, stable year-over-year\nearnings growth and low financial leverage). A\nsector relative quality score is then derived\nby standardizing the composite quality\nz-scores within each GICS sector. The sector-\nrelative quality scores are then standardized\nat +/- 3 standard deviations. If a quality\nscore is not calculated due to the\nunavailability of certain fundamental\nvariables as described in the methodology, the\nquality score is set at -3. High return on\nequity: Based on trailing 12-month earnings\nper share divided by the latest book value per\nshare. Stable year-over-year earnings growth:\nBased on standard deviation of year-over-year\nearnings per share growth over last five\nfiscal years. Low financial leverage: Based on\nlatest fiscal year total debt-to-book value.\nCalculation Methodology . The Fund utilizes\nthe Underlying Index calculated with net\ndividends reinvested. MSCI uses the index\nconstituent companies\u2019 country of\nincorporation to determine the relevant\ndividend withholding tax rates in calculating\nthe net dividends. The regular cash dividend\nis reinvested after deduction of withholding\ntax by applying the maximum rate of the\ncompany\u2019s country of incorporation applicable\nto institutional investors. Net dividends\nmeans dividends after taxes withheld at the\nrate applicable to non-resident institutional\ninvestors who do not benefit from double\ntaxation treaties. Such withholding rates may\ndiffer from those applicable to U.S.\nresidents. Investment Policies The Board has\nadopted as fundamental policies the following\nnumbered investment policies, which cannot be\nchanged without the approval of the holders of\na majority of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. A vote of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund is\ndefined in the Investment Company Act as the\nlesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities present at a shareholder meeting,\nif the holders of more than 50% of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (ii) more\nthan 50% of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund. The Fund has also adopted certain\nnon-fundamental investment policies, including\nits investment objective. Non-fundamental\ninvestment policies may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval. Therefore,\nthe Fund may change its investment objective\nand its Underlying Index without shareholder\napproval. Fundamental Investment Policies The\nFund may not: 1. Concentrate its investments\nin a particular industry, as that term is used\nin the Investment Company Act, except that the\nFund will concentrate to approximately the\nsame extent that its Underlying Index\nconcentrates in the securities of a particular\nindustry or group of industries. 2. Borrow\nmoney, except as permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act. 3. Issue senior\nsecurities to the extent such issuance would\nviolate the Investment Company Act. 4.\nPurchase or hold real estate, except the Fund\nmay purchase and hold securities or other\ninstruments that are secured by, or linked to,\nreal estate or interests therein, securities\nof REITs, mortgage-related securities and\nsecurities of issuers engaged in the real\nestate business, and the Fund may purchase and\nhold real estate as a result of the ownership\nof securities or other instruments. 5.\nUnderwrite securities issued by others, except\nto the extent that the sale of portfolio\nsecurities by the Fund may be deemed to be an\nunderwriting or as otherwise permitted by\napplicable law. 6. Purchase or sell\ncommodities or commodity contracts, except as\npermitted by the Investment Company Act. 7.\nMake loans to the extent prohibited by the\nInvestment Company Act. Notations Regarding\nthe Fund's Fundamental Investment Policies\n\n32\n\nThe following notations are not considered to\nbe part of the Fund\u2019s fundamental investment\npolicies and are subject to change without\nshareholder approval. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to concentration\nset forth in (1) above, the Investment Company\nAct does not define what constitutes \u201c\nconcentration \u201d in an industry. The SEC staff\nhas taken the position that investment of 25%\nor more of a fund\u2019s total assets in one or\nmore issuers conducting their principal\nactivities in the same industry or group of\nindustries constitutes concentration. It is\npossible that interpretations of concentration\ncould change in the future. The policy in (1)\nabove will be interpreted to refer to\nconcentration as that term may be interpreted\nfrom time to time. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to permit investment without limit\nin the following: securities of the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; securities of state,\nterritory, possession or municipal governments\nand their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\nthe Fund's industry classifications, the Fund\ncurrently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to the\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits the Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund's total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires the Fund to maintain at all times\nan \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300% of the\namount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means\nthe ratio that the value of the Fund's total\nassets (including amounts borrowed), minus\nliabilities other than borrowings, bears to\nthe aggregate amount of all borrowings.\nBorrowing money to increase portfolio holdings\nis known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d Certain trading\npractices and investments, such as reverse\nrepurchase agreements, may be considered to be\nborrowings or involve leverage and thus are\nsubject to the Investment Company Act\nrestrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4\nunder the Investment Company Act, when the\nFund engages in reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions, the Fund\nmay either (i) maintain asset coverage of at\nleast 300% with respect to such transactions\nand any other borrowings in the aggregate, or\n(ii) treat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of a fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the business of underwriting, the\npolicy in (5) above will be interpreted not to\nprevent a fund from engaging in transactions\ninvolving the acquisition or disposition of\nportfolio securities, regardless of whether a\nfund may be considered to be an underwriter\nunder the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in\nthe underwriting business to the extent\npermitted by applicable law. With respect to\nthe fundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit the Fund from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies\n\n33\n\nThe Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy\nnot to make short sales of securities or\nmaintain a short position, except to the\nextent permitted by the Fund's Prospectus and\nSAI, as amended from time to time, and\napplicable law. The Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental investment policy in accordance\nwith Rule 35d-1 under the Investment Company\nAct to invest, under normal circumstances, at\nleast 80% of the value of its net assets, plus\nthe amount of any borrowings for investment\npurposes, in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index or in depositary receipts\nrepresenting component securities in its\nUnderlying Index. The Fund also has adopted a\npolicy to provide its shareholders with at\nleast 60 days\u2019 prior written notice of any\nchange in such policy. If, subsequent to an\ninvestment, the 80% requirement is no longer\nmet, the Fund\u2019s future investments will be\nmade in a manner that will bring the Fund into\ncompliance with this policy. The Fund has\nadopted a non-fundamental policy not to\npurchase securities of other investment\ncompanies, except to the extent permitted by\nthe Investment Company Act. As a matter of\npolicy, however, the Fund will not purchase\nshares of any registered open-end investment\ncompany or registered unit investment trust,\nin reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the\n\u201c fund of funds \u201d provisions) of the\nInvestment Company Act, at any time the Fund\nhas knowledge that its shares are purchased by\nanother investment company investor in\nreliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G)\nof Section 12(d)(1). Unless otherwise\nindicated, all limitations under the Fund's\nfundamental or non-fundamental investment\npolicies apply only at the time that a\ntransaction is undertaken. Any change in the\npercentage of the Fund's assets invested in\ncertain securities or other instruments\nresulting from market fluctuations or other\nchanges in the Fund\u2019s total assets will not\nrequire the Fund to dispose of an investment\nuntil BFA determines that it is practicable to\nsell or close out the investment without undue\nmarket or tax consequences. Continuous\nOffering The method by which Creation Units\nare created and traded may raise certain\nissues under applicable securities laws.\nBecause new Creation Units are issued and sold\nby the Fund on an ongoing basis, at any point\na \u201c distribution, \u201d as such term is used in\nthe 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nthat could render them statutory underwriters\nand subject them to the prospectus delivery\nrequirement and liability provisions of the\n1933 Act. For example, a broker-dealer firm or\nits client may be deemed a statutory\nunderwriter if it takes Creation Units after\nplacing an order with the Distributor, breaks\nthem down into constituent shares and sells\nsuch shares directly to customers or if it\nchooses to couple the creation of new shares\nwith an active selling effort involving\nsolicitation of secondary market demand for\nshares. A determination of whether one is an\nunderwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must\ntake into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an underwriter.\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\neffecting transactions in shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nshares, generally are required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\n1933 Act is not available in respect of such\ntransactions as a result of Section 24(d) of\nthe 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus\ndelivery obligation with respect to shares of\nthe Fund are reminded that, pursuant to Rule\n153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery\nobligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933\nAct owed to an exchange member in connection\nwith a sale on the Listing Exchange generally\nis satisfied by the fact that the prospectus\nis available at the Listing Exchange upon\nrequest. The prospectus delivery mechanism\nprovided in Rule 153 is available only with\nrespect to transactions on an exchange.\nManagement Trustees and Officers. The Board\nhas responsibility for the overall management\nand operations of the Fund, including general\nsupervision of the duties performed by BFA and\nother service providers. Each Trustee serves\nuntil he or she resigns, is removed, dies,\nretires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer\nshall hold office until his or her successor\nis elected and qualifies or until his or her\ndeath, resignation or removal. Trustees who\nare not \u201c interested persons \u201d (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the Trust are referred to as\nindependent trustees ( \u201c Independent Trustees\n\u201d ).\n\n34\n\nThe registered investment companies advised by\nBFA or its affiliates (the \u201c BlackRock-advised\nFunds \u201d ) are organized into one complex of\nopen-end equity, multi-asset, index and money\nmarket funds and ETFs (the \u201c BlackRock Multi-\nAsset Complex \u201d ), one complex of closed-end\nfunds and open-end non-index fixed-income\nfunds (including ETFs) (the \u201c BlackRock Fixed-\nIncome Complex \u201d ) and one complex of ETFs ( \u201c\nExchange-Traded Fund Complex \u201d ) (each, a \u201c\nBlackRock Fund Complex \u201d ). The Fund is\nincluded in the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex.\nEach Trustee also serves as a Director of\niShares, Inc. and a Trustee of iShares U.S.\nETF Trust and, as a result, oversees all of\nthe funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund\nComplex, which consists of 406 funds as of\nDecember 4, 2023. With the exception of Robert\nS. Kapito, Salim Ramji, Dominik Roh\u00e9 and Aaron\nWasserman, the address of each Trustee and\nofficer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address\nof Mr. Kapito, Mr. Ramji, Mr. Roh\u00e9 and Mr.\nWasserman is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson\nYards, New York, NY 10001. The Board has\ndesignated John E. Kerrigan as its Independent\nBoard Chair.

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Fund rests\nwith the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to\nmanage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The\nBoard is responsible for overseeing BFA and\nother service providers in the operations of\nthe Fund in accordance with the provisions of\nthe 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state\nand other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The\nBoard is currently composed of eleven members,\nnine of whom are Independent Trustees. The\nBoard currently conducts regular in person\nmeetings four times a year. In addition, the\nBoard frequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The Independent Trustees meet\nregularly outside the presence of management,\nin executive session or with other service\nproviders to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Fund, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Fund with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the oversight functions delegated to\nthe Committee by the Board and reports its\nfinding to the Board. The Board and each\nstanding Committee conduct annual assessments\nof their oversight function and structure. The\nBoard has determined that the Board\u2019s\nleadership structure is appropriate because it\nallows the Board to exercise independent\njudgment over management and it allocates\nareas of responsibility among committees of\nIndependent Trustees and the full Board to\nenhance effective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Fund is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. The\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Fund. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of the\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Fund. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by the Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting the Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Fund's\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support the Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight\n\n42\n\nresponsibilities. From time to time, the Board\nmay modify the manner in which it conducts\nrisk oversight. The Board\u2019s oversight role\ndoes not make it a guarantor of the Fund's\ninvestment performance or other activities.\nCommittees of the Board of Trustees.

Control\nPersons and Principal Holders of Securities.\nOwnership information is not provided for the\nFund, as it has not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI. Conflicts of Interest.\nCertain activities of BFA, BlackRock, Inc. and\nthe other subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc.\n(collectively referred to in this section as \u201c\nBlackRock \u201d ) and their respective directors,\nofficers and employees, with respect to the\nFund and/or other accounts managed by\nBlackRock, may give rise to actual or\nperceived conflicts of interest such as those\ndescribed below. BlackRock is one of the\nworld's largest asset management firms.\nBlackRock, its subsidiaries and their\nrespective directors, officers and employees,\nincluding the business units or entities and\npersonnel who may be involved in the\ninvestment activities and business operations\nof the Fund, are engaged worldwide in\nbusinesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Fund. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by the Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of the\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's\n\n48\n\nperformance. Such transactions, particularly\nin respect of most proprietary accounts or\nclient accounts, will be executed\nindependently of the Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFund. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell\nthe same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding the Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor the Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of the\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding\nthe Fund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for the Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause the Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so. Conflicts may also\narise because portfolio decisions regarding\nthe Fund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby the Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and\nthe purchase of a security or covering of a\nshort position in a security by the Fund may\nincrease the price of the same security held\nby (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its\nother accounts or funds. In addition, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, the Fund\nmay invest its assets in other funds advised\nby BlackRock, including funds that are managed\nby one or more of the same portfolio managers,\nwhich could result in conflicts of interest\nrelating to asset allocation, timing of Fund\npurchases and sales, and increased\nremuneration and profitability for BlackRock,\nand/or its personnel, including portfolio\nmanagers. In certain circumstances, BlackRock,\non behalf of the Fund, may seek to buy from or\nsell securities to another fund or account\nadvised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is\nnot required to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Fund, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Fund. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when the\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which the Fund\nhas invested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of\nthe Fund's investments may be negatively\nimpacted by the activities of BlackRock or its\nclients, and transactions for the Fund may be\nimpaired or effected at prices or terms that\nmay be less favorable than would otherwise\nhave been the case. The results of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities may differ significantly\nfrom the results achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by the\nFund. Moreover, it is possible that the Fund\nwill sustain losses during periods in which\none or more proprietary or other accounts\nmanaged or advised by BlackRock achieve\nsignificant profits. The opposite result is\nalso possible. From time to time, the Fund may\nbe restricted from purchasing or selling\nsecurities, or from engaging in other\ninvestment activities because of regulatory,\nlegal or contractual requirements applicable\nto BlackRock or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock, and/or the internal\npolicies of BlackRock designed to comply with\nsuch requirements. As a result, there may be\nperiods, for example, when BlackRock will not\ninitiate or recommend certain types of\ntransactions in certain securities or\ninstruments with respect to which BlackRock is\nperforming services or when position limits\nhave been reached. For example, the investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and accounts under its management may\n\n49\n\nlimit the investment opportunities for the\nFund in certain emerging and other markets in\nwhich limitations are imposed upon the amount\nof investment, in the aggregate or in\nindividual issuers, by affiliated foreign\ninvestors. In connection with its management\nof the Fund, BlackRock may have access to\ncertain fundamental analysis and proprietary\ntechnical models developed by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will not be under any obligation,\nhowever, to effect transactions on behalf of\nthe Fund in accordance with such analysis and\nmodels. In addition, BlackRock will not have\nany obligation to make available any\ninformation regarding its proprietary\nactivities or strategies, or the activities or\nstrategies used for other accounts managed by\nthem, for the benefit of the management of the\nFund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock\nwill have access to such information for the\npurpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary\nactivities or portfolio strategies of\nBlackRock, or the activities or strategies\nused for accounts managed by BlackRock or\nother client accounts could conflict with the\ntransactions and strategies employed by\nBlackRock in managing the Fund. The Fund may\nbe included in investment models developed by\nBlackRock for use by clients and financial\nadvisors. To the extent clients invest in\nthese investment models and increase the\nassets under management of the Fund, the\ninvestment management fee amounts paid by the\nFund to BlackRock may also increase. The\nprice, availability and liquidity of the Fund\nmay be impacted by purchases and sales of the\nFund by model-driven investment portfolios, as\nwell as by BlackRock itself and by its\nadvisory clients. In addition, certain\nprincipals and certain employees of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment adviser are also principals or\nemployees of other business units or entities\nwithin BlackRock. As a result, these\nprincipals and employees may have obligations\nto such other business units or entities or\ntheir clients and such obligations to other\nbusiness units or entities or their clients\nmay be a consideration of which investors in\nthe Fund should be aware. BlackRock may enter\ninto transactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of the\nFund in which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by the Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which the Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non the Fund could potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthe Fund and increased assets under management\nfor BlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Fund or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may from\ntime to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. The Fund may,\nsubject to applicable law, purchase\ninvestments that are the subject of an\nunderwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse to those\nof the Fund. At times, these activities may\ncause business units or entities within\nBlackRock to give advice to clients that may\ncause these clients to take actions adverse to\nthe interests of the Fund. To the extent such\ntransactions are permitted, the Fund will deal\nwith BlackRock on an arm\u2019s-length basis. To\nthe extent authorized by applicable law,\nBlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent,\nlender or adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund. It is anticipated\nthat the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs,\nfinancial advisory fees, underwriting and\nplacement fees, sales fees, financing and\ncommitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees,\ncompensation or\n\n50\n\nprofits, rates, terms and conditions charged\nby BlackRock will be in its view commercially\nreasonable, although BlackRock, including its\nsales personnel, will have an interest in\nobtaining fees and other amounts that are\nfavorable to BlackRock and such sales\npersonnel, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund. Index based funds may use an index\nprovider that is affiliated with another\nservice provider of the Fund or BlackRock that\nacts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in\nother commercial capacities for the Fund or\nBlackRock. Subject to applicable law,\nBlackRock (and its personnel and other\ndistributors) will be entitled to retain fees\nand other amounts that they receive in\nconnection with their service to the Fund as\nbroker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in\nother commercial capacities. No accounting to\nthe Fund or its shareholders will be required,\nand no fees or other compensation payable by\nthe Fund or its shareholders will be reduced\nby reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such\nfees or other amounts. When BlackRock acts as\nbroker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other\ncommercial capacities in relation to the Fund,\nBlackRock may take commercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund. The Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund's own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with the Fund's establishment of\nits business relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund's counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund's creditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFund. BlackRock will also receive compensation\nfor managing the reinvestment of the cash\ncollateral from securities lending. There are\npotential conflicts of interests in managing a\nsecurities lending program, including but not\nlimited to: (i) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to, among\nother things, increase or decrease the amount\nof securities on loan or to lend particular\nsecurities in order to generate additional\nrisk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its\naffiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to\nallocate loans to clients that would provide\nmore revenue to BlackRock. As described\nfurther below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate\nthis conflict by providing its securities\nlending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Fund and certain other clients\nand/or funds against a shortfall in collateral\nin the event of borrower default. On a regular\nbasis, BlackRock calculates the potential\ndollar exposure of collateral shortfall\nresulting from a borrower default ( \u201c\nshortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e., indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a loan opportunity arrives; and\n(iii) the lending portfolio must also have\nenough inventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. BlackRock may decline to\nmake a securities loan on behalf of the Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of the Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of the\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for the Fund may\nbe bunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio\n\n51\n\nmanagement decisions for different accounts\nare made separately, or if they determine that\nbunching or aggregating is not practicable or\nrequired, or in cases involving client\ndirection. Prevailing trading activity\nfrequently may make impossible the receipt of\nthe same price or execution on the entire\nvolume of securities purchased or sold. When\nthis occurs, the various prices may be\naveraged, and the Fund will be charged or\ncredited with the average price. Thus, the\neffect of the aggregation may operate on some\noccasions to the disadvantage of the Fund. In\naddition, under certain circumstances, the\nFund will not be charged the same commission\nor commission equivalent rates in connection\nwith a bunched or aggregated order. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock may select brokers\nthat furnish BlackRock, the Fund, other\nBlackRock client accounts or personnel,\ndirectly or through correspondent\nrelationships, with research or other\nappropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Fund and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the Fund\nbased on the amount of brokerage commissions\npaid by the Fund and such other BlackRock\nclient accounts. For example, research or\nother services that are paid for through one\nclient's commissions may not be used in\nmanaging that client's account. In addition,\nother BlackRock client accounts may receive\nthe benefit, including disproportionate\nbenefits, of economies of scale or price\ndiscounts in connection with products and\nservices that may be provided to the Fund and\nto such other BlackRock client accounts. To\nthe extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars,\nit will not have to pay for those products and\nservices itself. BlackRock does not currently\nenter into arrangements to use the Fund's\nassets for, or participate in, soft dollars,\nalthough BlackRock may receive research that\nis bundled with the trade execution, clearing,\nand/or settlement services provided by a\nparticular broker-dealer. To the extent that\nBlackRock receives research on this basis,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. For\nexample, the research effectively will be paid\nby client commissions that also will be used\nto pay for the execution, clearing, and\nsettlement services provided by the broker-\ndealer and will not be paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable\nlaw, may endeavor to execute trades through\nbrokers who, pursuant to such arrangements,\nprovide research or other services in order to\nensure the continued receipt of research or\nother services BlackRock believes are useful\nin its investment decision-making process.\nBlackRock may from time to time choose not to\nengage in the above described arrangements to\nvarying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited\nby applicable law, may also enter into\ncommission sharing arrangements under which\nBlackRock may execute transactions through a\nbroker-dealer, and request that the broker-\ndealer allocate a portion of the commissions\nor commission credits to another firm that\nprovides research to BlackRock. To the extent\nthat BlackRock engages in commission sharing\narrangements, many of the same conflicts\nrelated to traditional soft dollars may exist.\nBlackRock may utilize certain electronic\ncrossing networks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including,\nwithout limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock\nhas an investment or other interest, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law) in\nexecuting client securities transactions for\ncertain types of securities. These ECNs may\ncharge fees for their services, including\naccess fees and transaction fees. The\ntransaction fees, which are similar to\ncommissions or markups/markdowns, will\ngenerally be charged to clients and, like\ncommissions and markups/markdowns, would\ngenerally be included in the cost of the\nsecurities purchased. Access fees may be paid\nby BlackRock even though incurred in\nconnection with executing transactions on\nbehalf of clients, including the Fund. In\ncertain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume\ndiscounts that will reduce the access fees\ntypically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nonly utilize ECNs consistent with its\nobligation to seek to obtain best execution in\nclient transactions. BlackRock owns a minority\ninterest in, and is a member of, Members\nExchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly created U.S.\nstock exchange. Transactions for the Fund may\nbe executed on MEMX if third party brokers\nselect MEMX as the appropriate venue for\nexecution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of such Funds. In addition,\ntransactions in Fund shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the\nappropriate venue for the execution of such\norders. BlackRock has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent conflicts of\ninterest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Fund, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock's fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\n\n52\n\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee the Proxy Voting Policy section of this\nSAI. It is also possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of\nthe Fund. Increasing the Fund\u2019s assets may\nenhance liquidity, investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the\nright, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw, to sell into the market or redeem in\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of the Fund acquired for its own\naccounts or the account of a BlackRock\nadvisory client. A large sale or redemption of\nshares of the Fund by BlackRock itself or a\nBlackRock advisory client could significantly\nreduce the asset size of the Fund, which might\nhave an adverse effect on the Fund's\nliquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio\ndiversification, expense ratio or ability to\ncomply with the listing requirements for the\nFund. It is possible that the Fund may invest\nin securities of, or engage in transactions\nwith, companies in which BlackRock has\nsignificant debt or equity investments or\nother interests. The Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured notes) by\nentities for which BlackRock provides and is\ncompensated for cash management services\nrelating to the proceeds from the sale of such\nissuances. In making investment decisions for\nthe Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain\nor use material non-public information\nacquired by any unit of BlackRock in the\ncourse of these activities. In addition, from\ntime to time, the activities of BlackRock may\nlimit the Fund's flexibility in purchases and\nsales of securities. As indicated below,\nBlackRock may engage in transactions with\ncompanies in which BlackRock-advised funds or\nother clients of BlackRock have an investment.\nBlackRock, its personnel and other financial\nservice providers may have interests in\npromoting sales of the Fund. With respect to\nBlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration\nand profitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Fund or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFund or its shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFund may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or the Fund, may\nsponsor events (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to the Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients'\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\nthe Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other data sources unavailable to the\nFund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will\ngenerally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to the Fund's\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund's pricing\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan the valuation for such security or\ninvestment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock. As disclosed in more detail in the\nDetermination of Net Asset Value section in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value by BFA. BFA has been designated\nas the Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBFA pricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that the Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be\n\n53\n\nbased on analytical values determined by BFA\nusing proprietary or third-party valuation\nmodels, fair value represents only a good\nfaith approximation of the value of an asset\nor liability. The fair value of one or more\nassets or liabilities may not, in retrospect,\nbe the price at which those assets or\nliabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, the Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, the Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in the Fund\nbearing some additional expenses. BlackRock\nand its directors, officers and employees, may\nbuy and sell securities or other investments\nfor their own accounts and may have conflicts\nof interest with respect to investments made\non behalf of the Fund. As a result of\ndiffering trading and investment strategies or\nconstraints, positions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees that are the\nsame, different from or made at different\ntimes than positions taken for the Fund. To\nlessen the possibility that the Fund will be\nadversely affected by this personal trading,\nthe Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted\na code of ethics in compliance with Section\n17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts\nsecurities trading in the personal accounts of\ninvestment professionals and others who\nnormally come into possession of information\nregarding the Fund's portfolio transactions.\nEach code of ethics is available by contacting\nBlackRock at the telephone number on the back\ncover of the Fund\u2019s Prospectus or by accessing\nthe EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site\nat http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\nthe Fund, except that the Fund may in\naccordance with rules or guidance adopted\nunder the 1940 Act engage in transactions with\nanother Fund or accounts that are affiliated\nwith the Fund as a result of common officers,\ndirectors, or investment advisers or pursuant\nto exemptive orders granted to the Fund and/or\nBlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would\nbe effected in circumstances in which\nBlackRock determined that it would be\nappropriate for the Fund to purchase and\nanother client of BlackRock to sell, or the\nFund to sell and another client of BlackRock\nto purchase, the same security or instrument\non the same day. From time to time, the\nactivities of the Fund may be restricted\nbecause of regulatory requirements applicable\nto BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal\npolicies designed to comply with, limit the\napplicability of, or otherwise relate to such\nrequirements. A client not advised by\nBlackRock would not be subject to some of\nthose considerations. There may be periods\nwhen BlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of the Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which the Fund wishes to\npurchase or sell. However, if permitted by\napplicable law, and where consistent with\nBlackRock\u2019s policies and procedures (including\nthe necessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Fund may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Fund. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Fund invests in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or is\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invests in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Fund) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Fund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or the Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Fund), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As\n\n54\n\na result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients\n(including the Fund), may limit purchases,\nsell existing investments, or otherwise\nrestrict, forgo or limit the exercise of\nrights (including transferring, outsourcing or\nlimiting voting rights or forgoing the right\nto receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its\nsole discretion, deems it appropriate in light\nof potential regulatory or other restrictions\non ownership or other consequences resulting\nfrom reaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Fund),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations. In addition to the\nforegoing, other ownership thresholds may\ntrigger reporting requirements to governmental\nand regulatory authorities, and such reports\nmay entail the disclosure of the identity of a\nclient or BlackRock\u2019s intended strategy with\nrespect to such security or asset. BlackRock\nmay not serve as an Authorized Participant in\nthe creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.\nBlackRock may maintain securities indices. To\nthe extent permitted by applicable laws, the\nFund may seek to license and use such indices\nas part of its investment strategy. Index\nbased funds that seek to track the performance\nof securities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Fund using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to the\nFund and the Fund is under no obligation to\nuse BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters\ninto a license for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to the Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to the\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Fund,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to the Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to the Fund, or the\nselection of such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by the Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Fund, that engage the\nservice provider (typically the custodian).\nThe Fund\u2019s service provider remunerates\nBlackRock for the use of the systems. The Fund\nservice provider\u2019s payments to BlackRock for\nthe use of these systems may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock.\n\n55\n\nBlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a service\nprovider in connection with the use of systems\nprovided by BlackRock may create an incentive\nfor BlackRock to recommend that the Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider. In recognition of a BlackRock\nclient\u2019s overall relationship with BlackRock,\nBlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in the Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock (including BFA), its\ndirectors, officers and employees, in addition\nto those described in this section, may give\nrise to additional conflicts of interest.\nInvestment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services Investment Adviser. BFA\nserves as investment adviser to the Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, and\nBFA. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is\nregistered as an investment adviser under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nUnder the investment advisory agreement, BFA,\nsubject to the supervision of the Board and in\nconformity with the stated investment policies\nof the Fund, manages and administers the Trust\nand the investment of the Fund\u2019s assets. BFA\nis responsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the investment advisory agreement, BFA may,\nfrom time to time, in its sole discretion and\nto the extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to the Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. BFA is\nresponsible, under the investment advisory\nagreement, for substantially all expenses of\nthe Fund, including the cost of transfer\nagency, custody, fund administration, legal,\naudit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Fund will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees).BFA may from time to time\nvoluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary\nwaiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by\nBFA at any time. For its investment advisory\nservices to the Fund, BFA is paid a management\nfee by the Fund, based on a percentage of the\nFund\u2019s average daily net assets, at an annual\nrate of 0.35%. The investment advisory\nagreement with respect to the Fund continues\nin effect for two years from its effective\ndate, and thereafter is subject to annual\napproval by (i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of\na majority of the outstanding voting\nsecurities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, provided that in either event such\ncontinuance also is approved by a majority of\nthe Board members who are not interested\npersons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund, by a vote cast in person at a meeting\ncalled for the purpose of voting on such\napproval. The investment advisory agreement\nwith respect to the Fund is terminable without\npenalty, on 60 days\u2019 notice, by the Board or\nby a vote of the holders of a majority of the\nFund\u2019s outstanding voting securities (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act). The investment\nadvisory agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays\u2019 notice by BFA and will terminate\nautomatically in the event of its assignment\n(as defined in the 1940 Act). Portfolio\nManagers. As of August 31, 2023, the\nindividuals named as Portfolio Managers in the\nFund's Prospectus were also primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nother iShares funds and certain other types of\nportfolios and/or accounts as follows:\n\n56\n                                              \n  Jennifer Hsui                               \n  Types of         Number              Total  \n  Accounts                            Assets  \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          333  $2,020,183,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment            1      4,461,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts       19     34,143,000,000  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n  Types of         Number              Total  \n  Accounts                            Assets  \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          286  $1,906,774,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment           37      9,687,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts       54      4,289,000,000  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul Whitehead                              \n  Types of         Number              Total  \n  Accounts                            Assets  \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          341  $2,022,190,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment          337  1,014,501,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts      165    666,598,000,000  \n                                              \nPursuant to BFA\u2019s policy, investment\nopportunities are allocated equitably among\nthe Fund and other portfolios and accounts.\nFor example, under certain circumstances, an\ninvestment opportunity may be restricted due\nto limited supply in the market, legal\nconstraints or other factors, in which event\nthe investment opportunity will be allocated\nequitably among those portfolios and accounts,\nincluding the Fund, seeking such investment\nopportunity. As a consequence, from time to\ntime the Fund may receive a smaller allocation\nof an investment opportunity than it would\nhave if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its\naffiliates did not manage other portfolios or\naccounts. Like the Fund, the other portfolios\nor accounts for which the Portfolio Managers\nare primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management generally pay an asset-\nbased fee to BFA or its affiliates, as\napplicable, for its advisory services. One or\nmore of those other portfolios or accounts,\nhowever, may pay BFA or its affiliates a\nperformance-based fee in lieu of, or in\naddition to, an asset-based fee for its\nadvisory services. A portfolio or account with\na performance-based fee would pay BFA or its\naffiliates a portion of that portfolio\u2019s or\naccount\u2019s gains, or would pay BFA or its\naffiliates more for its services than would\notherwise be the case if BFA or any of its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Fund should be aware that,\nas with any group of portfolios and accounts\nmanaged by an investment adviser and/or its\naffiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below show, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of August 31, 2023:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n57\n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts        Performance   Total Assets  \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1  $2,396,000,0\u2026  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of December 4, 2023.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance. As of December 4, 2023,\nthe Portfolio Managers did not beneficially\nown shares of the Fund. Codes of Ethics. The\nTrust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted\ncodes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under\nthe 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit\npersonnel subject to the codes of ethics to\ninvest in securities, subject to certain\nlimitations, including securities that may be\npurchased or held by the Fund. Each code of\nethics is available by contacting BlackRock at\nthe telephone number on the back cover of the\nFund\u2019s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR\nDatabase on the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. Anti-Money\nLaundering Requirements. The Fund is subject\nto the USA PATRIOT Act (the \u201c Patriot Act \u201d ).\nThe Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use\nof the U.S. financial system in furtherance of\nmoney laundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Pursuant to requirements under the\nPatriot Act, the Fund may request information\nfrom Authorized Participants to enable it to\nform a reasonable belief that it knows the\ntrue identity of its Authorized Participants.\nThis information will be used to verify the\nidentity of Authorized Participants or, in\nsome cases, the status of financial\nprofessionals; it will be used only for\ncompliance with the requirements of the\nPatriot Act. The Fund reserves the right to\nreject purchase orders from persons who have\nnot submitted information sufficient to allow\nthe Fund to verify their identity. The Fund\nalso reserves the right to redeem any amounts\nin the Fund from persons whose identity it is\nunable to verify on a timely basis. It is the\nFund's policy to cooperate fully with\nappropriate regulators in any investigations\nconducted with respect to potential money\nlaundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities.\n\n58\n\nAdministrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent.\nState Street Bank and Trust Company ( \u201c State\nStreet \u201d ) serves as administrator, custodian\nand transfer agent for the Fund under the\nMaster Services Agreement and related Service\nSchedule (the \u201c Service Module \u201d ). State\nStreet\u2019s principal address is One Congress\nStreet, Suite 1, Boston, MA 02114-2016.\nPursuant to the Service Module for Fund\nAdministration and Accounting Services with\nthe Trust, State Street provides necessary\nadministrative, legal, tax and accounting and\nfinancial reporting services for the\nmaintenance and operations of the Trust and\nthe Fund. In addition, State Street makes\navailable the office space, equipment,\npersonnel and facilities required to provide\nsuch services. Pursuant to the Service Module\nfor Custodial Services with the Trust, State\nStreet maintains, in separate accounts, cash,\nsecurities and other assets of the Trust and\nthe Fund, keeps all necessary accounts and\nrecords and provides other services. State\nStreet is required, upon the order of the\nTrust, to deliver securities held by State\nStreet and to make payments for securities\npurchased by the Trust for the Fund. State\nStreet is authorized to appoint certain\nforeign custodians or foreign custody managers\nfor Fund investments outside the U.S. Pursuant\nto the Service Module for Transfer Agency\nServices with the Trust, State Street acts as\na transfer agent for the Fund\u2019s authorized and\nissued shares of beneficial interest, and as\ndividend disbursing agent of the Trust. As\ncompensation for these services, State Street\nreceives certain out-of-pocket costs,\ntransaction fees and asset-based fees which\nare accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA from\nits management fee. JPMorgan serves as\ncustodian for the Fund in connection with\ncertain securities lending activities under a\nCustody Services Agreement. JPMorgan\u2019s\nprincipal address is 383 Madison Avenue, 11 th\nFloor, New York, NY 10179. Pursuant to the\nCustody Services Agreement with BTC and the\nTrust, JPMorgan provides custody and related\nservices required to facilitate securities\nlending by the Fund. JPMorgan maintains\ncustody as may be necessary to facilitate Fund\nsecurities lending activity in coordination\nwith other funds, maintains custodial records\nand provides other services. As compensation\nfor these services, JPMorgan receives certain\nfees and expenses paid by BTC from its\ncompensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Distributor. The Distributor's\nprincipal address is 50 Hudson Yards, New\nYork, NY 10001. Shares are continuously\noffered for sale by the Fund through the\nDistributor or its agent only in Creation\nUnits, as described in the Prospectus and\nbelow in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI. Fund\nshares in amounts less than Creation Units are\ngenerally not distributed by the Distributor\nor its agent. The Distributor or its agent\nwill arrange for the delivery of the\nProspectus and, upon request, this SAI to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nor its agents and confirmations of acceptance\nfurnished by it or its agents. The Distributor\nis a broker-dealer registered under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.\n( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor is also\nlicensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S.\nstates, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands and the District of Columbia.\nThe Distribution Agreement for the Fund\nprovides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii)\nthe vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the Fund. The Distribution Agreement will\nterminate automatically in the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act). The\nDistributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers\n\u201d ) who will solicit purchases of Creation\nUnits of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers\nmay also be Authorized Participants (as\ndescribed below), Depository Trust Company ( \u201c\nDTC \u201d ) participants and/or investor services\norganizations. BFA or its affiliates may, from\ntime to time and from its own resources, pay,\ndefray or absorb costs relating to\ndistribution, including payments out of its\nown resources to the Distributor, or to\notherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that the\nFund engages in securities lending, the Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund, subject\nto the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to\na written agreement (the \u201c Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement \u201d ). The Fund retains a\nportion of the securities lending income and\nremits the remaining portion to BTC as\ncompensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Securities lending income is\ngenerally equal to the total of income earned\nfrom the reinvestment of cash collateral (and\nexcludes collateral investment fees as defined\nbelow), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. As securities\nlending agent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. The\nFund is responsible for fees in connection\nwith the investment of cash collateral\nreceived for securities on loan in a money\nmarket fund managed by BFA (the \u201c collateral\ninvestment fees \u201d ); however, BTC has agreed\nto reduce the amount of securities lending\nincome it receives in order to effectively\nlimit the collateral\n\n59\n\ninvestment fees the Fund bears to an annual\nrate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares\nwill not be subject to a sales load,\nredemption fee, distribution fee or service\nfee. Under the securities lending program, the\nFund is categorized into one of several\nspecific asset classes. The determination of\nthe Fund\u2019s asset class category (fixed-income,\ndomestic equity, international equity or fund-\nof-funds), each of which may be subject to a\ndifferent fee arrangement, is based on a\nmethodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.\nPursuant to the current Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement: (i) international equity\nfunds, such as the Fund, retain 82% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees), and (ii) this\namount can never be less than 70% of the sum\nof securities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees. In addition, commencing the\nbusiness day following the date that the\naggregate securities lending income (which\nincludes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex (as defined in the\nManagement \u2014 Trustees and Officers section of\nthis SAI) in a calendar year exceeds a\nspecified threshold, each applicable\ninternational equity fund, pursuant to the\ncurrent Securities Lending Agency Agreement,\nwill receive for the remainder of that\ncalendar year securities lending income as\nfollows: (i) 85% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees);\nand (ii) this amount can never be less than\n70% of the sum of securities lending income\nplus collateral investment fees. Because the\nFund is newly launched, no services have been\nprovided by BTC as the Fund\u2019s securities\nlending agent, and the Fund had no income and\nfees/compensation related to securities\nlending activities for the fiscal year ended\nAugust 31, 2023. Payments by BFA and its\nAffiliates. BFA and/or its affiliates ( \u201c BFA\nEntities \u201d ) may pay certain broker-dealers,\nregistered investment advisers, banks and\nother financial intermediaries ( \u201c\nIntermediaries \u201d ) for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products in general. BFA\nEntities make these payments from their own\nassets and not from the assets of the Fund.\nAlthough a portion of BFA Entities\u2019 revenue\ncomes directly or indirectly in part from fees\npaid by the Fund, other iShares funds\n(including, if applicable, any underlying\niShares funds held by a Fund) or exchange-\ntraded products, these payments do not\nincrease the price paid by investors for the\npurchase of shares of, or the cost of owning,\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. BFA Entities make payments\nfor Intermediaries\u2019 participation in\nactivities that are designed to make\nregistered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Fund and other iShares funds, or\nfor other activities, such as participation in\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products ( \u201c\nPublishing Costs \u201d ). In addition, BFA\nEntities make payments to Intermediaries that\nmake shares of the Fund, other iShares funds\nor exchange-traded products available to their\nclients, in some cases at a waived or reduced\ncommission rate or ticket charge, develop new\nproducts that feature iShares, create\neducational content about the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products that\nis featured on an Intermediary\u2019s platform, or\notherwise promote the Fund, other iShares\nfunds and exchange-traded products. BFA\nEntities may also reimburse expenses or make\npayments from their own assets to\nIntermediaries or other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\niShares business or facilitate investment in\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. Payments of the type\ndescribed above are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products, or otherwise promote\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm.\n\n60\n\nIn addition to the payments described above,\nBFA Entities have developed proprietary tools,\ncalculators and related interactive or digital\ncontent that is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Fund, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream\nFund Centre AG, Commonwealth Equity Services,\nLLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC,\nE*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset\nManagement, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc.,\nLPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\nFenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley\nSmith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual\nInvestment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio\nSolutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public Holdings,\nInc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.,\nRiskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC,\nStash Investments LLC, TD Ameritrade, Inc.,\nUBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo\nAdvisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFund, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Fund, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Fund may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Fund would pay a fee\nto the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of the Fund to enhance the\nliquidity and quality of the secondary market\nof securities of the Fund. The fee would then\nbe credited by the exchange to one or more\nmarket makers that meet or exceed liquidity\nand market quality standards with respect to\nthe securities of the Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of the\nFund solely for the benefit of the Fund and\nwill not be paid from any Fund assets. Other\nfunds managed by BFA may also participate in\nsuch programs.\n\n61\n\nDetermination of Net Asset Value Valuation of\nShares. The NAV for the Fund is generally\ncalculated as of the close of regular trading\nhours on the New York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE\n\u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each\nbusiness day the NYSE is open. Valuation of\nassets held by the Fund is as follows: Equity\nInvestments. Equity securities traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange ( e.g. , NYSE),\non separate trading boards of a securities\nexchange or through a market system that\nprovides contemporaneous transaction pricing\ninformation (each an \u201c Exchange \u201d ) are valued\nusing information obtained via independent\npricing services, generally at the closing\nprice or, if an Exchange closing price is not\navailable, the last traded price on that\nExchange prior to the time as of which the\nassets or liabilities are valued. However,\nunder certain circumstances, other means of\ndetermining current market value may be used.\nIf an equity security is traded on more than\none Exchange, the current market value of the\nsecurity where it is primarily traded\ngenerally will be used. In the event that\nthere are no sales involving an equity\nsecurity held by the Fund on a day on which\nthe Fund values such security, the prior day\u2019s\nprice will be used, unless BFA determines that\nsuch prior day\u2019s price no longer reflects the\nfair value of the security, in which case such\nasset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset\n(as defined below). Options, Futures, Swaps\nand Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded equity\noptions (except those that are customized) for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by the Fund on a day on which the Fund\nvalues such option, the last bid (long\npositions) or ask (short positions) price, if\navailable, will be used as the value of such\noption. If no bid or ask price is available on\na day on which the Fund values such option,\nthe prior day\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value the Fund\u2019s securities and\nother assets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time the Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich the Fund valued such security, the\nrevised pricing service quotation generally\nwill be applied prospectively. Such\ndetermination will be made considering\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding\nthe revision. The price the Fund could receive\nupon the sale of any particular portfolio\ninvestment may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the investment, particularly for\nassets that trade in thin or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair valuation\nmethodology or a price provided by an\nindependent pricing service. As a result, the\nprice received upon the sale of an investment\nmay be less than the value ascribed by the\nFund, and the Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain upon the sale of the investment. The\nFund\u2019s ability to value its investment may\nalso be impacted by technological issues\nand/or errors by pricing services or other\nthird-party service providers. All cash,\nreceivables and current payables are carried\non the Fund\u2019s books at their fair value. In\nthe event that application of the methods of\nvaluation discussed above result in a price\nfor a security which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, the Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by the Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates.\n\n62\n\nUse of fair value prices and certain current\nmarket valuations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate the\nFund\u2019s NAV and the prices used in the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn, could result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the Underlying Index.\nFair Value. When market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.\nOn any day the NYSE is open and a foreign\nmarket or the primary exchange on which a\nforeign asset or liability is traded is\nclosed, such asset or liability will be valued\nusing the prior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA\nis not aware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. For certain foreign assets, a third-\nparty vendor supplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the movement of\na proprietary multi-factor model after the\nrelevant foreign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing methodology is\ndesigned to correlate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S. markets\nfollowing the close of the local markets to\nthe prices that might have prevailed as of a\nFund\u2019s pricing time. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee\nis responsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition,\nthe Fund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of the Fund. The pricing of all\nFair Value Assets is subsequently reported to\nthe Board or a committee thereof. When\ndetermining the price for a Fair Value Asset,\nBFA will seek to determine the price that the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive from\nthe current sale of that asset or liability in\nan arm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on\nwhich the asset or liability is being valued,\nand does not seek to determine the price the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive for\nselling an asset or liability at a later time\nor if it holds the asset or liability to\nmaturity. Fair value determinations will be\nbased upon all available factors that BFA\ndeems relevant at the time of the\ndetermination, and may be based on analytical\nvalues determined by BFA using proprietary or\nthird-party valuation models. Fair value\nrepresents a good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset or liability. When\ndetermining the fair value of an investment,\none or more fair value methodologies may be\nused (depending on certain factors, including\nthe asset type). For example, the investment\nmay be initially priced based on the original\ncost of the investment or, alternatively,\nusing proprietary or third-party models that\nmay rely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nThe Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements.\n\n63\n\nGenerally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules\napplicable to funds and various assets in\nwhich they invest are evolving. Such changes\nmay adversely affect the Fund. For example,\nthe evolution of rules governing the\ndetermination of the fair market value of\nassets or liabilities, to the extent such\nrules become more stringent, would tend to\nincrease the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to the Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Fund,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, the Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including the\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause the Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for the Fund and may take into\naccount a variety of factors including: (i)\nthe size, nature and character of the security\nor instrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time,\nthe Fund may purchase new issues of securities\nin a fixed price offering. In these\nsituations, the broker may be a member of the\nselling group that will, in addition to\nselling securities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). The\nFund anticipates that brokerage transactions\ninvolving foreign equity securities generally\nwill be conducted primarily on the principal\nstock exchanges of the applicable country.\nForeign equity securities may be held by the\nFund in the form of depositary receipts, or\nother securities convertible into foreign\nequity securities. Depositary receipts may be\nlisted on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC\nmarkets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may\nbe. ADRs, like other securities traded in the\nU.S., will be subject to negotiated commission\nrates. OTC issues, including most fixed-income\nsecurities such as corporate debt and U.S.\nGovernment securities, are normally traded on\na \u201c net \u201d basis without a stated commission,\nthrough dealers acting for their own account\nand not as brokers. The Fund will primarily\nengage in transactions with these dealers or\ndeal directly with the issuer unless a better\nprice or execution could be obtained by using\na broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit.\n\n64\n\nUnder the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with\nthe Fund and persons who are affiliated with\nsuch affiliated persons are prohibited from\ndealing with the Fund as principal in the\npurchase and sale of securities unless a\npermissive order allowing such transactions is\nobtained from the SEC. Since transactions in\nthe OTC market usually involve transactions\nwith the dealers acting as principal for their\nown accounts, the Fund will not deal with\naffiliated persons and affiliated persons of\nsuch affiliated persons in connection with\nsuch transactions. The Fund will not purchase\nsecurities during the existence of any\nunderwriting or selling group relating to such\nsecurities of which BFA, BRIL or any\naffiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nthereof is a member except pursuant to\nprocedures adopted by the Board in accordance\nwith Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act. Purchases\nof money market instruments by the Fund are\nmade from dealers, underwriters and issuers.\nThe Fund does not currently expect to incur\nany brokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Fund\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Fund may invest. Initial public\nofferings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of securities may be\nover-subscribed and subsequently trade at a\npremium in the secondary market. When BFA is\ngiven an opportunity to invest in such an\ninitial offering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue,\nthe supply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in the Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well.\n\n65\n\nBecause different accounts may have differing\ninvestment objectives and policies, BFA may\nbuy and sell the same securities at the same\ntime for different clients based on the\nparticular investment objective, guidelines\nand strategies of those accounts. For example,\nBFA may decide that it may be entirely\nappropriate for a growth fund to sell a\nsecurity at the same time a value fund is\nbuying that security. To the extent that\ntransactions on behalf of more than one client\nof BFA or the other Affiliates during the same\nperiod increase the demand for securities\nbeing purchased or the supply of securities\nbeing sold, there may be an adverse effect on\nprice. For example, sales of a security by\nBlackRock on behalf of one or more of its\nclients may decrease the market price of such\nsecurity, adversely impacting other BlackRock\nclients that still hold the security. If\npurchases or sales of securities arise for\nconsideration at or about the same time that\nwould involve the Fund or other clients or\nfunds for which BFA or another Affiliate act\nas investment manager, transactions in such\nsecurities will be made, insofar as feasible,\nfor the respective funds and clients in a\nmanner deemed equitable to all. In certain\ninstances, BFA may find it efficient for\npurposes of seeking to obtain best execution,\nto aggregate or \u201c bunch \u201d certain\ncontemporaneous purchases or sale orders of\nits advisory accounts and advisory accounts of\naffiliates. In general, all contemporaneous\ntrades for client accounts under management by\nthe same portfolio manager or investment team\nwill be bunched in a single order if the\ntrader believes the bunched trade would\nprovide each client with an opportunity to\nachieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Fund is concerned,\nin other cases it could be beneficial to the\nFund. Transactions effected by BFA or the\nother Affiliates on behalf of more than one of\nits clients during the same period may\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, causing an adverse effect on price. The\ntrader will give the bunched order to the\nbroker-dealer that the trader has identified\nas being able to provide the best execution of\nthe order. Orders for purchase or sale of\nsecurities will be placed within a reasonable\namount of time of the order receipt and\nbunched orders will be kept bunched only long\nenough to execute the order. The Fund's\npurchase and sale orders for securities may be\ncombined with those of other investment\ncompanies, clients or accounts that BlackRock\nmanages or advises. If purchases or sales of\nportfolio securities of the Fund and one or\nmore other accounts managed or advised by\nBlackRock are considered at or about the same\ntime, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Fund and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Fund\nis concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFund. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for\nits own account in the types of securities in\nwhich the Fund may invest. BlackRock may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Fund\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses. Because the Fund\nis newly launched, there is no reportable\nportfolio turnover. Creation or redemption\ntransactions, to the extent consisting of\ncash, may require the Fund to\ncontemporaneously transact with broker-dealers\nfor purchases of Deposit Securities (as\ndefined below under Fund Deposit ) or sales of\nFund Securities (as defined below under\nRedemption of Creation Units ), as applicable.\nSuch transactions with a particular broker-\ndealer may be conditioned upon the broker-\ndealer's agreement to transact at guaranteed\nprice levels in order to reduce transaction\ncosts the Fund would otherwise incur as a\nconsequence of settling creation or redemption\nbaskets in cash rather than in-kind. Following\nthe Fund\u2019s receipt of an order to purchase or\nredeem creation or redemption baskets, to the\nextent such purchases or redemptions consist\nof a cash portion, the Fund will enter an\norder with a broker or dealer to purchase or\nsell the Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities, as applicable. The terms of such\norder may, depending on the timing of the\ntransaction and certain other factors, require\nthe broker or dealer to guarantee that the\nFund will achieve execution of its order at a\nprice at least as favorable to the Fund as the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the Deposit\nSecurities/Fund Securities used for purposes\nof calculating the NAV applied to the creation\nor redemption transaction giving rise to the\norder (the \u201c Execution Performance Guarantee \u201d\n). Such orders may be placed with the\npurchasing or redeeming Authorized Participant\n(or a broker-dealer affiliated with the\nAuthorized Participant or a third-party\nbroker-dealer engaged through the Authorized\nParticipant) in its\n\n66\n\ncapacity as a broker-dealer. The amount\npayable to the Fund in respect of any\nExecution Performance Guarantee will depend on\nthe results achieved by the executing firm and\nwill vary depending on market activity, timing\nand a variety of other factors. The Execution\nPerformance Guarantee will apply for any\norders executed by the Authorized Participant\n(or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-\ndealer), even if the trades have not settled\nbefore the redemption transaction settles. To\nensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee\nwill be honored on orders arising from\ncreation transactions executed by an\nAuthorized Participant (or an affiliated or\nunaffiliated broker-dealer), an Authorized\nParticipant is required to deposit an amount\nwith the Fund (the \u201c Execution Performance\nDeposit \u201d ). If the broker-dealer executing\nthe order achieves executions in market\ntransactions at a price more favorable than\nthe Fund\u2019s valuation of the Deposit\nSecurities, then the Authorized Participant\ngenerally may retain the benefit of the\nfavorable executions, and the Fund will return\nto the Authorized Participant the Execution\nPerformance Deposit. If, however, the broker-\ndealer executing the order is unable to\nachieve executions in market transactions at a\nprice at least equal to the Fund\u2019s valuation\nof the securities, the Fund retains the\nportion of the Execution Performance Deposit\nequal to the full amount of the execution\nshortfall (including any taxes, brokerage\ncommissions or other costs) and may require\nthe Authorized Participant to deposit any\nadditional amount required to cover the full\namount of the actual Execution Performance\nGuarantee. To ensure that an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee will be honored for\nbrokerage orders arising from redemption\ntransactions executed by an Authorized\nParticipant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated\nbroker-dealer) as broker-dealer, an Authorized\nParticipant agrees to pay the shortfall amount\n(the \u201c Execution Performance Offset \u201d ). If\nthe broker-dealer executing the order achieves\nexecutions in market transactions at a price\nmore favorable than the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe Fund Securities, then the Authorized\nParticipant generally may retain the benefit\nof the favorable executions and the Authorized\nParticipant is not called upon to honor the\nExecution Performance Offset. If, however, the\nbroker-dealer is unable to achieve executions\nin market transactions at a price at least\nequal to the Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nsecurities, the Fund will be entitled to the\nportion of the Execution Performance Offset\nequal to the full amount of the execution\nshortfall (including any taxes, brokerage\ncommissions or other costs). The circumstances\nunder which the Execution Performance\nGuarantee will be used and the expected amount\nof any Execution Performance Deposit or\nExecution Performance Offset for the Fund will\nbe disclosed in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time based on the actual experience of\nthe Fund. Additional Information Concerning\nthe Trust Shares. The Trust issues shares of\nbeneficial interests in the funds with no par\nvalue. The Board may designate additional\niShares funds. Each share issued by a fund has\na pro rata interest in the assets of that\nfund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange,\nsubscription or conversion rights and are\nfreely transferable. Each share is entitled to\nparticipate equally in dividends and\ndistributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the relevant fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of such fund on\nliquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Following the creation of the\ninitial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund\nand immediately prior to the commencement of\ntrading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.\n\n67\n\nAbsent an applicable exemption or other relief\nfrom the SEC or its staff, beneficial owners\nof more than 5% of the shares of a fund may be\nsubject to the reporting provisions of Section\n13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules\npromulgated thereunder. In addition, absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a\nfund and beneficial owners of 10% of the\nshares of a fund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be\nsubject to the insider reporting, short-swing\nprofit and short sale provisions of Section 16\nof the 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules\npromulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and\nInsiders should consult with their own legal\ncounsel concerning their obligations under\nSections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and\nexisting guidance provided by the SEC staff.\nIn accordance with the Trust's current\nAgreement and Declaration of Trust (the \u201c\nDeclaration of Trust \u201d ), the Board may,\nwithout shareholder approval (unless such\nshareholder approval is required by the\nDeclaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Fund. Shares of\nthe Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of the\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its\n\n68\n\nnominee. Payments by DTC Participants to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of\nshares held through such DTC Participants will\nbe governed by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with the Fund's\nlaunch, the Fund will be seeded through the\nsale of one or more Creation Units by the Fund\nto one or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof the Fund or the Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor the Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nThe Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\nthe Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund's NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the Listing Exchange closes earlier\nthan normal, the Fund may require orders to be\nplaced earlier in the day. The following table\nsets forth the number of shares of the Fund\nthat constitute a Creation Unit for the Fund\nand the approximate value of such Creation\nUnit as of December 4, 2023:\n                                              \n  Shares                    ApproximateValue  \n  PerCreation Unit   PerCreationUnit (U.S.$)  \n  60,000                          $1,500,000  \n                                              \nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of\nthe Fund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation\nUnit. The Board reserves the right to declare\na split or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of the Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board.\n\n69\n\nA \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to the Fund is\nany day the Fund is open for business,\nincluding any day when it satisfies redemption\nrequests as required by Section 22(e) of the\n1940 Act. The Fund is open for business any\nday on which the Listing Exchange on which the\nFund is listed for trading is open for\nbusiness. As of the date of this SAI, the\nListing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of the Fund\ngenerally consists of Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component computed as described\nbelow. Together, the Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component constitute the \u201c Fund\nDeposit, \u201d which, when combined with the\nFund\u2019s portfolio securities is designed to\ngenerate performance that has a collective\ninvestment profile similar to that of the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents\nthe minimum initial and subsequent investment\namount for a Creation Unit of the Fund. Such\nFund Deposit is applicable, subject to any\nadjustments as described below, to purchases\nof Creation Units of shares of the Fund until\nsuch time as the next-announced Fund Deposit\nis made available. The \u201c Cash Component \u201d is\nan amount equal to the difference between the\nNAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the\n\u201c Deposit Amount, \u201d which is an amount equal\nto the market value of the Deposit Securities,\nand serves to compensate for any differences\nbetween the NAV per Creation Unit and the\nDeposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities are the sole responsibility\nof the Authorized Participant purchasing the\nCreation Unit. The Fund generally offers\nCreation Units partially for cash, but may, in\ncertain circumstances, offer Creation Units\nsolely for cash or solely in-kind. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit\nSecurities change pursuant to changes in the\ncomposition of the Fund's portfolio and as\nrebalancing adjustments and corporate action\nevents are reflected from time to time by BFA\nwith a view to the investment objective of the\nFund. The composition of the Deposit\nSecurities may also change in response to\nadjustments to the weighting or composition of\nthe component securities constituting the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund Deposit may also be\nmodified to minimize the Cash Component by\nredistributing the cash to the Deposit\nSecurities portion of the Fund Deposit through\n\u201c systematic rounding. \u201d The rounding\nmethodology \u201c rounds up \u201d position sizes of\nsecurities in the Deposit Securities (which in\nturn reduces the cash portion). However, the\nmethodology limits the maximum allowed\npercentage change in weight and share quantity\nof any given security in the Fund Deposit.\nFund Deposits may also be modified to position\na fund towards a forward index rebalance to\nreflect revisions that account for index\nadditions, deletions, and re-weights. The\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the\nCash Component to replace any Deposit Security\nin certain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by the Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit full cash purchases of Creation Units\nof its funds, when partial or full cash\npurchases of Creation Units are available or\nspecified (Creation Units of the Fund are\ngenerally offered partially for cash), they\nwill be effected in essentially the same\nmanner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the\ncase of a partial or full cash purchase, the\nAuthorized Participant must pay the cash\nequivalent of the Deposit Securities it would\notherwise be required to provide through an\nin-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nThe Authorized Participant will also be\nrequired to pay certain transaction fees and\ncharges for cash purchases, as described\nbelow, and, if transacting as broker with the\nFund, may be required to cover certain\nbrokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution\nand price movement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Fund, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a\n\n70\n\nclearing agency registered with the SEC which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows such\nmember or participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of Creation Units is\nreferred to as an \u201c Authorized Participant. \u201d\nAll shares of the Fund, however created, will\nbe entered on the records of DTC in the name\nof Cede & Co. for the account of a DTC\nParticipant. Role of the Authorized\nParticipant. Creation Units may be purchased\nonly by or through a member or participant of\na clearing agency registered with the SEC,\nwhich has a written agreement with the Fund or\none of its service providers that allows such\nmember or participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of Creation Units (an\n\u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ). Such Authorized\nParticipant will agree, pursuant to the terms\nof such Authorized Participant Agreement and\non behalf of itself or any investor on whose\nbehalf it will act, to certain conditions,\nincluding that such Authorized Participant\nwill make available in advance of each\npurchase of shares an amount of cash\nsufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the\nNAV of a Creation Unit is next determined\nafter receipt of the purchase order in proper\nform, together with the transaction fees\ndescribed below. An Authorized Participant,\nacting on behalf of an investor, may require\nthe investor to enter into an agreement with\nsuch Authorized Participant with respect to\ncertain matters, including payment of the Cash\nComponent. Investors who are not Authorized\nParticipants must make appropriate\narrangements with an Authorized Participant.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not be a DTC Participant\nor may not have executed an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and that orders to\npurchase Creation Units may have to be placed\nby the investor's broker through an Authorized\nParticipant. As a result, purchase orders\nplaced through an Authorized Participant may\nresult in additional charges to such investor.\nThe Trust does not expect to enter into an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement with more\nthan a small number of DTC Participants. A\nlist of current Authorized Participants may be\nobtained from the Distributor. The Distributor\nhas adopted guidelines regarding Authorized\nParticipants\u2019 transactions in Creation Units\nthat are made available to all Authorized\nParticipants. These guidelines set forth the\nprocesses and standards for Authorized\nParticipants to transact with the Distributor\nand its agents in connection with creation and\nredemption transactions. In addition, the\nDistributor may be appointed as the proxy of\nthe Authorized Participant and may be granted\na power of attorney under its Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Purchase Orders. To\ninitiate an order for a Creation Unit, an\nAuthorized Participant must submit to the\nDistributor or its agent an irrevocable order\nto purchase shares of the Fund, in proper\nform, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day to receive that day\u2019s NAV.\nThe Distributor or its agent will notify BFA\nand the custodian of such order. The custodian\nwill then provide such information to any\nappropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and\nrequirements governing the delivery of the\nFund Deposit are set forth in the procedures\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Investors, other\nthan Authorized Participants, are responsible\nfor making arrangements for a creation request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFund, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Fund to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\ndeadline for cash transfers by contacting the\noperations department of the broker or\ndepositary institution effectuating the\ntransfer of the Cash Component. This deadline\nis likely to be significantly earlier than the\nCutoff Time of the Fund. Investors should be\naware that an Authorized Participant may\nrequire orders for purchases of shares placed\nwith it to be in the particular form required\nby the individual Authorized Participant. The\nAuthorized Participant is responsible for any\nand all expenses and costs incurred by the\nFund, including any applicable cash amounts,\nin connection with any purchase order. Timing\nof Submission of Purchase Orders. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable order to purchase shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Fund to the Distributor or its\nagent pursuant to procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Economic or\nmarket disruptions or changes, or telephone or\nother communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. Orders to create\nshares of the Fund that are submitted on the\nBusiness Day immediately preceding a holiday\nor a day (other than a weekend) when the\nequity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market\nare closed may not be accepted. The Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as the Fund's \u201c\nCutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\n\n71\n\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with the\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Fund are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFund will accept the order, subject to the\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once the Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. The Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, the Fund may reject or revoke a\ncreation order transmitted to it by the\nDistributor or its agent if (i) the order is\nnot in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding shares of\nthe Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not conform to the identity and\nnumber of shares specified, as described\nabove; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit\nSecurities is not legally required or would,\nin the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or (v)\ncircumstances outside the control of the Fund,\nthe Distributor or its agent and BFA make it\nimpracticable to process purchase orders. The\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a\nprospective purchaser of a Creation Unit\nand/or the Authorized Participant acting on\nbehalf of such purchaser of its rejection of\nsuch order. The Fund, State Street, the sub-\ncustodian and the Distributor or its agent are\nunder no duty, however, to give notification\nof any defects or irregularities in the\ndelivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of\nthem incur any liability for failure to give\nsuch notification. Issuance of a Creation\nUnit. Except as provided herein, a Creation\nUnit will not be issued until the transfer of\ngood title to the Fund of the Deposit\nSecurities and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the sub-\ncustodian has confirmed to the custodian that\nthe securities included in the Fund Deposit\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant sub-\ncustodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor\nor its agent and BFA shall be notified of such\ndelivery and the Fund will issue and cause the\ndelivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units\nare generally issued on a \u201c T+2 basis \u201d ( i.e.\n, two Business Days after trade date).\nHowever, the Fund reserves the right to settle\nCreation Unit transactions on a basis other\nthan T+2, including a shorter settlement\nperiod, if necessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. For example, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle Creation Unit transactions on a\nbasis other than T+2 in order to accommodate\nnon-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account\nfor different treatment among non-U.S. and\nU.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-\ndividend dates ( i.e. , the last day the\nholder of a security can sell the security and\nstill receive dividends payable on the\nsecurity) and in certain other circumstances.\nTo the extent contemplated by an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement with the Distributor,\nthe Fund will issue Creation Units to such\nAuthorized Participant, notwithstanding the\nfact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have\nnot been received in part or in whole, in\nreliance on the undertaking of the Authorized\nParticipant to deliver the missing Deposit\nSecurities as soon as possible, which\nundertaking shall be secured by such\nAuthorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\nbuy Deposit Securities for the Fund. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe contractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Fund's current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Fund to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Fund of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges. In certain cases,\nAuthorized Participants may create and redeem\nCreation Units on the same trade date and in\nthese instances, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to\n\n72\n\nthe number of shares of each security in the\nDeposit Securities and the validity, form,\neligibility and acceptance for deposit of any\nsecurities to be delivered shall be determined\nby the Fund and the Fund's determination shall\nbe final and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer, processing and other transaction\ncosts associated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. The standard creation transaction fee\nis charged on each Creation Unit created by an\nAuthorized Participant on the day of the\ntransaction. The standard creation transaction\nfee is generally fixed at the amount shown in\nthe table below regardless of the number of\nCreation Units being purchased, but may be\nreduced by the Fund if transfer and processing\nexpenses associated with the creation are\nanticipated to be lower than the stated fee.\nIf a purchase consists of a cash portion, the\nAuthorized Participant may also be required to\npay an additional transaction charge (up to\nthe maximum amount shown below) to cover\nbrokerage and certain other costs related to\nthe creation transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs). Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Deposit Securities to the\nFund. Certain fees/costs associated with\ncreation transactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\nacquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for\nsuch services. The following table sets forth\nthe Fund's standard creation transaction fees\nand maximum additional charge (as described\nabove):\n                                              \n  Standard                 Maximum            \n  CreationTransaction Fee  AdditionalCharge*  \n  $11,300                  7.0%               \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit. If a purchase consists of a\ncash portion and the Fund places a brokerage\ntransaction to purchase portfolio securities\nwith the Authorized Participant (or an\naffiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), the\nAuthorized Participant may be required, in its\ncapacity as broker-dealer with respect to that\ntransaction, to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution, and price\nmovement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nRedemption of Creation Units. Shares of the\nFund may be redeemed by Authorized\nParticipants only in Creation Units at their\nNAV next determined after receipt of a\nredemption request in proper form by the\nDistributor or its agent and only on a\nBusiness Day. The Fund will not redeem shares\nin amounts less than Creation Units. There can\nbe no assurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the secondary market\nat any time to permit assembly of a Creation\nUnit. Investors should expect to incur\nbrokerage and other costs in connection with\nassembling a sufficient number of shares to\nconstitute a Creation Unit that could be\nredeemed by an Authorized Participant.\nBeneficial owners also may sell shares in the\nsecondary market. The Fund generally redeems\nCreation Units partially for cash. However,\nthe Fund reserves the right to distribute\nsecurities and other portfolio instruments in-\nkind as payment for Creation Units being\nredeemed. Please see the Cash Redemption\nMethod section below and the following\ndiscussion summarizing the in-kind method for\nfurther information on redeeming Creation\nUnits of the Fund. The Fund publishes the\ndesignated portfolio of securities (including\nany portion of such securities for which cash\nmay be substituted) that will be applicable to\nredemption requests received in proper form\n(as defined below) on that day ( \u201c Fund\nSecurities \u201d or \u201c Redemption Basket \u201d ), and\nan amount of cash (the \u201c Cash Amount, \u201d as\ndescribed below) in order to effect\nredemptions of Creation Units of the Fund.\nSuch Fund Securities and Cash Amount will\nremain in effect until such time as the next\nannounced composition of the Fund Securities\nand Cash Amount is made available. The Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount are subject to\npossible amendment or correction. Fund\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. If redemptions are\nnot paid in cash, the redemption proceeds for\na Creation Unit generally consist of Fund\nSecurities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an\namount equal to the difference between the NAV\nof the shares being redeemed, as next\n\n73\n\ndetermined after the receipt of a redemption\nrequest in proper form, and the value of Fund\nSecurities, less a redemption transaction fee\n(as described below). The Trust may, in its\nsole discretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. The Fund generally\nredeems Creation Units partially for cash. The\nFund may, in its sole discretion, provide such\nredeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio\nof securities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Fund Securities, but does\nnot differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may\nalso be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index rebalance to reflect revisions\nthat account for index additions, deletions,\nand re-weights. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\nfull cash redemptions of Creation Units of its\nfunds, when partial or full cash redemptions\nof Creation Units are available or specified\n(Creation Units of the Fund are generally\nredeemed partially for cash or where the\nmarket for individual securities does not\npermit in-kind redemption), they will be\neffected in essentially the same manner as in-\nkind redemptions thereof. In the case of\npartial or full cash redemption, the\nAuthorized Participant receives the cash\nequivalent of the Fund Securities and other\ninstruments it would otherwise receive through\nan in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash\nAmount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer. The\nAuthorized Participant will also be required\nto pay certain transaction fees and charges\nfor cash redemptions, as described below, and,\nif transacting as broker with the Fund, may be\nrequired to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution and price movement\ncosts through an Execution Performance\nGuarantee, as described in the Brokerage\nTransactions section of this SAI. Cash\nredemption proceeds will be paid to the\nAuthorized Participant redeeming shares as\nsoon as practicable after the date of\nredemption or within seven calendar days\nthereafter. If a Fund settles redemptions on a\ncash basis and an Authorized Participant has\nentered into an Execution Performance\nGuarantee, but the Authorized Participant is\nunable, as determined by BFA in its sole\ndiscretion, to execute the market transactions\nthat are the subject of the Execution\nPerformance Guarantee due to an extended\nmarket holiday that goes over seven calendar\ndays or in certain other situations where all\nor a portion of the transactions are unable to\nbe executed within seven calendar days, then\nthe Fund may pay the full amount of the\nredemption order (or the remaining amount of\nthe redemption order based on the unexecuted\nportion of the transaction) within the\noriginal seven calendar day period by using\nthe Fund\u2019s overdraft facility, line of credit\nor cash on hand. The Authorized Participant\n(or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-\ndealer), acting on an agency basis, will\nsubsequently enter into one or more separate\nmarket transactions when the markets reopen or\nthe trades are otherwise able to be executed\nthrough which a Fund sells the Fund Securities\n(or the remaining unsold Fund Securities)\nsubject to a guaranteed sales price. If the\nAuthorized Participant (or an affiliated or\nunaffiliated broker-dealer) achieves\nexecutions in market transactions at a price\nmore favorable than a Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nFund Securities as of the NAV calculation\napplicable on the date of the redemption, then\nthe Authorized Participant generally may\nretain the excess transaction proceeds.\nSpecifically, if the Authorized Participant is\nunable to achieve executions in market\ntransactions at a price at least equal to the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the Fund Securities as of\nthe NAV calculation applicable on the date of\nthe redemption, then the Authorized\nParticipant is generally required to make the\napplicable shortfall payment to the Fund. In\naddition, if transacting as broker with a Fund\nin a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the Authorized\nParticipant may be required to cover foreign\nexchange costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI. If\nthe foreign exchange transaction associated\nwith the applicable security trades can only\noccur upon the settlement of a security trade\nand such trades are unable, as determined by\nBFA in its sole discretion, to be settled by\nthe seventh calendar day after receipt of the\nAuthorized Participant\u2019s redemption order,\nthen a Fund may pay within the original seven\ncalendar day period the amount due in respect\nof the redemption order based on the foreign\nexchange rate as of the\n\n74\n\ndate of the redemption order by using the\nFund\u2019s overdraft facility, line of credit or\ncash on hand (in addition to any sales\nproceeds from the executed portion of the\noriginal brokerage order) and subsequently\nenter into one or more separate foreign\nexchange transactions with the Authorized\nParticipant (or a broker-dealer affiliate of\nthe Authorized Participant or a third-party\nbroker-dealer engaged through the Authorized\nParticipant), acting on an agency basis, and\nbe subject to a guaranteed sales price. If the\nAuthorized Participant achieves execution of\nthe foreign exchange transactions at a price\nmore favorable than the foreign exchange rate\nas of the NAV calculation applicable on the\ndate of the redemption, then the Authorized\nParticipant generally may retain the excess\ntransaction proceeds. If the Authorized\nParticipant is unable to achieve execution of\nthe foreign exchange transactions at a price\nat least equal to the foreign exchange rate as\nof the NAV calculation applicable on the date\nof the redemption, then the Authorized\nParticipant is required to make the applicable\nshortfall payment to the Fund. Costs\nAssociated with Redemption Transactions. A\nstandard redemption transaction fee is imposed\nto offset transfer, processing and other\ntransaction costs that may be incurred by the\nFund. The standard redemption transaction fee\nis charged on each Creation Unit redeemed by\nan Authorized Participant on the day of the\ntransaction. The standard redemption\ntransaction fee is generally fixed at the\namount shown in the table below regardless of\nthe number of Creation Units being redeemed,\nbut may be reduced by the Fund if transfer and\nprocessing expenses associated with the\nredemption are anticipated to be lower than\nthe stated fee. If a redemption consists of a\ncash portion, the Authorized Participant may\nalso be required to pay an additional\ntransaction charge (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) to cover brokerage and certain\nother costs related to the redemption\ntransaction (which may, in certain instances,\nbe based on a good faith estimate of\ntransaction costs). Authorized Participants\nwill also bear the costs of transferring the\nFund Securities from the Fund to their account\non their order. Certain fees/costs associated\nwith redemption transactions may be waived in\ncertain circumstances. Investors who use the\nservices of a broker or other financial\nintermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be\ncharged a fee for such services. The following\ntable sets forth the Fund's standard\nredemption transaction fees and maximum\nadditional charge (as described above):\n                                              \n  Standard                 Maximum            \n  RedemptionTransaction    AdditionalCharge*  \n  Fee                                         \n  $11,300                  2.0%               \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\nredemption transaction fee. If a redemption\nconsists of a cash portion and the Fund places\na brokerage transaction to sell portfolio\nsecurities with the Authorized Participant (or\nan affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer),\nthe Authorized Participant may be required, in\nits capacity as broker-dealer with respect to\nthat transaction, to cover certain brokerage,\ntax, foreign exchange, execution, and price\nmovement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nPlacement of Redemption Orders. Redemption\nrequests for Creation Units of the Fund must\nbe submitted to the Distributor or its agent\nby or through an Authorized Participant. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable request to redeem shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, the Fund may\nrequire orders to redeem Creation Units to be\nplaced earlier that day. Investors, other than\nAuthorized Participants, are responsible for\nmaking arrangements for a redemption request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. The Authorized Participant must\ntransmit the request for redemption in the\nform required by the Fund to the Distributor\nor its agent in accordance with procedures set\nforth in the Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that,\ntherefore, requests to redeem Creation Units\nmay have to be placed by the investor's broker\nthrough an Authorized Participant who has\nexecuted an Authorized Participant Agreement.\nAt any time, only a limited number of broker-\ndealers will have an Authorized Participant\nAgreement in effect. Investors making a\nredemption request should be aware that such\nrequest must be in the form specified by such\nAuthorized Participant. Investors making a\nrequest to redeem Creation Units should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe request by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Fund's transfer\nagent; such\n\n75\n\ninvestors should allow for the additional time\nthat may be required to effect redemptions\nthrough their banks, brokers or other\nfinancial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Fund's\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the Fund is\nreceived by the Distributor or its agent from\nthe Authorized Participant on behalf of itself\nor another redeeming investor within the time\nperiods specified above; and (iii) all other\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement are properly followed.\nUpon receiving a redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent shall notify the Fund\nand the Fund's transfer agent of such\nredemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds by the Fund are generally made within\ntwo Business Days ( i.e ., \u201c T+2 \u201d ). However,\nthe Fund reserves the right to settle\nredemption transactions on a basis other than\nT+2, including a shorter settlement period, if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. For example, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle redemption transactions on a basis\nother than T+2 in order to accommodate\nnon-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account\nfor different treatment among non-U.S. and\nU.S. markets of dividend record dates and\ndividend ex-dates ( i.e. , the last date the\nholder of a security can sell the security and\nstill receive dividends payable on the\nsecurity sold) and in certain other\ncircumstances consistent with applicable law.\nIf neither the Authorized Participant nor the\nBeneficial Owner on whose behalf the\nAuthorized Participant is acting has\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nFund Securities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, the Fund may\nin its discretion exercise its option to\nredeem such shares in cash, and the Beneficial\nOwner will be required to receive its\nredemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the\ninvestor will receive a cash payment equal to\nthe net asset value of its shares based on the\nNAV of the Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charges specified above to offset\nthe Fund's brokerage and other transaction\ncosts associated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and the Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right\nto redeem Creation Units for cash to the\nextent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver\nspecific Fund Securities upon redemptions or\ncannot do so without first registering the\nFund Securities under such laws. Although the\nTrust does not ordinarily permit cash\nredemptions of Creation Units (except that, as\nnoted above, Creation Units of the Fund\ngenerally will be redeemed partially for\ncash), in the event that cash redemptions are\npermitted or required by the Trust, proceeds\nwill be paid to the Authorized Participant\nredeeming shares as soon as practicable after\nthe date of redemption (within seven calendar\ndays thereafter). If the Fund includes a\nforeign investment in its basket, and if a\nlocal market holiday, or series of consecutive\nholidays, or the extended delivery cycles for\ntransferring foreign investments to redeeming\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of the foreign investment in response\nto a redemption request, the Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if the Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant's\nagreement with the Distributor or its agent,\nin the event an Authorized Participant has\nsubmitted a redemption request in proper form\nbut is unable to transfer all or part of the\nCreation Unit to be redeemed to the Fund, at\nor prior to the time specified by the Fund or\nits custodian on the Business Day after the\ndate of submission of such redemption request,\nthe Distributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business\n\n76\n\nDay after the date of submission of such\nredemption request and shall be held by State\nStreet and marked-to-market daily. The fees of\nState Street and any sub-custodians in respect\nof the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of\nthe collateral shall be payable by the\nAuthorized Participant. The Authorized\nParticipant Agreement permits the Fund to\nacquire shares of the Fund at any time and\nsubjects the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the\naggregate of the cost to the Fund of\npurchasing such shares, plus the value of the\nCash Amount, and the value of the collateral\ntogether with liability for related brokerage\nand other charges. Because the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund may trade on\nexchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange\nis closed or are otherwise not Business Days\nfor the Fund, shareholders may not be able to\nredeem their shares of the Fund or purchase or\nsell shares of the Fund on the Listing\nExchange on days when the NAV of the Fund\ncould be significantly affected by events in\nthe relevant non-U.S. markets. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of\npayment postponed with respect to the Fund:\n(i) for any period during which the Listing\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Listing\nExchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for\nany period during which an emergency exists as\na result of which disposal of the shares of\nthe Fund's portfolio securities or\ndetermination of its NAV is not reasonably\npracticable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Fund may accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\nthe Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. The Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of the Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of the Fund may be taken\ninto account. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for the Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Fund, as set forth in the\nFund's policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets.\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of the\nFund. This summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to the Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in the\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Regulated Investment\nCompany Qualifications. The Fund intends to\nqualify for treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet\n\n77\n\nseveral other requirements. Among such other\nrequirements are the following: (i) at least\n90% of the Fund\u2019s annual gross income must be\nderived from dividends, interest, payments\nwith respect to securities loans, gains from\nthe sale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of the\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of the Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of the\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. The Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, the Fund fails one of these\ntests and does not timely cure the failure,\nthe Fund will be taxed in the same manner as\nan ordinary corporation and distributions to\nits shareholders will not be deductible by the\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. The\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, the Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, the Fund\nmust distribute to its shareholders at least\nthe sum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than its\nnet realized long-term capital gain over its\nnet realized short-term capital loss), plus or\nminus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its\nnet tax-exempt income for the taxable year.\nThe Fund will be subject to income tax at\nregular corporate rates on any taxable income\nor gains that it does not distribute to its\nshareholders. If the Fund fails to qualify for\nany taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the\ndistribution requirement, all of its taxable\nincome will be subject to tax at regular\ncorporate income tax rates without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand such distributions generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends\nto the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although the\nFund intends to distribute substantially all\nof its net investment income and its capital\ngains for each taxable year, the Fund may\ndecide to retain a portion of its income or\ngains if the Fund determines that doing so is\nin the interest of its shareholders. The Fund\nwill be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. If the Fund fails\nto qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay\nout its earnings and profits accumulated in\nthat year in order to qualify again as a RIC.\nIf the Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a\nperiod greater than two taxable years, the\nFund may be required to recognize any net\nbuilt-in gains with respect to certain of its\nassets ( i.e., the excess of the aggregate\ngains, including items of income, over\naggregate losses that would have been realized\nwith respect to such assets if the Fund had\nbeen liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Excise Tax. The Fund will be\nsubject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by the Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. The Fund intends to declare and\ndistribute dividends and distributions in the\namounts and at the times necessary to avoid\nthe application of this 4% excise tax.\n\n78\n\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards. Net capital\nloss carryforwards may be applied against any\nnet realized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that the Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of the Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. Taxation of U.S.\nShareholders. Dividends and other\ndistributions by the Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by the Fund\nin October, November or December of any\ncalendar year and payable to shareholders of\nrecord on a specified date in such a month\nshall be deemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if the Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\nthe Fund reports as capital gains dividends\nare taxable as long-term capital gains,\nwhether paid in cash or in shares and\nregardless of how long a shareholder has held\nshares of the Fund. All other dividends of the\nFund (including dividends from short-term\ncapital gains) from its current and\naccumulated earnings and profits ( \u201c regular\ndividends \u201d ) are generally subject to tax as\nordinary income, subject to the discussion of\nqualified dividend income below. Long-term\ncapital gains are eligible for taxation at a\nmaximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate\nshareholders, depending on whether their\nincome exceeds certain threshold amounts. If\nan individual receives a regular dividend\nqualifying for the long-term capital gains\nrates and such dividend constitutes an \u201c\nextraordinary dividend, \u201d and the individual\nsubsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or\nexchange of stock in respect of which the\nextraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss\nwill be long-term capital loss to the extent\nof such extraordinary dividend. An \u201c\nextraordinary dividend \u201d on common stock for\nthis purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an\namount greater than or equal to 10% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within an 85-day period, or\n(ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within a 365-day period.\nDistributions in excess of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits will, as\nto each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free\nreturn of capital to the extent of a\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund, and\nas a capital gain thereafter (if the\nshareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets). Distributions in excess of\nthe Fund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements,\nbut not in excess of the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. Shareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on net investment\nincome, including, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates and trusts.\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution\n\n79\n\nmay nevertheless be taxable to them. If the\nFund is the holder of record of any security\non the record date for any dividends payable\nwith respect to such security, such dividends\nwill be included in the Fund\u2019s gross income\nnot as of the date received but as of the\nlater of (a) the date such security became ex-\ndividend with respect to such dividends ( i.e.\n, the date on which a buyer of the security\nwould not be entitled to receive the declared,\nbut unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the\nFund acquired such security. Accordingly, in\norder to satisfy its income distribution\nrequirements, the Fund may be required to pay\ndividends based on anticipated earnings, and\nshareholders may receive dividends in an\nearlier year than would otherwise be the case.\nIn certain situations, the Fund may, for a\ntaxable year, defer all or a portion of its\nnet capital loss (or if there is no net\ncapital loss, then any net long-term or short-\nterm capital loss) realized after October and\nits late-year ordinary loss (defined as the\nsum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign\ncurrency and passive foreign investment\ncompany ( \u201c PFIC \u201d ) losses over post-October\nforeign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the\nexcess of post-December ordinary losses over\npost-December ordinary income) until the next\ntaxable year in computing its investment\ncompany taxable income and net capital gain,\nwhich will defer the recognition of such\nrealized losses. Such deferrals and other\nrules regarding gains and losses realized\nafter October (or December) may affect the tax\ncharacter of shareholder distributions. Sales\nof Shares. Upon the sale or exchange of shares\nof the Fund, a shareholder will realize a\ntaxable gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized and the\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund. A\nredemption of shares by the Fund will be\ntreated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain\nor loss will be treated as capital gain or\nloss if the shares are capital assets in the\nshareholder\u2019s hands and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor more than one year and short-term capital\ngain or loss if the shares are held for one\nyear or less. Any loss realized on a sale or\nexchange will be disallowed to the extent the\nshares disposed of are replaced, including\nreplacement through the reinvesting of\ndividends or capital gains distributions, or\nby an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of the Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, the Fund will be required to withhold\nat a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury\nsuch amounts withheld from any distributions\npaid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to the\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability. Sections 351 and 362. The Trust, on\nbehalf of the Fund, has the right to reject an\norder for a purchase of shares of the Fund if\nthe purchaser (or group of purchasers) would,\nupon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80%\nor more of the outstanding shares of the Fund\nand if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, the Fund would have\na basis in the securities different from the\nmarket value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. If the Fund\u2019s basis in such\nsecurities on the date of deposit was less\nthan market value on such date, the Fund, upon\ndisposition of the securities, would recognize\nmore taxable gain or less taxable loss than if\nits basis in the securities had been equal to\nmarket value. It is not anticipated that the\nTrust will exercise the right of rejection\nexcept in a case where the Trust determines\nthat accepting the order could result in\nmaterial adverse tax consequences to the Fund\nor its shareholders. The Trust also has the\nright to require information necessary to\ndetermine beneficial share ownership for\npurposes of the 80% determination.\n\n80\n\nTaxation of Certain Derivatives. The Fund\u2019s\ntransactions in zero coupon securities,\nnon-U.S. currencies, forward contracts,\noptions and futures contracts (including\noptions and futures contracts on non-U.S.\ncurrencies), to the extent permitted, will be\nsubject to special provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code (including provisions relating to\n\u201c hedging transactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d )\nthat, among other consequences, may affect the\ncharacter of gains and losses realized by the\nFund ( i.e. , may affect whether gains or\nlosses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer\nFund losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also (a) will require the Fund to\nmark-to-market certain types of the positions\nin its portfolio ( i.e. , treat them as if\nthey were closed out at the end of each year)\nand (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income\nwithout receiving cash with which to pay\ndividends or make distributions in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\ntaxes. The Fund will monitor its transactions,\nwill make the appropriate tax elections and\nwill make the appropriate entries in its books\nand records when it acquires any zero coupon\nsecurity, non-U.S. currency, forward contract,\noption, futures contract or hedged investment\nin order to mitigate the effect of these rules\nand prevent disqualification of the Fund as a\nRIC. The Fund\u2019s investments in so-called \u201c\nSection 1256 contracts, \u201d such as regulated\nfutures contracts, most non-U.S. currency\nforward contracts traded in the interbank\nmarket and options on most security indexes,\nare subject to special tax rules. All Section\n1256 contracts held by the Fund at the end of\nits taxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by the Fund from positions in Section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by the Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, the Fund may\nmake or receive periodic net payments. The\nFund may also make or receive a payment when a\nswap is terminated prior to maturity through\nan assignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Fund has been a party to the swap\nfor more than one year). With respect to\ncertain types of swaps, the Fund may be\nrequired to currently recognize income or loss\nwith respect to future payments on such swaps\nor may elect under certain circumstances to\nmark such swaps to market annually for tax\npurposes as ordinary income or loss. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by the Fund of\ninvestment company taxable income (including\nany short-term capital gains), whether\nreceived in cash or shares, will be taxable\neither as ordinary income or as qualified\ndividend income, which is eligible to be taxed\nat long-term capital gain rates to the extent\nthe Fund receives qualified dividend income on\nthe securities it holds and the Fund reports\nthe distribution as qualified dividend income.\nQualified dividend income is, in general,\ndividend income from taxable U.S. corporations\n(but generally not from U.S. REITs) and\ncertain non-U.S. corporations ( e.g. ,\nnon-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and\nwhich are incorporated in a possession of the\nU.S. or in certain countries with a\ncomprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the\nstock of which is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the U.S.\n(where the dividends are paid with respect to\nsuch stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the\nU.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax\ntreaties with the following countries:\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados,\nBelgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China (but not with\nHong Kong, which is treated as a separate\njurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus,\nthe Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia,\nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\nRomania, Russia, the Slovak Republic,\nSlovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,\nSri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand,\nTrinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine,\nthe U.K. and Venezuela. Substitute payments\nreceived by the Fund for securities lent out\nby the Fund will not be qualified dividend\nincome. A dividend from the Fund will not be\ntreated as qualified dividend income to the\nextent that: (i) the shareholder has not held\nthe shares on which the dividend was paid for\n61 days during the 121-day period that begins\non the date that is 60 days before the date on\nwhich the shares become ex-dividend with\nrespect to such dividend or the Fund fails to\nsatisfy those holding period requirements with\nrespect to the securities it holds that paid\nthe dividends distributed to the shareholder\n(or, in the case of certain preferred stocks,\nthe holding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) the Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by\nthe Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be\n\n81\n\ntreated as qualified dividend income only to\nthe extent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by the Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by the Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by the Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify\nfor the U.S. federal dividends received\ndeduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum\nholding period during the 90-day period that\nbegins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or\n91-day minimum holding period during the 180\nperiod beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend\ndate for certain preference dividends) during\nwhich risk of loss may not be diminished is\nrequired for the applicable shares, at both\nthe Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend\nto be eligible for the dividends received\ndeduction. Restrictions may apply if\nindebtedness, including a short sale, is\nattributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Fund\nserves to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by its\ntax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in\nthe Fund if shares in the Fund constitute\ndebt-financed property in the hands of the\ntax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by the Fund\nfrom REITs, real estate mortgage investment\nconduits, taxable mortgage pools or other\ninvestments may cause the Fund to report some\nor all of its distributions as \u201c excess\ninclusion income. \u201d To Fund shareholders, such\nexcess inclusion income may: (i) constitute\ntaxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders\nwho would otherwise be tax-exempt such as\nindividual retirement accounts, 401(k)\naccounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and\ncertain charitable entities; (ii) not be\noffset by otherwise allowable deductions for\ntax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for\nreduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S.\nshareholders even from tax treaty countries;\nand (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax\nif certain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust. The Fund tries to avoid\ninvesting in REITs that are expected to\ngenerate excess inclusion income, but the Fund\nmay not always be successful in doing so.\nBecause information about a REIT\u2019s investments\nmay be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a\nREIT may change its investment program, the\nFund may not be successful in avoiding the\nconsequences described above. Avoidance of\ninvestments in REITs that generate excess\ninclusion income may require the Fund to\nforego otherwise attractive investment\nopportunities. Non-U.S. Investments. Under\nSection 988 of the Internal Revenue Code,\ngains or losses attributable to fluctuations\nin exchange rates between the time the Fund\naccrues income or receivables or expenses or\nother liabilities denominated in a non-U.S.\ncurrency and the time the Fund actually\ncollects such income or pays such liabilities\nare generally treated as ordinary income or\nordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses)\nrealized on debt instruments will be treated\nas Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent\nattributable to changes in exchange rates\nbetween the U.S. dollar and the currencies in\nwhich the instruments are denominated.\nSimilarly, gains or losses on non-U.S.\ncurrency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts\nand certain non-U.S. currency options or\nfutures contracts denominated in non-U.S.\ncurrency, to the extent attributable to\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the\nacquisition and disposition dates, are also\ntreated as ordinary income or loss unless the\nFund were to elect otherwise. The Fund may be\nsubject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at\nthe source. The Fund, if permitted to do so,\nmay elect to \u201c pass through \u201d to its investors\nthe amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by\nthe Fund provided that the Fund held the\nsecurity on the dividend settlement date and\nfor at least 15 additional days immediately\nbefore and/or thereafter, with the result that\neach investor with respect to shares of the\nFund held for a minimum 16-day holding period\nat the time of deemed distribution will (i)\ninclude in gross income, even though not\nactually received, the investor\u2019s pro rata\nshare of the Fund\u2019s non-U.S. income taxes, and\n(ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S.\ntaxable income, but only for investors who\nitemize their deductions on their personal tax\nreturns) or credit (in calculating U.S.\nfederal income tax) the investor\u2019s pro rata\nshare of the Fund\u2019s non-U.S. income taxes.\nWithholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S.\nsecurities while such securities are lent out\nby the Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax\ncredit pass through. Taxes not \u201c passed\nthrough \u201d for tax purposes will not be\navailable to\n\n82\n\nshareholders for foreign tax credit purposes.\nA non-U.S. person invested in the Fund in a\nyear that the Fund elects to \u201c pass through \u201d\nits non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving\nadditional dividend income subject to U.S.\nwithholding tax. A non-U.S. tax credit may not\nexceed the investor\u2019s U.S. federal income tax\notherwise payable with respect to the\ninvestor\u2019s non-U.S. source income. For this\npurpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S.\nsource gross income (i) their proportionate\nshares of non-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and\n(ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the\nFund that represents income derived from\nnon-U.S. sources; the Fund\u2019s gain from the\nsale of securities will generally be treated\nas U.S.-source income. Certain limitations\nwill be imposed to the extent to which the\nnon-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your\nFund shares are loaned pursuant to securities\nlending arrangements, you may lose the ability\nto use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through\nby the Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid\nwhile the shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\nwith respect to shares of the Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. Passive Foreign Investment Companies.\nIf the Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax on a\nportion of any \u201c excess distribution \u201d or gain\nfrom the disposition of such shares even if\nsuch income is distributed as a taxable\ndividend by the Fund to its shareholders.\nAdditional charges in the nature of interest\nmay be imposed on the Fund in respect of\ndeferred taxes arising from such distributions\nor gains. If the Fund were to invest in a PFIC\nand elect to treat the PFIC as a \u201c qualified\nelecting fund \u201d under the Internal Revenue\nCode, in lieu of the foregoing requirements,\nthe Fund might be required to include in\nincome each year a portion of the ordinary\nearnings and net capital gains of the\nqualified electing fund, even if not\ndistributed to the Fund, and such amounts\nwould be subject to the 90% and excise tax\ndistribution requirements described above. In\norder to make this election, the Fund would be\nrequired to obtain certain annual information\nfrom the PFICs in which it invests, which may\nbe difficult or impossible to obtain.\nAlternatively, the Fund may make a mark-to-\nmarket election that would result in the Fund\nbeing treated as if it had sold and\nrepurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each\nyear. In such case, the Fund would report any\nsuch gains as ordinary income and would deduct\nany such losses as ordinary losses to the\nextent of previously recognized gains. The\nelection must be made separately for each PFIC\nowned by the Fund and, once made, would be\neffective for all subsequent taxable years,\nunless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By\nmaking the election, the Fund could\npotentially ameliorate the adverse tax\nconsequences with respect to its ownership of\nshares in a PFIC, but in any particular year\nmay be required to recognize income in excess\nof the distributions it receives from PFICs\nand its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC\nstock. The Fund may have to distribute this \u201c\nphantom \u201d income and gain to satisfy the 90%\ndistribution requirement and to avoid\nimposition of the 4% excise tax. The Fund will\nmake the appropriate tax elections, if\npossible, and take any additional steps that\nare necessary to mitigate the effects of these\nrules. Reporting. If a shareholder recognizes\na loss with respect to the Fund\u2019s shares of $2\nmillion or more for an individual shareholder\nor $10 million or more for a corporate\nshareholder, the shareholder must file with\nthe IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form\n8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio\nsecurities are in many cases exempted from\nthis reporting requirement, but under current\nguidance, shareholders of a RIC are not\nexempted. The fact that a loss is reportable\nunder these regulations does not affect the\nlegal determination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by the Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by the Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally not subject to such\nwithholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced\nrate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN\nor IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its\nentitlement to benefits under a treaty. The\nwithholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor\n\n83\n\nbusiness within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Properly-reported\ndividends are generally exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax where they (i) are\npaid in respect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net\ninterest income \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S.\nsource interest income, other than certain\ncontingent interest and interest from\nobligations of a corporation or partnership in\nwhich the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder\nor partner, reduced by expenses that are\nallocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term\ncapital gains \u201d (generally, the excess of the\nFund\u2019s net short-term capital gain over the\nFund\u2019s long-term capital loss for such taxable\nyear). However, depending on its\ncircumstances, the Fund may report all, some\nor none of its potentially eligible dividends\nas such qualified net interest income or as\nqualified short-term capital gains and/or\ntreat such dividends, in whole or in part, as\nineligible for this exemption from\nwithholding. In order to qualify for this\nexemption from withholding, a non-U.S.\nshareholder will need to comply with\napplicable certification requirements relating\nto its non-U.S. status (including, in general,\nfurnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of\nshares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if the Fund\nreports the payment as qualified net interest\nincome or qualified short-term capital gain.\nNon-U.S. shareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts. Special\nrules may apply to a foreign shareholder\nreceiving a Fund distribution if at least 50%\nof the Fund\u2019s assets consist of interests in\nU.S. real property interests, including\ncertain REITs and U.S. real property holding\ncorporations (as defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund\ndistributions that are attributable to gain\nfrom the disposition of a U.S. real property\ninterest will be taxable as ordinary dividends\nand subject to withholding at a 30% or lower\ntreaty rate if the foreign shareholder held no\nmore than 5% of the Fund\u2019s shares at any time\nduring the one-year period ending on the date\nof the distribution. If the foreign\nshareholder held at least 5% of the Fund\u2019s\nshares, the distribution would be treated as\nincome effectively connected with a trade or\nbusiness within the U.S. and the foreign\nshareholder would be subject to withholding\ntax at a rate of 21% and would generally be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences would generally\napply to a foreign shareholder\u2019s gain on the\nsale of Fund shares unless the Fund is\ndomestically controlled (meaning that more\nthan 50% of the value of the Fund\u2019s shares is\nheld by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign\nshareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund\u2019s\nshares at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of sale. Finally, a\ndomestically controlled Fund may be required\nto recognize a portion of its gain on the in-\nkind distribution of certain U.S. real\nproperty interests. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund. The rules\nlaid out in the previous two paragraphs, other\nthan the withholding rules, will apply\nnotwithstanding the Fund\u2019s participation in a\nwash sale transaction or its payment of a\nsubstitute dividend.

Separately,\na 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to: (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply.\n\n84\n\nShares of the Fund held by a non-U.S.\nshareholder at death will be considered\nsituated within the U.S. and subject to the\nU.S. estate tax.

We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017.

Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties.

Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals. We also publish a quarterly list of\nall companies with which we engaged and the\nkey topics addressed in the engagement\nmeeting. In this way, we help inform our\nclients about the work we do on their behalf\nin promoting the governance and business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\n11 The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.\n\nA-15\n\nIS-SAI-EVLU-0824\n"
