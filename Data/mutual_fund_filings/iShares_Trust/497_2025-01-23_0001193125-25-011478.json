  "text": "iShares \u00ae\n\niShares Trust, iShares U.S. ETF Trust, and\niShares, Inc.\n\n(collectively, the \u0093Companies\u0094)\n\nSupplement dated January 23, 2025 to\n\nthe currently effective Statement of\nAdditional Information\n\nfor each series of the Companies (each, a\n\u0093Fund\u0094)\n\nEffective immediately, the section entitled\n\u0093Investment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services \u0097 Payments by BFA and\nits Affiliates\u0094 in each\nFund\u0092s Statement of Additional Information is\ndeleted in its entirety and replaced with the\nfollowing:\n\nPayments by BFA and its Affiliates. BFA and/or\nits affiliates (\u0093BFA Entities\u0094) pay certain\nbroker-dealers, registered investment\nadvisers, banks and other financial\nintermediaries (\u0093Intermediaries\u0094) for certain\nactivities related to the Fund and other funds\nor products\nsponsored and/or advised by BFA Entities\n(collectively for purposes of this section,\nthe \u0093Products\u0094). BFA Entities make these\npayments from their own assets and not from\nthe assets of the Fund. Although a portion of\nBFA Entities\u0092\nrevenue comes directly or indirectly in part\nfrom fees paid by the Fund or other Products\n(including, if applicable, any underlying\nProducts held by the Fund), these payments do\nnot increase the price paid by investors for\nthe purchase of shares of,\nor the cost of owning, the Fund or other\nProducts. BFA Entities make payments for\nIntermediaries\u0092 participation in activities\nthat are designed to make registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors more knowledgeable\nabout exchange-traded products, including the\nFund and other Products, or for other\nactivities, such as participation in marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems (\u0093Education Costs\u0094). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Fund or\nother Products (\u0093Publishing Costs\u0094). In\naddition,\nBFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries\nthat make shares of the Fund or other Products\navailable to their clients, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, develop new products that feature\niShares, create\neducational content about the Fund or other\nProducts that is featured on an Intermediary\u0092s\nplatform, or otherwise promote the Fund or\nother Products. BFA Entities may also\nreimburse expenses or make payments from their\nown assets to\nIntermediaries or other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\nbusiness of the BFA Entities or facilitate\ninvestment in the Fund or other Products.\nPayments of the type described above\nare sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing\npayments.\n\nPayments to an Intermediary may be significant\nto the Intermediary, and amounts that\nIntermediaries pay to\nyour salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its\nclients, what services to provide for various\nproducts or what marketing content to make\navailable to its clients based on payments it\nreceives or is eligible to receive, such\npayments may create conflicts of interest\nbetween the Intermediary and\nits clients. These financial incentives may\ncause the Intermediary to recommend the Fund\nor other Products or otherwise promote the\nFund or other Products over other investments.\nThe same conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with\nrespect to your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional if he or she receives\nsimilar payments from his or her Intermediary\nfirm.\n\nIn addition to the payments\ndescribed above, BFA Entities have developed\nproprietary tools, calculators and related\ninteractive or digital content that is made\navailable through the www.blackrock.com\nwebsite at no additional cost to\nIntermediaries. BlackRock may configure\nthese tools and calculators and localize the\ncontent for Intermediaries as part of its\ncustomary digital marketing support and\npromotion of the Fund or other Products.\n\nAs of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have\ncontractual arrangements to make payments (in\naddition to payments for Education Costs or\nPublishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n(\u0093FBS\u0094). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC\n\n(\u0093NFS\u0094), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this\nspecial, long-term and significant arrangement\n(the \u0093Marketing Program\u0094), FBS, NFS and\ncertain of their affiliates (collectively\n\u0093Fidelity\u0094) have agreed, among other things,\nto actively promote certain funds and Products\nto customers, investment professionals and\nother intermediaries and in advertising\ncampaigns as the preferred exchange-traded\nproduct, to offer\ncertain funds and Products in certain Fidelity\nplatforms and investment programs, in some\ncases at a waived or reduced commission rate\nor ticket charge, and to provide marketing\ndata to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed\nto facilitate the\nMarketing Program by, among other things,\nmaking certain payments to FBS and NFS for\nmarketing and implementing certain brokerage\nand investment programs. Upon termination of\nthe arrangement, the BFA Entities will make\nadditional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period.\n\nIn addition, BFA Entities have entered into\nother contractual arrangements with\nIntermediaries and certain other third parties\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit\nthe business of the BFA Entities or facilitate\ninvestment in the Fund or certain Products.\nSuch agreements can include payments by BFA\nEntities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform\nenhancement, or educational content, co-\nmarketing and cross-promotional efforts. In\ncertain cases, such payments to Intermediaries\nare subject to certain minimum payment levels\nor tiered payments. With respect\nto certain funds and Products, payments by the\nBFA Entities may take the form of, among other\nthings, \u0093due diligence\u0094 payments for an\nIntermediary\u0092s review of such funds and\nProducts; payment for providing employee\ntraining and\ninformation relating to such funds and\nProducts; fees for access (in some cases on a\npreferential basis) to an Intermediary\u0092s\nregistered representatives, salespersons or\nother personnel, fees for maintaining an\nIntermediary\u0092s investor\nplatform, \u0093shelf space\u0094 payments for making\nsuch funds and Products available on the\nIntermediary\u0092s platform or fees for providing\nassistance in promoting the sale of such funds\nand Products. In such cases, the payments to\nIntermediaries may be tiered or based on a\npercentage of the value of the funds and\nProducts held by customers of the applicable\nIntermediary and may also be subject to\nminimum payment levels. Payments made pursuant\nto such arrangements may vary in\nany year and may be different for different\nIntermediaries and third parties and may\nreflect different services provided. As of the\ndate of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other\nthird parties (or their respective affiliates)\nreceiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\n&Partners, Advisor Credit Exchange, AE Wealth\nManagement, LLC, American Enterprise\nInvestment Services, Inc., Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon\nCapital Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &\nRisk Analytics, LLC, Cetera Financial Group,\nInc., Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream\nFund Centre AG, Commonwealth Equity Services,\nLLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC,\nDynasty\nFinancial Partners LLC, E*Trade Securities\nLLC, Envestnet Asset Management, Inc., LPL\nFinancial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &\nSmith Incorporated, MML Investors Services,\nLLC, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC,\nNorthwestern Mutual\nInvestment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio\nSolutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Raymond James\nFinancial Services, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc.,\nSanctuary Wealth Group, LLC, TD Ameritrade,\nInc., UBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC and\nWells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC.\nAny additions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\n\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u0092s\nservices at defined levels or an amount based\non the Intermediary\u0092s net sales of one or more\nProducts, including the Fund, in a year or\nother period, any of which arrangements may\ninclude an agreed-upon minimum or maximum\npayment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. Please contact\nyour salesperson or other investment\nprofessional for more information regarding\nany such payments or financial incentives his\nor her Intermediary firm may receive. Any\npayments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Fund or other Products.\n\nThe Fund may participate in certain market\nmaker incentive programs of a national\nsecurities exchange in which an affiliate\nof the Fund would pay a fee to the exchange\nused for the purpose of incentivizing one or\nmore market makers in the securities of the\nFund to enhance the liquidity and quality of\nthe secondary market of securities of the\nFund. The fee would then be\ncredited by the exchange to one or more market\nmakers that meet or exceed liquidity and\nmarket quality standards with respect to the\nsecurities of the Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee\npayments made to an exchange will be made by\nan affiliate of the Fund solely for the\nbenefit of the Fund and will not be paid from\nany Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA\nmay also participate in such programs.\n\nIf you have any questions, please call\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\n\niShares is a registered trademark of BlackRock\nFund Advisors and its affiliates.\n\nIS-A-SUPP-SAIS-0125\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT\n\nFOR FUTURE REFERENCE\n"
