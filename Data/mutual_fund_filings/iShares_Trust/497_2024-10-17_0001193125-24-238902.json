As a result, the last\nday of trading in the Fund on Cboe BZX\nExchange, Inc. (\u0093Cboe BZX\u0094) will be December\n16, 2024. Cboe BZX will suspend trading in the\nFund before the\nopen of trading on December 17, 2024, and\nshares of the Fund will no longer be available\nfor new investments as of this date. Proceeds\nof the liquidation are currently scheduled to\nbe sent to shareholders on December 19, 2024.\nThe\nFund\u0092s final net asset value, as calculated on\nDecember 16, 2024, will include any costs\nassociated with the liquidation expected to be\nborne by the Fund.\n\nBecause shares of the Fund will not be traded\non Cboe BZX during the period between December\n17, 2024 and December 19, 2024, we cannot\nassure you that there\nwill be a trading market for your shares.\nFurther, during this period, the Fund will be\nin the process of closing down and liquidating\nits portfolio, which may result in the Fund\nnot being able to track its Underlying Index\n(by December 17,\n2024, the Underlying Index value will be\nrepresented almost entirely by cash as no\nsecurities will remain in the Underlying\nIndex). After December 16, 2024, shareholders\nthat remain invested in the Fund will receive\nthe entire amount of their\npro rata share of the liquidation proceeds on\nor about December 19, 2024, subject to their\nbrokerage firm\u0092s processes.\n\nShareholders may sell their\nholdings of the Fund prior to December 17,\n2024 and may incur the usual and customary\nbrokerage commissions associated with the sale\nof Fund shares. If you still hold shares of\nthe Fund on December 19, 2024, the Fund will\nautomatically\nredeem your shares for cash based on the net\nasset value as of the close of business on\nDecember 16, 2024, which will include any\ndividends or distributions calculated as of\nthat date.\n\nIf you are subject to federal income tax, the\nliquidation of the Fund will result in one or\nmore taxable events for you. A sale or\nexchange of Fund shares prior to the\nliquidation will generally give rise to a\ncapital gain or loss to you for federal income\ntax purposes. In connection with the\nliquidation, the Fund may declare tax exempt\nor taxable distributions of its investment\nincome and/or taxable distributions\nof its net capital gain. Any liquidation\nproceeds paid to you should generally be\ntreated as received by you in exchange for\nyour shares and will therefore generally give\nrise to a capital gain or loss depending on\nyour tax basis. Please refer to\nthe \u0093Taxes\u0094 disclosure beginning on page 123\nof the SAI and consult your own tax advisor\n\nabout the potential tax consequences of the\nFund\u0092s liquidation, including any state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax consequences.\n\nIf you have any questions, please call\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\n\niShares is a registered trademark of BlackRock\nFund Advisors or its affiliates.\n\nIS-A-IBHD-1024\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT\n\nFOR FUTURE REFERENCE\n"
