Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.08%     None       0.00%       0.08%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $8          $26      $45      $103  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 67% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae Dividend Yield Focus Index\nSM (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which offers\nexposure to high quality U.S.-domiciled\ncompanies that have had strong financial\nhealth and an ability to sustain above average\ndividend payouts. The Underlying Index is a\nsubset of the Morningstar \u00ae US Market Index SM\n, a broad market index that represents\napproximately 97% of the market capitalization\nof publicly traded U.S. stocks. The Underlying\nIndex is composed of qualified income-paying\nsecurities that are screened for superior\ncompany quality and financial health as\ndetermined by Morningstar, Inc.'s ( \u201c\nMorningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index Provider \u201d )\nproprietary index methodology. Stocks in the\nUnderlying Index represent the top 75 high-\nyielding stocks meeting the screening\nrequirements. The Morningstar index\nmethodology determines \u201c company quality \u201d in\naccordance with the Morningstar Economic Moat\nTM rating system, in which companies are\nassigned a moat rating of \u201c none, \u201d \u201c narrow \u201d\nor \u201c wide \u201d based on the prospect of earning\nabove average returns on capital and the\nstrength of the company\u2019s competitive\nadvantage. Additionally, companies are\nscreened for \u201c financial health \u201d using\nMorningstar\u2019s Distance to Default measure, a\nquantitative option pricing approach that\nestimates a company\u2019s probability of default.\nTo qualify for inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex, constituents must have a Morningstar\nEconomic Moat rating of \u201c narrow \u201d or \u201c wide \u201d\nand have a Morningstar Distance to Default\nscore in the top 50% of eligible dividend-\npaying companies within their sector.\nCompanies that are not assigned a Morningstar\nEconomic Moat rating must have a Morningstar\nDistance to Default score in the top 30% of\neligible dividend-paying companies within\ntheir sector. Additionally, each constituent\u2019s\ndividend must be deemed to be qualified\nincome. S-1\n\nThe Underlying Index may include\nlarge-, mid-and small-capitalization companies\nand may change over time. As of April 30,\n2024, a significant portion of the Underlying\nIndex is represented by securities of\ncompanies in the energy, financials and\nutilities industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund\u2019s total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk . Investing in dividend-paying stocks\ninvolves the risk that such stocks may fall\nout of favor with investors and underperform\nother types of stocks or the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of the stocks held by the Fund will\nnot declare dividends in the future or will\nreduce or eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends), which may adversely affect the\nFund. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider S-2 or a third-\nparty data provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Energy Companies\nRisk. Companies in the energy sector may be\nadversely affected by volatility in energy and\ncommodity prices, lower demand,\noverproduction, depletion of resources, social\nand political unrest, war, trade disputes,\ngovernment regulations and energy transition\nefforts, among other factors. The energy\nsector is cyclical and can be significantly\nimpacted by changes in economic conditions.\nSome energy companies, such as those in the\noil and gas sector, face substantial costs\nrelated to exploration and production and\nsignificant operational risks. Energy\ncompanies are at risk of environmental damage\nclaims and other litigation. Financial\nCompanies Risk . Financial services companies\nare subject to extensive governmental\nregulation and intervention, which may\nadversely affect their profitability, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and liquid\nassets they must maintain and their size,\namong other things. Financial services\ncompanies also may be significantly affected\nby, among other things, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, volatility in financial\nmarkets, credit rating downgrades, adverse\npublic perception, exposure concentration and\ncounterparty risk. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Non-\nDiversification Risk . The Fund is classified\nas \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means that,\ncompared with funds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a greater\npercentage of its assets in securities or\nother instruments representing a small number\nof issuers or counterparties and thus may be\nmore susceptible to the risks associated with\nthese particular issuers or counterparties. As\na result, the Fund's performance may depend to\na greater extent on the performance S-3 of a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties,\nwhich may lead to more volatility in the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk . The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited\nto, human error, processing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders, counterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies, small-capitalization companies may\nbe less stable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of small-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge- or mid-capitalization stocks. Tracking\nError Risk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c\ntracking error, \u201d which is the divergence of\nthe Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Utility Companies Risk. The\nutilities sector is generally subject to\nsignificant government regulation and\noversight, including restrictions on rates as\nwell as environmental and other regulations.\nUtility companies also may face risks related\nto, among other things, natural disasters,\ncyber or other attacks, capital project\nfunding, energy price volatility and increased\ncompetition. S-4\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-5\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2011 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-6\n\niSHARES \u00ae ENVIRONMENTALLY AWARE REAL ESTATE\nETF Ticker: ERET Stock Exchange: Nasdaq\nInvestment Objective The iShares\nEnvironmentally Aware Real Estate ETF (the \u201c\nFund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment results\nof an index composed of developed market real\nestate equities while targeting increased\nexposure to green certification and energy\nefficiency relative to the parent index. Fees\nand Expenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the tables and examples\nbelow.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.30%     None       0.00%       0.30%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $31         $97     $169      $381  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 13% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Green Target\nIndex (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which was\ndeveloped by FTSE International Limited (the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d or \u201c FTSE \u201d ). The Underlying\nIndex is composed of securities selected from\nthe FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index (the \u201c\nParent Index \u201d ). The Parent Index is composed\nof real estate investment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d )\nand real estate holding and development\ncompanies from developed market countries or\nregions. The Underlying Index reweights\nconstituents of the Parent Index to target, in\naggregate, a minimum level of green\ncertification; an increase in green\ncertification and a reduction in energy usage,\nboth relative to the Parent Index; and a level\nof carbon emission intensity that is no worse\nthan that of the Parent Index, subject to\ncertain constraints. The Parent Index may\ninclude large-, mid- and small-capitalization\nconstituents. Green certification is defined\nas the share of total net leasable area owned\nand/or managed by a constituent that is\ncertified as part of an eligible green\ncertification program. To be eligible, a green\ncertification program must be transparent\nabout how the sustainability performance of\nassets is evaluated, including publicly\navailable methodology documentation; provide a\npublicly available list of certified assets;\nhave a robust certification procedure,\nincluding formal credentialization and data\nvalidation ( e.g ., no self-certification);\nand include coverage of at least three\nsustainability-related indicators, one of\nwhich must be energy performance. Energy usage\nis defined as the average modeled energy\nconsumption, measured in kilowatt hours per\nsquare meter, of net leasable area owned\nand/or managed by a constituent. The Index\nProvider estimates energy usage on a building-\nby-building basis using individual building\nspecifications ( e.g ., type, size, year of\nconstruction) and local market data ( e.g .,\nsources of thermal energy vs. electricity).\nThe model is regularly calibrated by\nincorporating actual energy consumption data.\nS-7\n\nCarbon emission intensity is defined as a\nconstituent\u2019s total Scope 1 and Scope 2\noperational emissions scaled by enterprise\nvalue including cash ( i.e ., the sum of\nmarket capitalization at fiscal year-end,\npreferred stock, minority interests, total\ndebt, and cash and cash equivalents). Scope 1\nemissions are direct greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG \u201d\n) emissions from sources that are controlled\nor owned by an organization. Scope 2 emissions\nare indirect GHG emissions associated with the\norganization\u2019s purchase of energy. The Index\nProvider estimates the carbon footprint for a\nbuilding using modeled energy consumption data\ncombined with national and/or sub-national\ndata on the carbon intensity of the local\nutility grid and energy mix. The Index\nProvider begins with the Parent Index and\nexcludes the securities of issuers that it\nidentifies as being involved in the business\nof tobacco, companies involved with\ncontroversial weapons, producers and retailers\nof civilian firearms, and companies involved\nin thermal coal mining, thermal coal-based\npower generation or the extraction of oil\nsands. Certain exclusions ( e.g .,\ncontroversial weapons or manufacturing tobacco\nproducts) are categorical, and others are\nbased on percentage of revenue or ownership\nthresholds. Additionally, the Index Provider\nexcludes companies that it determines are\ninvolved in controversies related to the ten\nUnited Nations Global Compact ( \u201c UNGC \u201d )\nprinciples, which are classified into four\ncategories: human rights, labor, environment\nand anti-corruption. The Index Provider then\nweights the remaining securities to target, in\naggregate across the Underlying Index, (i) a\nminimum of 10% green certification; (ii) a 30%\nincrease in green certification relative to\nthe Parent Index; (iii) a 10% reduction in\nenergy usage relative to the Parent Index; and\n(iv) a level of carbon emission intensity that\nis no worse than that of the Parent Index. The\nUnderlying Index must have a beta (a measure\nof volatility relative to the overall market)\nbetween 0.7 and 1.3 relative to the Parent\nIndex, using daily returns over the past two\nyears. In addition, the Underlying Index's\ncountry and sector exposure must be within 2%\nof the Parent Index weight. The minimum weight\nfor an individual constituent is 0.005% of the\nUnderlying Index, and the maximum weight is\nthe lesser of 10% of the Underlying Index or\n10 times the constituent\u2019s weight in the\nParent Index. At each index review, the sector\nand country constraints and the green\ncertification and energy usage targets may be\nrelaxed if it is infeasible to achieve all\nconstraints and targets. The Underlying Index\nwill be reviewed and reconstituted in\nDecember, with the business involvement and\nUNGC controversy screens applied quarterly. As\nof April 30, 2024, the Underlying Index was\ncomposed of 356 securities of companies in the\nfollowing countries or regions: Australia,\nAustria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Japan,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, the United Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d\n), and the U.S. As of April 30, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index\nincluded companies offering various real\nestate services, real estate operating\ncompanies and REITs. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 90% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e. ,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby FTSE, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, S-8 including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s investment in developed country issuers\nwill subject the Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries tend to\nrepresent a significant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed countries have\nexperienced security concerns, such as war,\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a country\u2019s or\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities.\nEnvironmentally Aware Real Estate Investment\nStrategy Risk. The Fund\u2019s investment strategy\nof tracking an Underlying Index that uses\nenvironmental factors related to real estate (\ne.g ., green certification and energy\nefficiency) may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse environmental factors related to real\nestate or other funds that use similar\ncriteria. Companies that own or manage real\nestate assets with favorable environmental\nfactors are exposed to risks specific to the\nreal estate market as well as the risks that\nare associated specifically with the\nenvironmental factors related to real estate.\nThe issuers of securities selected for the\nUnderlying Index may not be the same issuers\nselected by other index providers that use\ncertain environmental factors with respect to\nreal estate companies. The issuers of\nsecurities selected for the Underlying Index\nmay have real estate assets that do not\nexhibit favorable environmental performance.\nIn addition, issuers selected for the\nUnderlying Index may not later display\npositive or favorable environmental\nperformance metrics. Real Estate Companies\nRisk. Real estate companies, which include\nreal estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"), real\nestate holding and operating companies, and\nreal estate management or development\ncompanies, expose investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly as well as to the\nrisks from the way that such companies\noperate. Real estate is highly sensitive to\ngeneral and local economic conditions and can\nbe subject to intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Other real estate risks include\ndecreases in property values, tax increases,\nzoning changes, casualty or condemnation\nlosses, environmental liabilities, regulatory\nlimitations on rent or eviction, and defaults\nby borrowers or tenants. Real estate companies\nmay be heavily invested in one geographic\nregion, industry or property type. They also\nmay be highly leveraged, which can magnify\nlosses, and interest rate increases can make\nit difficult to obtain financing and service\ndebt. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Assets Under Management (AUM)\nRisk . From time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below in Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk ), a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, or another\nfund may invest in the Fund and hold its\ninvestment for a specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such entity would\nnot redeem its investment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at such levels,\nwhich could negatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk. An\n\u201c Authorized Participant \u201d is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof creation units ( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only\nan Authorized Participant S-9 may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof the non-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or\nif there are delays or limits on the\nrepatriation of foreign currency. Currency\nexchange rates can be very volatile and can\nchange quickly and unpredictably. As a result,\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and without\nwarning. In addition, the Fund may incur costs\nin connection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Dividend-Paying\nStock Risk . Investing in dividend-paying\nstocks involves the risk that such stocks may\nfall out of favor with investors and\nunderperform other types of stocks or the\nbroader market. Companies that issue dividend-\npaying stocks are not required to pay or\ncontinue paying dividends on such stocks. It\nis possible that issuers of the stocks held by\nthe Fund will not declare dividends in the\nfuture or will reduce or eliminate the payment\nof dividends (including reducing or\neliminating anticipated accelerations or\nincreases in the payment of dividends), which\nmay adversely affect the Fund. ESG Risk. To\nthe extent that the Underlying Index uses\ncriteria related to the ESG characteristics of\nissuers, this may limit the types and number\nof investment opportunities available to the\nFund and, as a result, the Fund may\nunderperform other funds whose underlying\nindex does not use ESG criteria. The\nUnderlying Index\u2019s use of ESG criteria may\nresult in the Fund investing in, or allocating\ngreater weight to, securities or market\nsectors that underperform the market as a\nwhole or underperform other funds that use ESG\ncriteria. In addition, the use of\nrepresentative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Issuer Risk . The performance of\nthe Fund depends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other assets to which\nthe Fund has exposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty. Large\nShareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.\nCertain shareholders of the Fund, including an\nAuthorized Participant, a third-party\ninvestor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an affiliate of\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, a market maker, or another\nentity, may from time to time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares, or may hold\ntheir investment in the Fund for a limited\nperiod of time. There can be no assurance that\nany large shareholder or large group of\nshareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares could require the Fund to dispose\nof assets to meet the redemption requests,\nwhich can accelerate the realization of\ntaxable income and/or capital gains and cause\nthe Fund to make taxable distributions to its\nshareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under certain\ncircumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may\nbe treated as receiving a disproportionately\nlarge taxable distribution during or with\nrespect to such year. In some circumstances,\nthe Fund may hold a relatively large\nproportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor S-10 sell Fund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a discount to NAV, you may\npay significantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the underlying value\nof the Fund shares. National Closed Market\nTrading Risk. To the extent that securities or\nother assets held by the Fund trade on foreign\nexchanges or in foreign markets that may be\nclosed when the securities exchange on which\nthe Fund\u2019s shares trade is open, there are\nlikely to be deviations between such asset\u2019s\ncurrent price and its last quoted price ( i.e\n., the quote from the closed foreign market to\nthe Fund). The impact of a closed foreign\nmarket on the Fund is likely to be greater\nwhere a large portion of the Fund\u2019s holdings\ntrade on a closed foreign market or when a\nforeign market is closed for unscheduled\nreasons. These deviations could result in\npremiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that\nmay be greater than those experienced by other\nfunds. Non-Diversification Risk . The Fund is\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means\nthat, compared with funds that are classified\nas \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a\ngreater percentage of its assets in securities\nor other instruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties and thus\nmay be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of Investing in the\nU.S . Investing in U.S. issuers subjects the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic risks that\nare specific to the U.S. Certain changes in\nthe U.S., such as a weakening of the U.S.\neconomy or a decline in its financial markets,\nmay have an adverse effect on U.S. issuers.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may engage\nin securities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small Fund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted\nif it does not meet certain requirements set\nby the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could lead to elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its shareholders.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Valuation Risk . The price\nthat the Fund could receive upon the sale (or\nother disposition) of a security or other\nasset may differ from the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe security or other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or that are valued\nusing a fair value methodology. The price\nreceived by the Fund also may differ from the\nvalue used by the Underlying Index. In\naddition, the value of the securities or other\nassets in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when investors are\nnot able to purchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that create or redeem\nFund shares on days when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or lower or\nhigher redemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\nassets not been fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology. The ability to\nvalue investments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. S-11\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-12\n\nManagement Investment Adviser.

Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2022. Purchase and\nSale of Fund Shares The Fund is an ETF.\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an\nindividual retirement account ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in\nwhich case, your distributions generally will\nbe taxed when withdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase shares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems or other services related to\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-13\n\niSHARES \u00ae GLOBAL CLEAN ENERGY ETF Ticker: ICLN\nStock Exchange: Nasdaq Investment Objective\nThe iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (the \u201c\nFund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment results\nof an index composed of global equities in the\nclean energy sector. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.41%     None       0.00%       0.41%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $42        $132     $230      $518  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 42% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe S&P Global Clean Energy Index TM (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which is designed to\ntrack the performance of approximately 100\nclean energy-related companies. The Underlying\nIndex is a subset of the S&P Global Broad\nMarket Index and includes stocks traded on\ndeveloped and emerging market exchanges which\nmeet or exceed, at the time of inclusion, $300\nmillion in total market capitalization, $100\nmillion in float- adjusted market\ncapitalization, and $3 million median daily\nvalue traded over a six-month period (or $2\nmillion for existing constituents). S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d )\nuses Global Industry Classification Standard (\n\u201c GICS \u201d ) and FactSet\u2019s Revere Business\nIndustry Classification System ( \u201c RBICS \u201d )\nclassifications along with Trucost Power\nGeneration Data ( \u201c Trucost \u201d ) for utility\ncompanies to determine the eligible universe.\nCompanies that derive at least 25% in\naggregate revenue from clean energy related\nbusinesses as defined by RBICS data, companies\nin the Electric Utilities, Multi-Utilities, or\nIndependent Power Producers & Energy Traders\nsub-industries that generate at least 20% of\ntheir power from renewable sources as measured\nby Trucost data, and companies in the GICS \u201c\nrenewable utilities \u201d sub-industry form the\npreliminary universe. In addition, the Index\nProvider uses company exclusion criteria\nrelated to business activity ( e.g. ,\ncontroversial weapons, tobacco, thermal coal,\netc.) and other exclusion guidelines based on\na company\u2019s compliance with the United Nations\nGlobal Compact ( \u201c UNGC \u201d ) provided by\nSustainalytics. Effective with the index\nreview in October 2024, the Index Provider\nwill utilize measurements from S&P Global\nBusiness Involvement Screens when monitoring\nthe company exclusion criteria related to\nbusiness activity (e.g., controversial\nweapons, tobacco, thermal coal, etc.). Lastly,\nthe Index Provider uses RepRisk, a leading\nprovider of business intelligence on\nenvironmental, social, and governance risks,\nfor screening and S-14\n\nanalysis of controversies related to companies\nwithin the index. Companies without coverage\nare ineligible for index inclusion until they\nreceive such coverage. The Index Provider\ndefines clean energy exposure scores ( \u201c\nexposure scores \u201d ) for each company based on\nits primary business. The Index Provider also\ncalculates carbon-to-revenue footprint\nstandards and excludes those companies with a\nhigh carbon-to-revenue footprint standard\nscore determined by the Index Provider. All\nremaining companies with a high exposure score\nare selected for the Underlying Index. If the\nUnderlying Index does not have 100\nconstituents, companies with lower exposure\nscores are selected, based on market-\ncapitalization, until a constituent count of\n100 is reached. If, after a constituent count\nof 100 is reached, the weighted average\nexposure score is lower than certain\nthresholds, companies with low exposure scores\nwill be removed from the Underlying Index.\nTherefore, while the Underlying Index targets\na constituent count of 100 securities, it may\nbe comprised of greater or fewer than 100\nsecurities. As of April 30, 2024, there were\n100 constituents in the Underlying Index.\nConstituents are weighted based on a product\nof the constituent\u2019s float-adjusted market\ncapitalization and exposure score, with\nweights of constituents capped based on their\nexposure score and liquidity weight. The Index\nProvider determines liquidity weight based on\nthe relative six-month median daily value of a\nsecurity compared to that measure for the\noverall index. In addition, the cumulative\nweight of all stocks within the Underlying\nIndex that have a weight greater than 4.5%\ncannot exceed 40%. As of April 30, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index comprised securities of\ncompanies in the following countries or\nregions: Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile,\nChina, Denmark, France, Germany, India,\nIndonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand,\nNorway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain,\nSwitzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, and the U.S. The\nUnderlying Index may include large-, mid- or\nsmall-capitalization companies. As of April\n30, 2024, a significant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the industrials, technology\nand utilities industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is a product\nof the Index Provider, which is independent of\nthe Fund and BFA. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition and relative\nweightings of the securities in the Underlying\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully.\nClean Energy Companies Risk . Clean energy\ncompanies may be highly dependent on\ngovernment subsidies, contracts with\ngovernment entities, and the successful\ndevelopment of new and proprietary\ntechnologies. Seasonal weather conditions,\nfluctuations in the supply of and demand for\nclean energy products, changes in energy\nprices, and political events may cause\nfluctuations in the performance of clean\nenergy companies and the prices of their\nsecurities. S-15 Equity Securities Risk .\nEquity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue, and their values may be more volatile\nthan those of other asset classes. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of\nreasons that may directly relate to the issuer\nas well as due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Custody Risk .\nLess developed securities markets are more\nlikely to experience problems with the\nclearing and settlement of trades, as well as\nthe custody of securities and other assets by\nlocal banks, agents and depositories. These\nissues may have an adverse impact on the Fund,\nincluding losses or delays in payments,\ndelivery or recovery of money or other assets.\nCybersecurity Risk . Failures or breaches of\nthe electronic systems of the Fund, its\nadviser, distributor, Index Provider, other\nservice providers, counterparties, or issuers\nof assets in which the Fund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively impact the Fund\nand its shareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems. The\nFund cannot control the cybersecurity plans\nand systems of its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. In addition, cyber\nincidents may adversely impact the issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund invests, which\nmay cause such investments to lose value. ESG\nRisk. To the extent that the Underlying Index\nuses criteria related to the ESG\ncharacteristics of issuers, this may limit the\ntypes and number of investment opportunities\navailable to the Fund and, as a result, the\nFund may underperform other funds whose\nunderlying index does not use ESG criteria.\nThe Underlying Index\u2019s use of ESG criteria may\nresult in the Fund investing in, or allocating\ngreater weight to, securities or market\nsectors that underperform the market as a\nwhole or underperform other funds that use ESG\ncriteria. In addition, the use of\nrepresentative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Industrial Companies Risk.\nIndustrial companies face a number of risks,\nincluding supply chain and distribution\ndisruptions, business interruptions, product\nobsolescence, third-party vendor risks, cyber\nattacks, trade disputes, product recalls,\nliability claims, scarcity of materials or\nparts, excess capacity, changes in consumer\npreferences, and volatility in commodity\nprices and currencies. The performance of such\ncompanies may also be S-16 affected by\ntechnological developments, labor relations,\nlegislative and regulatory changes, government\nspending policies, and changes in domestic and\ninternational economies. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Non-Diversification Risk . The\nFund is classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d\nThis means that, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk and European Economic Risk . Operational\nRisk . The Fund is exposed to operational\nrisks arising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u2019s service providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through controls and\nprocedures. However, these measures do not\nS-17 address every possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant operational\nrisks. Reliance on Trading Partners Risk . The\nFund invests in countries or regions whose\neconomies are heavily dependent upon trading\nwith key partners. Any reduction in this\ntrading may have an adverse impact on the\nFund's investments. Through its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers, the Fund is\nspecifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk,\nEuropean Economic Risk and U.S. Economic Risk\n. Risk of Investing in China . Investments in\nChinese securities, including certain Hong\nKong-listed and U.S.-listed securities,\nsubject the Fund to risks specific to China.\nChina may be subject to considerable degrees\nof economic, political and social instability.\nChina is an emerging market and demonstrates\nsignificantly higher volatility from time to\ntime in comparison to developed markets. Over\nthe last few decades, the Chinese government\nhas undertaken reform of economic and market\npractices and has expanded the sphere of\nprivate ownership of property in China.\nHowever, Chinese markets generally continue to\nexperience inefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies resulting from governmental\ninfluence, a lack of publicly available\ninformation and/or political and social\ninstability. Chinese companies are also\nsubject to the risk that Chinese authorities\ncan intervene in their operations and\nstructure. Internal social unrest or\nconfrontations with neighboring countries,\nincluding military conflicts in response to\nsuch events, may also disrupt economic\ndevelopment in China and result in a greater\nrisk of currency fluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate fluctuations and\nhigher rates of inflation. China has\nexperienced security concerns, such as\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Additionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-sponsored\ncyberattacks against foreign companies and\nforeign governments. Actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity and strained\ninternational relations, including purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. Incidents involving China's or\nthe region's security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and the Fund's investments.\nExport growth continues to be a major driver\nof China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in\nspending on Chinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification, institution of\nadditional tariffs or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions or a trade war between China and the\nU.S. or in response to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any\nof the economies of China's key trading\npartners may have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy. The Underlying Index may\ninclude companies that are subject to economic\nor trade restrictions (but not investment\nrestrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national security, human\nrights or other concerns of such government.\nSo long as these restrictions do not include\nrestrictions on investments, the Fund is\ngenerally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the Underlying Index.\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Fund invests\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they do not meet\nU.S. accounting standards and auditor\noversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund does not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. Risk of Investing\nin Developed Countries . The Fund\u2019s investment\nin developed country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and have\ngenerally experienced slower economic growth\nthan some less developed countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nIn addition, developed countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to the economic\nconditions of certain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price\nor availability of certain commodities. Risk\nof Investing in Emerging Markets . Investments\nin emerging market issuers may be subject to a\ngreater risk of loss than investments in\nissuers located or operating in more developed\nmarkets. Emerging markets may be more likely\nto experience inflation, social instability,\npolitical turmoil or rapid changes in economic\nconditions than more developed markets.\nCompanies in many emerging markets are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries, and as a result, information about\nthe securities in which the Fund invests may\nbe less reliable or complete. Emerging markets\noften have less reliable securities valuations\nand greater risk associated with custody of\nsecurities than developed markets. There may\nbe significant obstacles to obtaining\ninformation necessary for investigations into\nor litigation against companies and\nshareholders may have limited legal remedies.\nThe Fund does not select investments based on\ninvestor protection considerations. Risk of\nInvesting in Saudi Arabia . Investing in Saudi\nArabian issuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to Saudi\nArabia. The economy of Saudi Arabia is\ndominated by petroleum exports. A sustained\ndecrease in petroleum prices could have a\nnegative impact on all aspects of the economy.\nInvestments in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers involve risks not typically associated\nwith investments in securities of issuers in\nmore developed countries, which may negatively\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s investments.\nSuch heightened risks may include, among\nothers, the expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets, restrictions on and\ngovernment intervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict, crime and instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic S-18 and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Instability in the\nMiddle East region could adversely impact the\neconomy of Saudi Arabia, and there is no\nassurance of political stability in Saudi\nArabia. The ability of foreign investors to\ninvest in the securities of Saudi Arabian\ncompanies could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership of such securities. There\nare a number of ways to conduct transactions\nin equity securities in the Saudi Arabian\nmarket. The Fund generally expects to transact\nin a manner so that it is not limited by Saudi\nArabian regulations to a single broker.\nHowever, there may be a limited number of\nbrokers who can provide services to the Fund,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the\nprices, quantity or timing of Fund\ntransactions. Risk of Investing in the U.S .\nInvesting in U.S. issuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that are specific\nto the U.S. Certain changes in the U.S., such\nas a weakening of the U.S. economy or a\ndecline in its financial markets, may have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Semiconductor Companies Risk . The\nsemiconductor industry is characterized by\nrapid technological change and product\nobsolescence, cyclical market patterns, price\nerosion, periods of over-capacity and\nproduction shortages, variations in\nmanufacturing costs and yields, and\nsignificant expenditures for capital equipment\nand product development. Semiconductor\ncompanies depend significantly on third-party\nsuppliers and the availability of raw\nmaterials and may be adversely affected by\nsupply chain disruptions. They also may be\nadversely affected by the loss or impairment\nof intellectual property rights. Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk . Compared to\nmid- and large-capitalization companies,\nsmall-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of small-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge- or mid-capitalization stocks.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Thematic Investing\nRisk. The Fund relies on the Index Provider to\nidentify securities that reflect the relevant\nthemes and sub-themes for inclusion in the\nUnderlying Index. There is no guarantee that\nthe Underlying Index or the Fund will reflect\nthe intended theme and sub-theme exposures.\nThe Fund\u2019s performance may suffer if such\nsecurities are not correctly identified, if a\ntheme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected\nmanner, or if securities in the Underlying\nIndex do not benefit from the development of a\ntheme or sub-theme. The Fund\u2019s performance may\nalso be impacted if securities that are not\nrelated to the theme or sub-theme are included\nin the Underlying Index. Tracking Error Risk .\nThe Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d\nwhich is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. ETFs that track indexes\nwith significant exposure to emerging markets\nmay experience higher tracking error than ETFs\nthat do not track such indexes. Utility\nCompanies Risk. The utilities sector is\ngenerally subject to significant government\nregulation and oversight, including\nrestrictions on rates as well as environmental\nand other regulations. Utility companies also\nmay face risks related to, among other things,\nnatural disasters, cyber or other attacks,\ncapital project funding, energy price\nvolatility and increased competition.\nValuation Risk . The price that the Fund could\nreceive upon the sale (or other disposition)\nof a security or other asset may differ from\nthe Fund\u2019s valuation of the security or other\nasset, particularly for securities or other\nassets that trade in low volume or volatile\nmarkets or that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by the Fund\nalso may differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized\nParticipants that create or redeem Fund shares\non days when the Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may receive fewer\nor more shares, or lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have received had\nthe securities or other assets not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-19\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-20\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares\nof the Fund may only be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (a premium) or less\nthan NAV (a discount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the difference between\nthe highest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when buying or\nselling shares in the secondary market (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax Information The Fund\nintends to make distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\ndeferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or\nan IRA, in which case, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when withdrawn.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-21\n\niSHARES \u00ae GLOBAL REIT ETF Ticker: REET Stock\nExchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective The\niShares Global REIT ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks\nto track the investment results of an index\ncomposed of global real estate equities in\ndeveloped and emerging markets. Fees and\nExpenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the tables and examples\nbelow.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.14%     None       0.00%       0.14%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $14         $45      $79      $179  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 6% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe FTSE EPRA Nareit Global REITs Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which is designed to\ntrack the performance of publicly listed real\nestate investment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ) (or\ntheir local equivalents) in both developed and\nemerging markets. The index components must\nqualify for REIT (or its local equivalent)\nstatus in their country of domicile and meet\ncertain liquidity, size, and earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(EBITDA) requirements. Components are adjusted\nfor free float and foreign ownership limits.\nAs of April 30, 2024, the Underlying Index was\ncomposed of securities of companies in the\nfollowing countries or regions: Australia,\nBelgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong\nKong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan,\nLuxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands,\nNew Zealand, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia,\nSingapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,\nThailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom (the \u201c\nU.K. \u201d ) and the U.S. As of April 30, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by REITs. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. S-22\n\nBFA uses a representative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c Representative\nsampling \u201d is an indexing strategy that\ninvolves investing in a representative sample\nof securities that collectively has an\ninvestment profile similar to that of an\napplicable underlying index. The securities\nselected are expected to have, in the\naggregate, investment characteristics (based\non factors such as market capitalization and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return variability\nand yield) and liquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying index. The\nFund may or may not hold all of the securities\nin the Underlying Index. The Fund generally\nwill invest at least 80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of its Underlying Index\nand in investments that have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially\nidentical to the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index ( i.e. , depositary receipts\nrepresenting securities of the Underlying\nIndex) and may invest up to 20% of its assets\nin certain futures, options and swap\ncontracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates ( \u201c BlackRock Cash\nFunds \u201d ), as well as in securities not\nincluded in the Underlying Index, but which\nBFA believes will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part of that\nposition for the purposes of calculating the\npercentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby FTSE International Limited ( \u201c FTSE \u201d or\nthe \u201c Index Provider \u201d ), which is independent\nof the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition and relative\nweightings of the securities in the Underlying\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Real\nEstate Companies Risk. Real estate companies,\nwhich include real estate investment trusts\n(\"REITs\"), real estate holding and operating\ncompanies, and real estate management or\ndevelopment companies, expose investors to the\nrisks of owning real estate directly as well\nas to the risks from the way that such\ncompanies operate. Real estate is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and can be subject to intense\ncompetition and periodic overbuilding. Other\nreal estate risks include decreases in\nproperty values, tax increases, zoning\nchanges, casualty or condemnation losses,\nenvironmental liabilities, regulatory\nlimitations on rent or eviction, and defaults\nby borrowers or tenants. Real estate companies\nmay be heavily invested in one geographic\nregion, industry or property type. They also\nmay be highly leveraged, which can magnify\nlosses, and interest rate increases can make\nit difficult to obtain financing and service\ndebt. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. S-23 Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Dividend-Paying\nStock Risk . Investing in dividend-paying\nstocks involves the risk that such stocks may\nfall out of favor with investors and\nunderperform other types of stocks or the\nbroader market. Companies that issue dividend-\npaying stocks are not required to pay or\ncontinue paying dividends on such stocks. It\nis possible that issuers of the stocks held by\nthe Fund will not declare dividends in the\nfuture or will reduce or eliminate the payment\nof dividends (including reducing or\neliminating anticipated accelerations or\nincreases in the payment of dividends), which\nmay adversely affect the Fund. Issuer Risk .\nThe performance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large Shareholder and\nLarge-Scale Redemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders of the Fund, including an\nAuthorized Participant, a third-party\ninvestor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an affiliate of\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, a market maker, or another\nentity, may from time to time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares, or may hold\ntheir investment in the Fund for a limited\nperiod of time. There can be no assurance that\nany large shareholder or large group of\nshareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares could require the Fund to dispose\nof assets to meet the redemption requests,\nwhich can accelerate the realization of\ntaxable income and/or capital gains and cause\nthe Fund to make taxable distributions to its\nshareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under certain\ncircumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may\nbe treated as receiving a disproportionately\nlarge taxable distribution during or with\nrespect to such year. In some circumstances,\nthe Fund may hold a relatively large\nproportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. National Closed Market Trading Risk.\nTo the extent that securities or other assets\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or\nin foreign markets that may be closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrade is open, there are likely to be\ndeviations between such asset\u2019s current price\nand its last quoted price ( i.e ., the quote\nfrom the closed foreign market to the Fund).\nThe impact of a closed foreign market on the\nFund is likely to be greater where a large\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a foreign market\nis closed for unscheduled reasons. These S-24\ndeviations could result in premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that may be\ngreater than those experienced by other funds.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Securities issued\nby non-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of Investing in\nDeveloped Countries . The Fund\u2019s investment in\ndeveloped country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and have\ngenerally experienced slower economic growth\nthan some less developed countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u2019s or region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and may adversely\naffect its economy and the Fund\u2019s investments.\nIn addition, developed countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to the economic\nconditions of certain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price\nor availability of certain commodities. Risk\nof Investing in Saudi Arabia . Investing in\nSaudi Arabian issuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that are specific\nto Saudi Arabia. The economy of Saudi Arabia\nis dominated by petroleum exports. A sustained\ndecrease in petroleum prices could have a\nnegative impact on all aspects of the economy.\nInvestments in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers involve risks not typically associated\nwith investments in securities of issuers in\nmore developed countries, which may negatively\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s investments.\nSuch heightened risks may include, among\nothers, the expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets, restrictions on and\ngovernment intervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict, crime and instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Instability in the\nMiddle East region could adversely impact the\neconomy of Saudi Arabia, and there is no\nassurance of political stability in Saudi\nArabia. The ability of foreign investors to\ninvest in the securities of Saudi Arabian\ncompanies could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership of such securities. There\nare a number of ways to conduct transactions\nin equity securities in the Saudi Arabian\nmarket. The Fund generally expects to transact\nin a manner so that it is not limited by Saudi\nArabian regulations to a single broker.\nHowever, there may be a limited number of\nbrokers who can provide services to the Fund,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the\nprices, quantity or timing of Fund\ntransactions. Risk of Investing in the U.S .\nInvesting in U.S. issuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that are specific\nto the U.S. Certain changes in the U.S., such\nas a weakening of the U.S. economy or a\ndecline in its financial markets, may have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Valuation Risk . The price\nthat the Fund could receive upon the sale (or\nother disposition) of a security or other\nasset may differ from the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe security or other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or that are valued\nusing a fair value methodology. The price\nreceived by the Fund also may differ from the\nvalue used by the Underlying Index. In\naddition, the value of the securities or other\nassets in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when investors are\nnot able to purchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that create or redeem\nFund shares on days when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or lower or\nhigher redemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\nassets not been fair S-25 valued or been\nvalued using a different methodology. The\nability to value investments may be impacted\nby technological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. S-26\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-27\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2014, 2014 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares\nof the Fund may only be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (a premium) or less\nthan NAV (a discount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the difference between\nthe highest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when buying or\nselling shares in the secondary market (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax Information The Fund\nintends to make distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\ndeferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or\nan IRA, in which case, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when withdrawn.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-28\n\niSHARES \u00ae INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPED REAL ESTATE\nETF Ticker: IFGL Stock Exchange: Nasdaq\nInvestment Objective The iShares International\nDeveloped Real Estate ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d )\nseeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of real estate equities in\ndeveloped non-U.S. markets. Fees and Expenses\nThe following table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026             Total       \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExp\u2026  AnnualFun\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.48%     None       0.06%      0.54%       \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. Example. This\nExample is intended to help you compare the\ncost of owning shares of the Fund with the\ncost of investing in other funds. The Example\nassumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of those\nperiods. The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses remain the same.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $55        $173     $302      $677  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 13% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed ex US Index\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which measures\nthe performance of companies engaged in the\nownership, trading and development of income-\nproducing real estate in the developed real\nestate markets (except for the U.S.) as\ndefined by FTSE EPRA Nareit. As of April 30,\n2024, the Underlying Index was composed of\nsecurities of companies in the following\ncountries or regions: Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany,\nHong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland and the United Kingdom (the \u201c U.K.\n\u201d ). As of April 30, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index includes\ncompanies offering various real estate\nservices, real estate operating companies and\nreal estate investment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ).\nThe components of the Underlying Index are\nlikely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected S-29\n\nto have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e. ,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates ( \u201c BlackRock Cash\nFunds \u201d ), as well as in securities not\nincluded in the Underlying Index, but which\nBFA believes will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part of that\nposition for the purposes of calculating the\npercentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby FTSE International Limited (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c FTSE \u201d ), which is independent\nof the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition and relative\nweightings of the securities in the Underlying\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s investment in developed country issuers\nwill subject the Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries tend to\nrepresent a significant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed countries have\nexperienced security concerns, such as war,\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a country\u2019s or\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities. Real\nEstate Companies Risk. Real estate companies,\nwhich include real estate investment trusts\n(\"REITs\"), real estate holding and operating\ncompanies, and real estate management or\ndevelopment companies, expose investors to the\nrisks of owning real estate directly as well\nas to the risks from the way that such\ncompanies operate. Real estate is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and can be subject to intense\ncompetition and periodic overbuilding. Other\nreal estate risks include decreases in\nproperty values, tax increases, zoning\nchanges, casualty or condemnation losses,\nenvironmental liabilities, regulatory\nlimitations on rent or eviction, and defaults\nby borrowers or tenants. Real estate companies\nmay be heavily invested in one geographic\nregion, industry or property type. They also\nmay be highly leveraged, which can magnify\nlosses, and interest rate increases can make\nit difficult to obtain financing and service\ndebt. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse S-30 impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S.\ndollars, the NAV could decline if the currency\nof a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Dividend-Paying\nStock Risk . Investing in dividend-paying\nstocks involves the risk that such stocks may\nfall out of favor with investors and\nunderperform other types of stocks or the\nbroader market. Companies that issue dividend-\npaying stocks are not required to pay or\ncontinue paying dividends on such stocks. It\nis possible that issuers of the stocks held by\nthe Fund will not declare dividends in the\nfuture or will reduce or eliminate the payment\nof dividends (including reducing or\neliminating anticipated accelerations or\nincreases in the payment of dividends), which\nmay adversely affect the Fund. Issuer Risk .\nThe performance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large Shareholder and\nLarge-Scale Redemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders of the Fund, including an\nAuthorized Participant, a third-party\ninvestor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an affiliate of\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, a market maker, or another\nentity, may from time to time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares, or may hold\ntheir investment in the Fund for a limited\nperiod of time. There can be no assurance that\nany large shareholder or large group of\nshareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares could require the Fund to dispose\nof assets to meet the redemption requests,\nwhich can accelerate the realization of\ntaxable income and/or capital gains and cause\nthe Fund to make taxable distributions to its\nshareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under certain\ncircumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may\nbe treated as receiving a disproportionately\nlarge taxable distribution during or with\nrespect to such year. In some circumstances,\nthe Fund may hold a relatively large\nproportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. S-31 National Closed Market Trading\nRisk. To the extent that securities or other\nassets held by the Fund trade on foreign\nexchanges or in foreign markets that may be\nclosed when the securities exchange on which\nthe Fund\u2019s shares trade is open, there are\nlikely to be deviations between such asset\u2019s\ncurrent price and its last quoted price ( i.e\n., the quote from the closed foreign market to\nthe Fund). The impact of a closed foreign\nmarket on the Fund is likely to be greater\nwhere a large portion of the Fund\u2019s holdings\ntrade on a closed foreign market or when a\nforeign market is closed for unscheduled\nreasons. These deviations could result in\npremiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that\nmay be greater than those experienced by other\nfunds. Non-U.S. Securities Risk . Securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers (including\ndepositary receipts) are subject to different\nlegal, regulatory, political, economic, and\nmarket risks than securities issued by U.S.\nissuers. These risks include greater market\nvolatility, less market liquidity, higher\ntransaction costs, expropriation, confiscatory\ntaxation, adverse changes in foreign\ninvestment or currency control regulations,\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital,\nand political instability. Non-U.S. issuers\nmay be subject to different accounting, audit\nand financial reporting standards than U.S.\nissuers, and there may be less publicly\navailable information about non-U.S. issuers.\nForeign market trading hours, different\nclearing and settlement procedures, and\nholiday schedules may limit the Fund's ability\nto engage in portfolio transactions. To the\nextent that investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. The Fund is specifically exposed to\nAsian Economic Risk and European Economic Risk\n. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of Investing in Japan\n. Investing in Japanese issuers subjects the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic risks that\nare specific to Japan. In addition, Japan is\nsubject to the risk of natural disasters, such\nas earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons\nand tsunamis, which could negatively affect\nthe Fund. Japan\u2019s relations with its neighbors\nhave at times been strained, which could\nadversely affect the Japanese markets and\neconomy. Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may\nengage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a decline in the\nvalue of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. Tracking Error Risk\n. The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking error,\n\u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Valuation Risk . The price\nthat the Fund could receive upon the sale (or\nother disposition) of a security or other\nasset may differ from the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe security or other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or that are valued\nusing a fair value methodology. The price\nreceived by the Fund also may differ from the\nvalue used by the Underlying Index. In\naddition, the value of the securities or other\nassets in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when investors are\nnot able to purchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that create or redeem\nFund shares on days when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or lower or\nhigher redemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\nassets not been fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology. The ability to\nvalue investments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-33\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares\nof the Fund may only be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (a premium) or less\nthan NAV (a discount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the difference between\nthe highest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when buying or\nselling shares in the secondary market (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax Information The Fund\nintends to make distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\ndeferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or\nan IRA, in which case, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when withdrawn.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-34\n\niSHARES \u00ae INTERNATIONAL SELECT DIVIDEND ETF\nTicker: IDV Stock Exchange: Cboe BZX\nInvestment Objective The iShares International\nSelect Dividend ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to\ntrack the investment results of an index\ncomposed of relatively high dividend paying\nequities in non-U.S. developed markets. Fees\nand Expenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $50        $157     $274      $616  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 48% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Dow Jones EPAC Select Dividend Index (the\n\u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which is provided by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c SPDJI \u201d ). The Underlying\nIndex measures the performance of 100 high\ndividend-paying companies in the EPAC (Europe,\nPacific, Asia and Canada) region, which covers\ndeveloped markets excluding the U.S.\nConstituents are selected according to\nindicated annual dividend ( \u201c IAD \u201d ) yield,\nsubject to screening criteria and weighting\nconstraints. IAD yield is defined as a stock\u2019s\nIAD (not including any special dividends)\ndivided by its price. The starting universe\nfor the Underlying Index is the S&P EPAC BMI\nand the S&P Canada BMI indexes, excluding real\nestate investment trusts. To be eligible for\nthe Underlying Index as a new constituent, an\nissuer must (i) have paid dividends in each of\nthe previous three years; (ii) have a current\nyear trailing 12-month dividend-per-share\nratio that is greater than or equal to its\nthree-year average dividend-per-share ratio;\nand (iii) have a five-year average dividend\ncoverage ratio that is greater than or equal\nto two-thirds of the five-year average\ndividend coverage ratio of the corresponding\nS&P BMI country index, or greater than 118%,\nwhichever is greater. In addition, the\nsecurity must have (x) a non-negative trailing\n12-month earnings per share; (y) a float-\nadjusted market capitalization of at least $1\nbillion, or at least $750 million for current\nconstituents; and (z) a three-month average\ndaily trading value of at least $3 million.\nCurrent constituents are included in the\neligible universe regardless of their dividend\ngrowth rate, coverage ratio, current year\nearnings per share or average daily trading\nvalue. To select the 100 constituents, the\nIndex Provider ranks the eligible securities\nby IAD yield and first includes all existing\nconstituents that are ranked in the top 200\nand then selects non-constituent stocks in\nrank order until the count reaches 100. S-35\n\nThe Underlying Index is reconstituted annually\nwith constituent weights determined based on\ntilted IAD yield, which is calculated by\nmultiplying the constituent\u2019s IAD yield\n(capped at 20%) by the square root of its fair\nmarket capitalization. The weight of\nindividual securities is capped at the lower\nof 10% or five times the constituent\u2019s fair\nmarket capitalization weight within the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, there is a 30%\ncap on the aggregate weight of constituents\nwithin each Global Industry Classification\nStandard sector and each country of domicile.\nThe Underlying Index is reviewed daily based\non each constituent\u2019s weight. Daily capping is\nperformed if the aggregate weight of\nconstituents with an individual weight greater\nthan 4.8% exceeds 24% of the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s total weight. If that threshold is\nbreached, the current constituent weights are\nrecapped, with the weights of individual\nconstituents capped at 10% and the aggregate\nweight of constituents with an individual\nweight greater than 4.5% capped at 22.5% of\nthe Underlying Index\u2019s total weight. IAD\nyields and tilted yield weights are not\nrecalculated if the capping thresholds are\nbreached throughout the year. A freeze period\non the daily capping is implemented during the\nannual index reconstitution. As of April 30,\n2024, the Underlying Index was composed of\nsecurities of companies in the following\ncountries or regions: Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea,\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United\nKingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ). The Fund invests in\nnon-U.S. securities, which may in some cases\nnot produce qualifying dividend income. The\nUnderlying Index includes large, mid and\nsmall-capitalization companies and may change\nover time. As of April 30, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the consumer\ngoods, financials, and utilities industries or\nsectors. The components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over time. BFA uses\nan indexing approach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund does not try to\n\u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index ( i.e. ,\ndepositary receipts representing securities of\nthe Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates ( \u201c BlackRock Cash\nFunds \u201d ), as well as in securities not\nincluded in the Underlying Index, but which\nBFA believes will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part of that\nposition for the purposes of calculating the\npercentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby SPDJI, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s investment in developed country issuers\nwill subject the Fund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries tend to\nrepresent a significant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed countries have\nexperienced security concerns, such as war,\nterrorism and strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a country\u2019s or\nregion\u2019s security may cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be adversely impacted\nby changes to the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading S-36 partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities. Dividend-\nPaying Stock Risk . Investing in dividend-\npaying stocks involves the risk that such\nstocks may fall out of favor with investors\nand underperform other types of stocks or the\nbroader market. Companies that issue dividend-\npaying stocks are not required to pay or\ncontinue paying dividends on such stocks. It\nis possible that issuers of the stocks held by\nthe Fund will not declare dividends in the\nfuture or will reduce or eliminate the payment\nof dividends (including reducing or\neliminating anticipated accelerations or\nincreases in the payment of dividends), which\nmay adversely affect the Fund. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Consumer goods and\nservices companies ( \u201c consumer companies \u201d )\nface risks related to changes in consumer\npreferences and disposable income, commodity\nprices, government regulation, supply chain\ndisruptions, damage to brand or reputation,\neconomic slowdown and labor shortages, among\nother things. Currency Risk . Because the\nFund\u2019s NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the\nNAV could decline if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the repatriation\nof foreign currency. Currency exchange rates\ncan be very volatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result, the Fund\u2019s NAV\nmay change quickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions between U.S.\ndollars and foreign currencies. Cybersecurity\nRisk . Failures or breaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,\nIndex Provider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIssuer Risk . The performance of the Fund\ndepends on the performance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to which the Fund\nhas exposure. The value of securities or other\nassets may S-37 decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of the\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares could require the\nFund to dispose of assets to meet the\nredemption requests, which can accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively\nlarge proportion of its assets in cash in\nanticipation of large redemptions, diluting\nits investment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities or other assets when it\nmight not otherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of Fund shares.\nManagement Risk . The Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index and may hold securities\nor other assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. National Closed Market Trading Risk.\nTo the extent that securities or other assets\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or\nin foreign markets that may be closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrade is open, there are likely to be\ndeviations between such asset\u2019s current price\nand its last quoted price ( i.e ., the quote\nfrom the closed foreign market to the Fund).\nThe impact of a closed foreign market on the\nFund is likely to be greater where a large\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a foreign market\nis closed for unscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV that may be\ngreater than those experienced by other funds.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Securities issued\nby non-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include greater market volatility,\nless market liquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation, confiscatory taxation,\nadverse changes in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations, restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject\nto different accounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S. issuers, and\nthere may be less publicly available\ninformation about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different clearing and\nsettlement procedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions. To the extent that\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. The\nFund is specifically exposed to European\nEconomic Risk . Operational Risk . The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited\nto, human error, processing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders, counterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk . The Fund invests in\ncountries or regions whose economies are\nheavily dependent upon trading with key\npartners. Any reduction in this trading may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund's\ninvestments. Through its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers, the Fund is\nspecifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk,\nEuropean Economic Risk and U.S. Economic Risk\n. Risk of Investing in the U.K. Investing in\nU.K. issuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.K.\nThe U.K. has one of the largest economies in\nEurope, and the U.S. and other European\ncountries are substantial trading partners of\nthe U.K. As a result, the U.K.\u2019s economy may\nbe impacted by changes to the economic\ncondition of the U.S. and other European\ncountries. On January 31, 2020, the U.K.\nofficially left the European Union (the \u201c EU \u201d\n) ( \u201c Brexit \u201d ), subject to a transitional\nperiod that ended December 31, 2020. The U.K.\nand EU have reached an agreement on the terms\nof their future trading relationship effective\nJanuary 1, 2021, which principally relates to\nthe trading of goods rather than services,\nincluding financial services. Further\ndiscussions are to be held between the U.K.\nand the EU in relation to matters not covered\nby the trade agreement, such as financial\nservices. The Fund faces risks associated with\nthe potential uncertainty and S-38\nconsequences that may follow Brexit, including\nwith respect to volatility in exchange rates\nand interest rates. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Utility Companies Risk. The\nutilities sector is generally subject to\nsignificant government regulation and\noversight, including restrictions on rates as\nwell as environmental and other regulations.\nUtility companies also may face risks related\nto, among other things, natural disasters,\ncyber or other attacks, capital project\nfunding, energy price volatility and increased\ncompetition. Valuation Risk . The price that\nthe Fund could receive upon the sale (or other\ndisposition) of a security or other asset may\ndiffer from the Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nsecurity or other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or that are valued\nusing a fair value methodology. The price\nreceived by the Fund also may differ from the\nvalue used by the Underlying Index. In\naddition, the value of the securities or other\nassets in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when investors are\nnot able to purchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that create or redeem\nFund shares on days when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or lower or\nhigher redemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\nassets not been fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology. The ability to\nvalue investments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. S-39\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-40\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares\nof the Fund may only be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at market prices\nrather than at NAV, shares may trade at a\nprice greater than NAV (a premium) or less\nthan NAV (a discount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the difference between\nthe highest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when buying or\nselling shares in the secondary market (the \u201c\nbid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax Information The Fund\nintends to make distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\ndeferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or\nan IRA, in which case, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when withdrawn.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-41\n\niSHARES \u00ae SELECT DIVIDEND ETF Ticker: DVY\nStock Exchange: Nasdaq Investment Objective\nThe iShares Select Dividend ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d\n) seeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of relatively high dividend\npaying U.S. equities. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.38%     None       0.00%       0.38%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $39        $122     $213      $480  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 17% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index (the\n\u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which measures the\nperformance of the U.S.'s leading stocks by\ndividend yield. Dividend yield is calculated\nusing a stock's indicated annual dividend (not\nincluding any special dividends) divided by\nits price. The Underlying Index is composed of\n100 of the highest dividend-yielding\nsecurities (excluding real estate investment\ntrusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d )) in the Dow Jones U.S.\nIndex, a broad-based index representative of\nthe total market for U.S. equity securities.\nTo be included in the Underlying Index, each\nsecurity (i) must have a dividend per share\ngreater than or equal to its five-year average\ndividend per share; (ii) must have a five-year\naverage dividend coverage ratio of greater\nthan or equal to 167%; (iii) must have a\nthree-month average daily trading volume of\n200,000 shares (100,000 shares for current\nconstituents); (iv) must have paid dividends\nin each of the previous five years; (v) must\nhave a non-negative trailing 12 month earnings\nper share; and (vi) must have a float-adjusted\nmarket cap of at least $3 billion ($2 billion\nfor current constituents). The Underlying\nIndex is reviewed quarterly and rebalanced\nannually. The Underlying Index includes\nlarge-, mid- and small-capitalization\ncompanies and may change over time. As of\nApril 30, 2024, a significant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the consumer goods, financials\nand utilities industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. S-42\n\nIndexing may eliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially outperform the\nUnderlying Index but also may reduce some of\nthe risks of active management, such as poor\nsecurity selection. Indexing seeks to achieve\nlower costs and better after-tax performance\nby aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund\u2019s total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c SPDJI \u201d ), which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and publishes information\nregarding the market value of the Underlying\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk . Investing in dividend-paying stocks\ninvolves the risk that such stocks may fall\nout of favor with investors and underperform\nother types of stocks or the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of the stocks held by the Fund will\nnot declare dividends in the future or will\nreduce or eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends), which may adversely affect the\nFund. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency S-43 registered with the SEC,\nwhich has a written agreement with the Fund or\none of its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Consumer goods and\nservices companies ( \u201c consumer companies \u201d )\nface risks related to changes in consumer\npreferences and disposable income, commodity\nprices, government regulation, supply chain\ndisruptions, damage to brand or reputation,\neconomic slowdown and labor shortages, among\nother things. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIssuer Risk . The performance of the Fund\ndepends on the performance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to which the Fund\nhas exposure. The value of securities or other\nassets may decline, or perform differently\nfrom the market as a whole, due to changes in\nthe financial condition or credit rating of\nthe issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies, small-capitalization companies may\nbe less stable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of small-\ncapitalization companies S-44 may be more\nvolatile and less liquid than those of mid-\nand large-capitalization companies. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s share price may be more\nvolatile than that of a fund with a greater\ninvestment in large- or mid-capitalization\nstocks. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Utility Companies Risk. The\nutilities sector is generally subject to\nsignificant government regulation and\noversight, including restrictions on rates as\nwell as environmental and other regulations.\nUtility companies also may face risks related\nto, among other things, natural disasters,\ncyber or other attacks, capital project\nfunding, energy price volatility and increased\ncompetition. S-45\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-46\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund.

Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-47\n\nMore Information About the Funds This\nProspectus contains important information\nabout investing in the Funds that are listed\nbelow.

                                         \nETFs are funds that trade like other publicly\ntraded securities. Shares of each Fund are\nlisted on a national securities exchange and\ntrade in the secondary market at market prices\nthat change throughout the day. The market\nprice for a share of a Fund may be different\nfrom the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. Each Fund\ninvests in a particular segment of the markets\nfor securities and other instruments (as\napplicable) and is designed to be used as part\nof broader asset allocation strategies.\nAccordingly, an investment in a Fund should\nnot constitute a complete investment program.\nAn investment in a Fund is not a bank deposit,\nand it is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, any\nother government agency, BFA or any of BFA\u2019s\naffiliates. Index Funds A share of a Fund\nrepresents an ownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of securities and other\ninstruments (as applicable) that is intended\nto track the Fund\u2019s Underlying Index. An index\nis a financial calculation, based on a\ngrouping of financial instruments, and is not\nan investment product, while each Fund is an\nactual investment portfolio. The performance\nof a Fund and that of its Underlying Index may\nvary for a number of reasons, including\ntransaction costs, asset or currency\nvaluations, corporate actions, timing\nvariances and differences between the\ncomposition of a Fund\u2019s portfolio and that of\nthe Underlying Index resulting from the Fund\u2019s\nuse of representative sampling or from legal\nrestrictions (such as diversification\nrequirements) that apply to the Fund but not\nto its Underlying Index. From time to time,\nthe provider of the Underlying Index ( \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ) may make changes to the index\nmethodology or other adjustments to a Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index. Unless otherwise determined\nby BFA, any such change will be reflected in\nthe calculation of the Underlying Index\u2019s\nperformance on a going-forward basis after the\neffective date of such change. Therefore, the\nperformance of the Underlying Index that is\nshown for periods prior to the effective date\nof any such change generally will not be\nrecalculated or restated to reflect the\nchange. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Funds. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of the applicable underlying index.\nBecause the Funds use representative sampling,\nthey can be expected to have a larger tracking\nerror than if they used a replication indexing\nstrategy. \u201c Replication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests in\nsubstantially all of the securities in its\nunderlying index in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying index.\n\n1\n\nBorrowing Each Fund listed below may borrow as\na temporary measure for extraordinary or\nemergency purposes, including to meet\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. Each Fund\ndoes not intend to borrow money in order to\nleverage its portfolio. iShares\nEnvironmentally Aware Real Estate ETF\niShares Global Clean Energy ETF\niShares International Select Dividend ETF\nEuropean Union Disclosure The Fund listed\nbelow has not been categorized under the\nEuropean Union ( \u201c EU \u201d ) sustainable finance\ndisclosure regulation ( \u201c SFDR \u201d ) as an \u201c\nArticle 8 \u201d or \u201c Article 9 \u201d product. In\naddition, the Fund\u2019s investment strategy does\nnot take into account the criteria for\nenvironmentally sustainable economic\nactivities under the EU sustainable investment\ntaxonomy regulation or principal adverse\nimpacts ( \u201c PAIs \u201d ) on sustainability factors\nunder the SFDR. PAIs are identified under the\nSFDR as the material impacts of investment\ndecisions on sustainability factors relating\nto environmental, social and employee matters,\nrespect for human rights, and anti-corruption\nand anti-bribery matters. iShares Select\nDividend ETF 2\n\nAdditional Information About the Funds' Risks\nEach Fund is subject to various risks, any of\nwhich may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV,\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Each Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. You could lose all or part of\nyour investment in a Fund, which could\nunderperform other investments. The table\nbelow identifies the principal and other (non-\nprincipal) risks that apply to each Fund. A\nFund that invests in an Underlying Fund also\nmay be indirectly exposed to these risks\nthrough such investment.

\nAsian Economic Risk. Certain Asian economies\nhave experienced rapid growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, but there\nis no assurance that this growth rate will be\nmaintained. Other Asian economies, however,\nhave experienced high inflation, high\nunemployment, currency devaluations and\nrestrictions, and over-extension of credit.\nGeopolitical hostility, political instability,\nand economic or environmental events in any\none Asian country may have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire Asian region, as\nwell as on major trading partners outside\nAsia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets\nmay have a significant adverse effect on some\nor all of the economies of the countries in\nwhich a Fund invests. In particular, China is\na key trading partner of many Asian countries\nand any changes in trading relationships\nbetween China and other Asian countries may\naffect the region as a whole. Many Asian\ncountries are subject to political risk,\nincluding political instability, corruption\nand regional conflict with neighboring\ncountries. North Korea and South Korea each\nhave substantial military capabilities, and\nhistorical tensions between the two countries\npresent the risk of war. Escalated tensions\ninvolving the two countries and any outbreak\nof hostilities between the two countries, or\neven the threat of an outbreak of hostilities,\ncould have a severe adverse effect on the\nentire Asian region. Certain Asian countries\nhave developed increasingly strained\nrelationships with the U.S. or with China, and\nif these relations were to worsen, they could\nadversely affect Asian issuers that rely on\nthe U.S. or China for trade. In addition, many\nAsian countries are subject to social and\nlabor risks associated with demands for\nimproved political, economic and social\nconditions. These risks, among others, may\nadversely affect the value of the investments.\nAsset Class Risk. The securities and other\nassets in a Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to indexes that track, or assets\nthat represent, other countries or geographic\nunits, industries, markets, market segments,\nor asset classes. Various types of securities,\nother assets and indexes may experience cycles\nof outperformance and underperformance in\ncomparison to financial markets generally.\nThis divergence may be due to a number of\nfactors including, among other things,\ninflation, interest rates, productivity,\nglobal demand for local products or resources,\nand regulation and governmental controls. This\nmay cause a Fund to underperform other\ninvestment vehicles that invest in different\nasset classes. Assets Under Management (AUM)\nRisk. From time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant, a third-party investor, a Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of a Fund\u2019s adviser, or\nanother fund may invest in a Fund and hold its\ninvestment for a specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such entity would\nnot redeem its investment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at such levels,\nwhich could negatively impact the Fund.\nAustralasian Economic Risk. The economies of\nAustralasia, which include Australia and New\nZealand, depend on exports from the energy,\nagricultural and mining sectors and, as a\nresult, are susceptible to fluctuations in the\ncommodity markets. These economies also\nincreasingly depend on their growing service\nindustries. The Australasian economies depend\non the economies of their key trading\npartners, which include China, Japan, South\nKorea, the U.S. and certain European\ncountries. Reduced spending by any of these\ntrading partners on Australasian products and\nservices, or negative changes in any of these\neconomies, may have an adverse impact on some\nor all of the Australasian economies. Economic\nevents in key trading countries can have a\nsignificant effect on the Australasian\neconomies. Other risks to Australasian\ncountries include natural disasters that may\noccur in the region (e.g., droughts,\nearthquakes, fires, tsunamis) and national or\nregional security concerns (e.g., terrorism,\nwar, strained international relations). Any\nsuch event may adversely affect the\nAustralasian economies, financial markets or\nissuers of securities, causing an adverse\nimpact on the value of a Fund\u2019s investments.\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk.\nOnly an Authorized Participant may engage in\ncreation or redemption transactions directly\nwith a Fund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for a Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk may be\nheightened for a Fund that invests in\nsecurities issued by non-U.S. issuers or\ninstruments with lower\n\n6\n\ntrading volume. Such assets often entail\ngreater settlement and operational complexity\nand higher capital costs for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the number of\nAuthorized Participants that engage with the\nFund. Borrowing Risk. Borrowing may exaggerate\nchanges in a Fund\u2019s NAV and in the return on\nits portfolio. A Fund that borrows will incur\ninterest expenses and other fees, which may\nreduce the Fund\u2019s return. Borrowing may also\ncause a Fund to liquidate positions when it\nmay not be advantageous to do so to satisfy\nits obligations. Central and South American\nEconomic Risk. Certain Central and South\nAmerican countries have experienced high\ninterest rates, economic volatility, high\nlevels of inflation, currency devaluations,\nregime changes, government defaults and high\nunemployment rates. Additionally, commodities\nsuch as oil and gas, minerals and metals\nrepresent a significant percentage of the\nregion\u2019s exports, and the economies of\ncountries in the region are particularly\nsensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices\nas a result. Central and South American\ncountries depend on the economies of their key\ntrading partners, which include China, the\nU.S., other countries in the region and\ncertain European countries. Reduced spending\nby any of these trading partners on products\nand services, or negative changes in any of\nthese economies, may have an adverse impact on\nsome or all of the economies in the region.\nThe impact of any of the foregoing events in\none country could have a significant effect on\nthe entire region. Other risks to Central and\nSouth American countries include natural\ndisasters that may occur in the region (e.g.,\nfloods, hurricanes, earthquakes) and national\nor regional security concerns (e.g.,\nterrorism, war, strained international\nrelations). Any such event may adversely\naffect Central and South American economies,\nfinancial markets or issuers of securities,\ncausing an adverse impact on the value of a\nFund\u2019s investments. Clean Energy Companies\nRisk. Many clean energy companies are involved\nin the development and commercialization of\nnew technologies, which may be subject to\ndelays due to budget constraints and\ntechnological difficulties. Clean energy\ncompanies may be highly dependent on\ngovernment subsidies and contracts with\ngovernment entities. Clean energy companies\nmay depend on the successful development of\nnew and proprietary technologies. Seasonal\nweather conditions, fluctuations in the supply\nof and demand for clean energy products,\nchanges in energy prices, and political events\nmay cause fluctuations in the performance of\nclean energy companies and the prices of their\nsecurities. Close-Out Risk for Qualified\nFinancial Contracts. Regulations adopted by\nglobal prudential regulators require\ncounterparties that are part of U.S. or\nforeign global systemically important banking\norganizations to include contractual\nrestrictions on close-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified financial\ncontracts. Qualified financial contracts\ninclude agreements relating to swaps, currency\nforwards and other derivatives as well as\nrepurchase agreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions prevent a Fund\nfrom closing out a qualified financial\ncontract during a specified time period if the\ncounterparty is subject to resolution\nproceedings and also prohibit a Fund from\nexercising default rights due to a\nreceivership or similar proceeding of an\naffiliate of the counterparty. These\nrequirements may increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. Concentration Risk. A\nFund may be susceptible to an increased risk\nof loss, including losses due to adverse\nevents that affect the Fund\u2019s investments more\nthan the market as a whole, to the extent that\nthe Fund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. A Fund with investment concentration\nmay be more adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets, may\nexperience greater price volatility and may be\nmore susceptible to adverse economic, market,\npolitical or regulatory impacts on those\nassets compared to a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments. Consumer Goods\nand Services Companies Risk. Many consumer\ngoods and services companies ( \u201c consumer\ncompanies \u201d ) rely heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending and may\nbe impacted by social trends, marketing\ncampaigns, demographic shifts and other\nfactors affecting consumer preferences and\ndemand. In addition, damage to a brand or a\nreputation crisis can have a substantial\nadverse impact on consumer companies. Certain\nconsumer companies, such as those providing\nmore discretionary goods or services, may\ndepend more on business cycles, overall\neconomic conditions and consumer confidence.\nMany consumer goods and services are subject\nto government regulation and the related\ncompliance costs, and consumer companies also\nface the risk of product liability claims.\nConsumer companies also may be adversely\naffected by volatility in commodity prices,\nsupply chain disruptions and labor shortages.\nCurrency Risk. Because each Fund\u2019s NAV is\ndetermined on the basis of the U.S. dollar,\ninvestors may lose money if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which a Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on repatriation of\nforeign currency, even if the foreign currency\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s holdings in that market\nincreases. Currency exchange rates can be very\nvolatile and can change quickly and\nunpredictably. As a result, a Fund\u2019s NAV may\nchange quickly and without warning. In\naddition, a Fund may incur costs in connection\nwith conversions between U.S. dollars and\nforeign currencies. Custody Risk. Custody risk\nrefers to the risks in the process of clearing\nand settling trades, as well as the holding of\nsecurities and other assets by local banks,\nagents and depositories. These risks are\nheightened in jurisdictions with less\ndeveloped markets or less robust settlement\nand custody infrastructure and processes, and\nthey may result in losses or delays in\npayments, delivery or recovery of money or\nother assets. Low trading volumes and volatile\nprices in less developed markets may make\ntrades harder to complete and settle.\nGovernments or trade groups may compel local\nagents to hold securities and other assets in\ndesignated depositories that may not be\nsubject to independent evaluation. Local\nagents are held only to the standards of care\nof their local markets. In general, the less\ndeveloped a country\u2019s securities markets are,\nthe higher the degree of custody risk. 7\nCybersecurity Risk. A Fund and entities that\ninteract with the Fund are susceptible to\noperational, information security and related\ncybersecurity risks, both directly and through\ntheir service providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to, a Fund\u2019s\nadviser, distributor, other service providers\n( e.g ., index and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer agents and\nadministrators), counterparties, market\nmakers, Authorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market operators,\nand governmental authorities. Cybersecurity\nrisks are also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in which a Fund\ninvests, which could result in material\nadverse consequences for such issuers and may\ncause the Fund\u2019s investment in such issuers to\nlose value. Cyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or unintentional events.\nThey include, but are not limited to, gaining\nunauthorized access to systems,\nmisappropriating assets or sensitive\ninformation, corrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational disruption.\nGeopolitical tensions may increase the scale\nand sophistication of deliberate attacks,\nparticularly those from nation-states or from\nentities with nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions\nand impact business operations and may result\nin any of the following: financial losses,\ninterference with a Fund\u2019s ability to\ncalculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to trading,\nsubmission of erroneous trades or erroneous\ncreation or redemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service providers to transact\nbusiness, violations of applicable privacy and\nother laws, regulatory fines, penalties,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other legal and\ncompliance expenses. In addition, cyber\nincidents may render records of Fund assets\nand transactions, shareholder ownership of\nFund shares, and other data integral to a\nFund\u2019s functioning inaccessible, inaccurate or\nincomplete. A Fund may incur substantial costs\nin order to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. Each Fund has established business\ncontinuity plans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent, cyber\nincidents. However, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that prevention and\nremediation efforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go undetected.\nFurthermore, a Fund cannot control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and other third\nparties whose activities affect the Fund. A\nFund and its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk. Investing in dividend-paying stocks\ninvolves the risk that such stocks may fall\nout of favor with investors and underperform\nother types of stocks or the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of dividend-paying stocks will not\ndeclare dividends in the future or will reduce\nor eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends), which may adversely affect a Fund\nwith such holdings. In addition, the value of\ndividend-paying stocks can decline when\ninterest rates rise, as fixed-income\ninvestments become more attractive to\ninvestors. Energy Companies Risk. The energy\nsector tends to be closely tied to the\neconomic cycle and can be significantly\naffected by supply-demand dynamics and\nvolatility in commodity prices. Energy\ncompanies also may be adversely affected by\nexchange rate fluctuations, war or other\nconflicts, sanctions, import/export controls,\ndepletion of resources, technological advances\nand labor relations. This sector generally is\nsubject to substantial government regulation,\nand companies may incur significant costs in\ncomplying with environmental and other laws.\nPolicies that promote energy conservation,\nclean energy or the transition to low carbon\nalternatives also may affect the performance\nof energy companies. Energy companies may\ndepend on a relatively small number of\ncustomers, including governmental entities and\nutilities. The exploration and production of\nenergy sources and the development of energy\ninfrastructure often require significant\ncapital expenditures, and companies may face\nhigh interest costs and difficulty in raising\ncapital. Energy companies also may face\nchallenges from operating in countries with a\nhistory of adverse policies or events, such as\nexpropriation, confiscation of assets,\ncorruption, political instability and social\nunrest. The operations of energy companies may\nbe disrupted by events that target or damage\nenergy infrastructure, including cyber or\nother attacks, accidents and natural\ndisasters. Energy companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. The energy sector may\nexperience significant market volatility. For\nexample, Russia's large-scale invasion of\nUkraine in 2022 led to disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nimposed various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. It is impossible to predict the\neffect of current or future sanctions and\nrestrictions, the extent and duration of the\nconflict, and associated disruptions in the\nenergy sector. The effect of these events or\nany related developments could be significant\nand may have a severe adverse effect on a\nFund's performance. Environmentally Aware Real\nEstate Investment Strategy Risk. An investment\nstrategy of tracking an Underlying Index that\nuses environmental factors related to real\nestate ( e.g ., green certification and energy\nefficiency) may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to a Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse environmental factors related to real\nestate or other funds that use similar\ncriteria. Companies that own or manage real\nestate assets with 8 favorable environmental\nfactors are exposed to risks specific to the\nreal estate market as well as the risks that\nare associated specifically with the\nenvironmental factors related to real estate.\nThese companies may be affected by unique\nsupply and demand factors that do not apply to\nother real estate sectors, such as changes in\ndemand for energy efficient technology and\nmaterials. Such companies could also face\nrisks related to the effort associated with\nsecuring and maintaining third-party green\ncertifications. These companies may be\nconcentrated in a particular country or\nregion, and any adverse event affecting one of\nthese countries or regions could have a\nnegative impact on the environmental\nperformance related to real estate. The value\nof the securities selected for such an\nUnderlying Index may be affected by legal and\nregulatory developments applicable to the\nenvironmental factors related to real estate.\nThe issuers of securities selected for the\nUnderlying Index may not be the same issuers\nselected by other index providers that use\ncertain environmental factors with respect to\nreal estate companies. The issuers of\nsecurities selected for the Underlying Index\nmay have real estate assets that do not\nexhibit favorable environmental performance.\nIn addition, issuers selected for the\nUnderlying Index may not later display\npositive or favorable environmental\nperformance metrics. Equity Securities Risk.\nEquity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue due to general market or economic\nconditions, perceptions about the markets in\nwhich issuers participate or a number of\nfactors relating to a specific issuer.\nInvestments in equity securities may be more\nvolatile than investments in other asset\nclasses. Equity securities (both common and\npreferred stock) are subordinated to debt\nsecurities in a company\u2019s capital structure,\nand so equity holders are generally subject to\nmore risks, particularly in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Common stock has the\nlowest priority and the greatest risks,\nincluding with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments. ESG Risk. To the extent\nthat a Fund\u2019s Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. An Underlying Index\u2019s use of\nESG criteria may result in a Fund investing\nin, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\ndivergence of a Fund's overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider to such\nUnderlying Index evaluates securities for\ninclusion and/or weighting in the Underlying\nIndex based on ESG criteria and data provided\nby the Index Provider or third parties. The\nIndex Provider\u2019s evaluation of securities\u2019 ESG\ncharacteristics depends on these criteria and\ndata, which may vary by index provider, and no\nassurance can be given that they will be\ncomplete, accurate or current. In addition, an\nIndex Provider may evaluate security-level ESG\ndata (including ratings) and, if applicable,\nESG objectives or constraints that are\nrelevant to the Underlying Index only at index\nreviews or rebalances. Securities included in\nthe Underlying Index may cease to meet the\nrelevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless\nremain in the Underlying Index and in the Fund\nusing the Underlying Index until the next\nreview or rebalance by the Index Provider. As\na result, certain securities in the Underlying\nIndex, or the Underlying Index as a whole, may\nnot meet the relevant ESG objectives or\nconstraints at all times. If the ESG\nassessment of a security in the Underlying\nIndex or a Fund changes, neither the Fund nor\nBFA accepts any liability in relation to such\nchange. BFA does not monitor securities in the\nUnderlying Index with respect to ESG\nobjectives or constraints applied by the Index\nProvider and is not responsible for changes to\nthe ESG assessment of a security in the\nUnderlying Index between rebalances. In\naddition, BFA does not assess the validity of\nan Index Provider\u2019s evaluation of the ESG\ncharacteristics of securities or the criteria\nand data used in such evaluation. The impacts\nof risks related to ESG investing are likely\nto change over time, and new ESG risks may be\nidentified as further data and information\nregarding ESG factors and impacts become\navailable. In addition, methodologies for ESG\ninvesting continue to develop, and the ESG\nmethodology applied by an Index Provider may\nchange over time. European Economic Risk. The\nEconomic and Monetary Union (the \u201c eurozone \u201d\n) of the requires compliance by member states\nthat are members of the eurozone with\nrestrictions on inflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates and debt levels, as well as\nfiscal and monetary controls, each of which\nmay significantly affect every country in\nEurope, including those countries that are not\nmembers of the eurozone. Additionally,\nEuropean countries outside of the eurozone may\npresent economic risks that are independent of\nthe indirect effects that eurozone policies\nhave on them. In particular, the economy may\nbe affected by global economic, industrial and\nfinancial shifts. Changes in imports or\nexports, changes in governmental or EU\nregulations on trade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro (the common currency of\neurozone countries), the default or threat of\ndefault by an EU member state on its sovereign\ndebt and/or an economic recession in an EU\nmember state may have a significant adverse\neffect on the economies of other EU member\nstates and their trading partners. The\nEuropean financial markets have historically\nexperienced volatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic downturns or\ngovernment debt levels in several European\ncountries, including, but not limited to,\nAustria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.\nThese events have affected and may in the\nfuture adversely affect the exchange rate of\nthe euro and may significantly affect European\ncountries. Responses to financial problems by\nEuropean governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the desired results,\nmay result in social unrest, may limit future\ngrowth and economic recovery or may have other\nunintended consequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and other\nentities of their debt could have additional\nadverse effects on economies, financial\nmarkets and asset valuations around the world.\nIn addition, one or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K.\nleft the EU ( \u201c Brexit \u201d ) on January 31,\n2020. Brexit could adversely affect European\nor worldwide political, regulatory, economic\nor market conditions and could contribute to\ninstability in global political institutions,\nregulatory agencies and financial markets. The\nnational politics of countries in Europe have\nbeen unpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding, for example, secessionist\nmovements. The governments of European\ncountries may be subject to change and such\ncountries may experience social and political\nunrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or\nsocial developments may result in sudden and\nsignificant 9 investment losses. The\noccurrence of terrorist incidents throughout\nEurope or war in the region could also impact\nfinancial markets. The impact of these events\nis not clear but could be significant and far-\nreaching. Russian Invasion of Ukraine . Russia\nlaunched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on\nFebruary 24, 2022. The extent and duration of\nthe military action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich a Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally.\nFinancial Companies Risk. Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation and intervention,\nwhich may change frequently and may adversely\naffect their profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions, credit\nrating downgrades, adverse public perception\nand exposure concentration. Increased risk-\ntaking by financial companies may result in\ngreater overall risk in the global financial\nsector. Certain events may cause an unusually\nhigh degree of volatility in financial markets\nand pose the risk of large losses for\nfinancial services companies. Financial\ncompanies frequently operate with substantial\nfinancial leverage and are exposed directly to\nthe credit risk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, which also may be leveraged to\nan unknown degree. Financial companies may\nhave significant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties; as a result, a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother financial companies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk may result in\nsignificant negative impacts to companies with\ndirect exposure to the defaulting counterparty\nas well as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financial sector generally.\nGeographic and Security Risks. Issuers in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio may be located in, or\notherwise connected to, parts of the world\naffected by natural disasters, such as severe\nheat, earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic\neruptions, wildfires, droughts, floods,\nhurricanes and tsunamis. In addition, issuers\nmay be impacted by security concerns with\nrespect to a country or region, such as war\nand other types of conflict, terrorism,\nstrained international relations and\nterritorial disputes. Any of these events may\nadversely affect the issuers, markets and\neconomies to which a Fund is exposed, which\nmay adversely affect the value of the Fund.\nHealthcare Companies Risk. The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by the following factors, among\nothers: extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, a\nlimited number of products, labor shortages,\nsupply chain issues and industry innovation.\nMany new products in the healthcare sector\nentail significant research and development\nand require regulatory approval, all of which\nmay be long and costly, and such efforts\nultimately may be unsuccessful. Many\nhealthcare companies depend heavily on\nobtaining and defending patents, which can be\ncostly, and may be adversely affected by the\nexpiration of patents. Healthcare companies\nalso are subject to extensive litigation based\non product liability and similar claims.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. A Fund may not\nacquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, a Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nLiquid investments may become illiquid after\npurchase by a Fund, particularly during\nperiods of market turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or instrument that\nis deemed to be liquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long as it is\nheld by a Fund, and any security or instrument\nheld by a Fund may be deemed an illiquid\ninvestment pursuant to a Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent a Fund holds\nilliquid investments, the illiquid investments\nmay reduce the returns of a Fund because a\nFund may be unable to transact at advantageous\ntimes or prices. An investment may be illiquid\ndue to, among other things, the reduced number\nand capacity of traditional market\nparticipants to make a market in securities or\ninstruments or the lack of an active market\nfor such securities or instruments, capital\ncontrols, delays or limits on repatriation of\nlocal currency, or insolvency of local\ngovernments. To the extent that a Fund invests\nin securities or instruments with substantial\nmarket and/or credit risk, a Fund will tend to\nhave increased exposure to the risks\nassociated with illiquid investments. Illiquid\ninvestments may be harder to value, especially\nin changing markets. a Fund is forced to sell\nunderlying investments at reduced prices or\nunder unfavorable conditions to meet\nredemption requests or for other cash needs, a\nFund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified\nin a rising interest rate environment or other\ncircumstances where redemptions from a Fund\nmay be greater than normal. Other market\nparticipants may be attempting to liquidate\nholdings at the same time as a Fund, causing\nincreased supply of a Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments in the market and contributing to\nilliquid investments risk and downward pricing\npressure. In addition, if a Fund is limited in\nits ability to sell illiquid investments\nduring periods when shareholders are redeeming\ntheir shares, a Fund will need to sell liquid\nsecurities to meet redemption requests and\nilliquid securities will become a larger\nportion of a Fund\u2019s holdings. During periods\nof market volatility, liquidity in the market\nfor a Fund\u2019s shares may be impacted by the\nliquidity in the market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by a Fund,\nwhich could lead to a Fund\u2019s shares trading at\na premium or discount to the NAV. Index-\nRelated Risk. Each Fund seeks to achieve a\nreturn that corresponds generally to the price\nand yield performance, before fees and\nexpenses, of its Underlying Index as published\nby the Index Provider. There is no assurance\nthat the Index Provider or its agents will\nconstruct 10 or calculate the Underlying Index\naccurately. While the Index Provider describes\nwhat the Underlying Index is designed to\nachieve, neither the Index Provider nor its\nagents provide any warranty or accept any\nliability regarding the quality, accuracy or\ncompleteness of the Underlying Index or its\nrelated data, and they do not guarantee that\nthe Underlying Index will be in line with the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology. BFA also does\nnot provide any warranty or guarantee against\nthe Index Provider\u2019s or any agent\u2019s errors.\nThe Index Provider may rely on various sources\nof information to assess the criteria of\ncomponents of the Underlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on assumptions\nand estimates. Neither a Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology or sources of information will\nprovide an accurate assessment of included\ncomponents. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, particularly for indexes that are less\ncommonly used as benchmarks. In addition,\nthere may be heightened risks associated with\nthe adequacy and reliability of information\nabout emerging markets constituents, as such\nmarkets may have less information available or\nless regulatory oversight. Errors related to\nthe Underlying Index may negatively or\npositively impact a Fund and its shareholders.\nFor example, if the Underlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund will have\nexposure to such constituents and will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying Index\u2019s other\nconstituents. Shareholders should understand\nthat any gains from an Index Provider\u2019s errors\nwill be kept by the Fund and its shareholders\nand any losses or costs from such errors will\nbe borne by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnusual market conditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural disasters,\npolitical unrest or war) may impact an Index\nProvider or a third-party data provider and\ncould cause the Index Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to the Underlying Index.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. If a\nscheduled rebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that would otherwise be removed\nat the rebalance (due to, for example, changes\nin market capitalization or issuer credit\nratings) may remain, causing the performance\nand constituents of the Underlying Index to\nvary from those expected under normal\nconditions. In addition, to the extent\ncircumstances evolve between periodic index\nreviews and reconstitutions, the Underlying\nIndex may include constituents that do not\nalign with its objective or selection\ncriteria, and the Fund tracking the Underlying\nIndex may be similarly affected. In addition\nto scheduled rebalances, an Index Provider or\nits agents may carry out ad hoc index\nrebalances due to reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market conditions,\ncorporate events, or corrections of errors.\nThe Fund will in turn rebalance its portfolio\nto attempt to increase the correlation between\nthe portfolio and the Underlying Index. The\nFund and its shareholders will directly bear\nany transaction costs and market exposure from\nsuch portfolio rebalancing. Therefore, index-\nrelated errors and ad hoc rebalances may\nincrease a Fund\u2019s costs and tracking error.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, third-party vendor\nrisks, cyber attacks, trade disputes, product\nrecalls, liability and environmental damage\nclaims, scarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe products of industrial companies may face\nobsolescence due to technological developments\nand new product introduction. Furthermore,\nchanges in trade restrictions and tariffs as\nwell as broader geopolitical developments\ncould adversely affect industrial companies.\nThese companies also may be significantly\naffected by domestic and international\neconomic conditions, legislative and\nregulatory changes, and labor relations.\nIndustrial companies may depend on public or\nprivate sector financing, which may become\ndifficult to obtain due to government spending\nconstraints or reduced availability of\ncapital. Such companies may be unable to\nprotect their intellectual property rights or\nmay be liable for infringing the intellectual\nproperty rights of others. Issuers with high\ncarbon intensity or high switching costs\nassociated with the transition to low carbon\nalternatives may be more impacted by climate\ntransition risks. There may be increased\nimpact on a Fund's performance to the extent\nthat its investments are concentrated in\nlocations that are more susceptible to adverse\nphysical events. Issuer Risk. The performance\nof a Fund depends on the performance of\nindividual securities or other assets to which\nthe Fund has exposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a whole, due to\nchanges in the financial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or counterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller-capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions and competitive\nchallenges. Large-capitalization companies may\nbe more mature and subject to more limited\ngrowth potential compared with smaller-\ncapitalization companies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of a\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or loan Fund\nshares (to secure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party. There can be no\nassurance that any large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment or that the size of a Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares may adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the extent a Fund\npermits redemptions in cash, these redemptions\nmay force the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material effect on the\nmarket price of Fund shares, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains, and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as 11 receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such tax year. A\nFund also may be required to sell its more\nliquid investments to meet a large redemption,\nin which case the Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile, and more\ndifficult to price. To the extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund shares on the\nsecondary market, such transactions may\naccount for a large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may, therefore,\nhave a material upward or downward effect on\nthe market price of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s performance to the extent\nthat the Fund is delayed in investing new cash\nand is required to maintain a larger cash\nposition than it ordinarily would, diluting\nits investment returns. Management Risk. An\nindex Fund invests in securities or other\nassets included in, or representative of, its\nUnderlying Index, regardless of their\ninvestment merits. Such a Fund may be affected\nby a general decline in market segments\nrelated to its Underlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to invest the\nFund\u2019s assets in defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. Market disruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an adverse effect on a\nFund\u2019s ability to adjust its exposure to the\nrequired levels in order to track its\nUnderlying Index. Because BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy, a\nFund will not fully replicate its Underlying\nIndex and may hold securities or other assets\nnot included in the Underlying Index. As a\nresult, a Fund is subject to the risk that\nBFA\u2019s investment strategy, whose\nimplementation is subject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the intended\nresults. There is no guarantee that a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a high degree of\ncorrelation to those of its Underlying Index\nor that a Fund will achieve its investment\nobjective. Market Risk. A Fund could lose\nmoney over short periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over longer periods\nduring more prolonged market downturns. The\nvalue of a financial instrument or other asset\nmay decline due to changes in general market\nconditions, economic trends or events that are\nnot specifically related to the particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors that affect\none or more issuers, counterparties,\nexchanges, countries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or asset classes.\nLocal, regional or global events such as war,\nacts of terrorism, pandemics or other public\nhealth issues, recessions, the prospect or\noccurrence of a sovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments and could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s NAV. Changes\nin market and economic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all types of\ninstruments and assets. Market Trading Risk. A\nFund faces numerous market trading risks, any\nof which may lead to its shares trading in the\nsecondary market at a premium or discount to\nNAV or to the intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy Fund shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto NAV or sell Fund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a discount to the NAV, you\nmay pay significantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the underlying value\nof the Fund shares. Absence of an Active\nPrimary Market. Although Fund shares are\nlisted for trading on one or more stock\nexchanges, there can be no assurance that an\nactive primary trading market for Fund shares\nwill develop or be maintained by market makers\nor Authorized Participants. Secondary Listing\nRisks. A Fund\u2019s shares may be listed or traded\non U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other\nthan the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing is maintained. Fund shares\nalso may be available to non-U.S. investors\nthrough funds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary receipts. There\ncan be no assurance that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to trade on any such stock exchange\nor in any market or that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to meet the requirements for exchange\nlisting or market trading. A Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe less actively traded in certain markets\nthan in others, and investors are subject to\nthe execution and settlement risks and market\nstandards of the market where they or their\nbroker direct their trades for execution.\nCertain information that is available to\ninvestors who trade Fund shares on a U.S.\nstock exchange during regular U.S. market\nhours may not be available to investors who\ntrade in other markets, which may result in\nsecondary market prices in such markets being\nless efficient. Secondary Market Trading Risk.\nShares of a Fund may trade in the secondary\nmarket at times when the Fund does not accept\norders to create or redeem shares. At such\ntimes, shares may trade in the secondary\nmarket with more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might be experienced at\ntimes when the Fund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities held by a Fund\nmay be traded in markets that close at a\ndifferent time than an exchange on which Fund\nshares are traded. Liquidity in those\nsecurities may be reduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during the time\nwhen the exchange is open but after the\napplicable market closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be wider bid/ask\nspreads on the exchange and a greater premium\nor discount to NAV. In stressed market\nconditions, the market for a Fund\u2019s shares may\nbecome less liquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the markets for the\nFund\u2019s portfolio holdings, and an investor may\nbe unable to sell their Fund shares. Secondary\nmarket trading in Fund shares may be halted by\na stock exchange because of market conditions\nor for other reasons. In times of\nextraordinary market volatility, Fund shares\nmay be subject to trading halts pursuant to \u201c\ncircuit breaker \u201d rules of a stock exchange or\nmarket. If there is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an exchange or\nmarket, an investor may be unable to purchase\nor sell Fund shares. In addition, if trading\nin certain securities or financial instruments\nis restricted, this may disrupt a Fund\u2019s\ncreation/redemption process, affect the price\nat which Fund shares trade in the secondary\nmarket, and result in a Fund being unable to\ntrade certain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such circumstances, a Fund may\nbe unable to rebalance its portfolio or\naccurately price its portfolio holdings and\nmay incur substantial trading losses. 12\nShares of a Fund, similar to shares of other\nissuers listed on a stock exchange, may be\nsold short and are therefore subject to the\nrisk of increased volatility and price\ndecreases associated with being sold short. In\naddition, trading activity in derivative\nproducts based on a Fund may lead to increased\ntrading volume and volatility in the secondary\nmarket for the shares of the Fund. Fund Shares\nMay Trade at Prices Other Than NAV . Shares of\na Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at,\nabove or below the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. A\nFund\u2019s NAV is calculated at the end of each\nbusiness day and fluctuates with changes in\nthe market value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. The trading price of a Fund\u2019s shares\nfluctuates throughout trading hours based on\nboth market supply of and demand for Fund\nshares and the underlying value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the\ntrading prices of a Fund\u2019s shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant redemption requests,\nor other unusual market conditions However,\nbecause Fund shares can be created and\nredeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or premiums to a\nFund\u2019s NAV are not likely to be sustained over\nthe long term (unlike shares of many closed-\nend funds, which frequently trade at\nappreciable discounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While the\ncreation/redemption feature is designed to\nmake it more likely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock exchanges at\nprices close to the Fund\u2019s next calculated\nNAV, exchange prices are not expected to\ncorrelate exactly with the Fund\u2019s NAV due to\ntiming reasons, supply and demand imbalances\nand other factors. In addition, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers, Authorized\nParticipants, or other market participants,\nand during periods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading prices for\nshares of a Fund that differ significantly\nfrom its NAV. Authorized Participants may be\nless willing to create or redeem a Fund\u2019s\nshares if there is a lack of an active market\nfor such shares or the Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments, which may contribute to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or Selling Fund\nShares. Buying or selling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of costs that\napply to all securities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you will likely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is\nthe difference between what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares (the \u201c bid \u201d\nprice) and the price at which they are willing\nto sell Fund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price). The\nspread varies over time for Fund shares based\non trading volume and market liquidity. It is\ngenerally narrower if a Fund has more trading\nvolume and market liquidity and wider if a\nFund has less trading volume and market\nliquidity. Increased market volatility also\nmay cause wider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other charges that are\nincurred as a result of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in buying or\nselling Fund shares, frequent trading may\ndetract significantly from investment results,\nand an investment in Fund shares may not be\nadvisable for investors who anticipate\nregularly making small investments through a\nbrokerage account. Mid-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Investments in mid-\ncapitalization companies may be riskier, less\nliquid, more volatile and more susceptible to\neconomic, market and industry changes than\ninvestments in large-capitalization companies.\nMid-capitalization companies may have more\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources and management experience. As a\nresult, they generally are more vulnerable\nthan large-capitalization companies to adverse\nbusiness and economic developments. Mid-\ncapitalization companies may have a shorter\nbusiness track record, with relatively less\ninformation available to investors. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than\nthe securities of larger companies. National\nClosed Market Trading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held by a Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s shares trade is\nopen, there are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current price and its\nlast quoted price ( i.e ., the quote from the\nclosed foreign market to the Fund). The impact\nof a closed foreign market on a Fund is likely\nto be greater where a large portion of the\nFund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed foreign\nmarket or when a foreign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s\nNAV that may be greater than those experienced\nby other funds. Non-Diversification Risk. A\nFund that is classified as \u201c non-diversified \u201d\nmay invest a greater percentage of its assets\nin securities or other instruments\nrepresenting a small number of issuers or\ncounterparties, compared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified. \u201d A non-\ndiversified Fund thus may be more susceptible\nto the risks associated with these particular\nissuers or counterparties. The gains and\nlosses on such holdings may have a greater\nimpact on a non-diversified Fund\u2019s performance\nthan they would on the performance of a\ndiversified Fund, and a non-diversified Fund\u2019s\nNAV may be more volatile. Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk. Investments in the securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of\ninvesting in the markets where such issuers\nare located, including heightened risks of\ninflation, nationalization and market\nfluctuations caused by economic and political\ndevelopments. As a result of investing in\nnon-U.S. securities, the Funds may be subject\nto increased risk of loss caused by any of the\nfactors listed below: \u25a0 Government\nintervention in issuers' operations or\nstructure; \u25a0 A lack of market liquidity and\nmarket efficiency; \u25a0 Greater securities price\nvolatility; \u25a0 Exchange rate fluctuations and\nexchange controls; \u25a0 Less availability of\npublic information about issuers; \u25a0\nLimitations on foreign ownership of\nsecurities; \u25a0 Imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; \u25a0 Imposition of restrictions on\nthe expatriation of the funds or other assets\nof a Fund; 13 \u25a0 Higher transaction and custody\ncosts and delays in settlement procedures; \u25a0\nDifficulties in enforcing contractual\nobligations; \u25a0 Lower levels of regulation of\nthe securities markets; \u25a0 Weaker accounting,\ndisclosure and reporting requirements and the\nrisk of being delisted from U.S. exchanges;\nand \u25a0 Legal principles relating to corporate\ngovernance, directors\u2019 fiduciary duties and\nliabilities and stockholders\u2019 rights in\nmarkets in which the Fund invests may differ\nfrom or may not be as extensive or protective\nas those that apply in the U.S. Withholding\nTax Reclaims Risk . The Funds may file claims\nto recover withholding tax on dividend and\ninterest income (if any) received from issuers\nin certain countries where such withholding\ntax reclaim is possible. Whether or when the\nFunds will receive a withholding tax refund in\nthe future is within the control of the tax\nauthorities in such countries. Where the Funds\nexpects to recover withholding tax based on a\ncontinuous assessment of probability of\nrecovery, the NAV of the Funds generally\nincludes accruals for such tax refunds. The\nFund continues to evaluate tax developments\nfor potential impact to the probability of\nrecovery. If the likelihood of receiving\nrefunds materially decreases, for example due\nto a change in tax regulation or approach,\naccruals in the Fund\u2019s NAV for such refunds\nmay need to be written down partially or in\nfull, which will adversely affect that Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Investors in the Funds at the time an\naccrual is written down will bear the impact\nof any resulting reduction in NAV regardless\nof whether they were investors during the\naccrual period. Conversely, if a Fund receives\na tax refund that has not been previously\naccrued, investors in the Funds at the time\nthe claim is successful will benefit from any\nresulting increase in the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nInvestors who sold their shares prior to such\ntime will not benefit from such NAV increase.\nOperational Risk. Each Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. Each Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Real Estate Companies Risk.\nReal estate companies, which include real\nestate investment trusts, real estate holding\nand operating companies, and real estate\nmanagement or development companies, expose\ninvestors to the risks of owning real estate\ndirectly as well as to the risks from the way\nthat such companies operate. Real estate\ncompanies and property values may be adversely\naffected by regulations and other governmental\nactions, including tax increases, zoning\nchanges and other usage restrictions,\nenvironmental regulations, regulatory\nlimitations on rent or eviction, and eminent\ndomain. Certain real estate companies, such as\nREITs, could fail to qualify for favorable tax\nor regulatory treatment. Real estate is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and can be subject to intense\ncompetition and periodic overbuilding. Real\nestate companies may own a limited number of\nproperties and concentrate their investments\nin a particular geographic region, industry or\nproperty type. Economic downturns or other\nadverse events (e.g., natural disasters) that\naffect a particular region, industry or\nproperty type may lead to decreases in\nproperty values, leasing declines and defaults\nby borrowers or tenants. In the event of a\ndefault, a real estate company may experience\nsubstantial delays and costs in enforcing its\nrights with respect to the property and\nprotecting its investment. In addition,\nbecause real estate is relatively illiquid, a\ncompany may be constrained in its ability to\ndiversify or liquidate its investments in\nresponse to economic conditions or other\nevents. Real estate companies may depend on\nthe management skills of a few key individuals\nand may have limited financial resources. They\nmay be highly leveraged, which can magnify\nlosses, and interest rate increases can make\nit difficult for them, as well as borrowers\nand tenants, to obtain debt financing and meet\npayment obligations. Declining interest rates\ncould result in increased prepayment on loans\nand require redeployment of capital in less\ndesirable investments. Certain real estate\ncompanies, such as REITs, could fail to\nqualify for favorable tax or regulatory\ntreatment, which could produce adverse\neconomic consequences for the company and its\ninvestors, including a Fund. 14 Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk. The economies of many\ncountries or regions in which the Funds invest\nare highly dependent on trade with certain key\ntrading partners. Reduction in spending on\nproducts and services by these key trading\npartners, institution of tariffs or other\ntrade barriers or a slowdown in the economies\nof key trading partners may adversely affect\nthe performance of any company in which a Fund\ninvests and have a material adverse effect on\na Fund\u2019s performance. Risk of Investing in\nChina. Fund to risks specific to China. The\nChinese economy is subject to a considerable\ndegree of economic, political and social\ninstability. Political and Social Risk. The\nChinese government is authoritarian and has\nperiodically used force to suppress civil\ndissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of\neconomic liberalization may lead to social\nturmoil, violence and labor unrest. In\naddition, China continues to experience\ndisagreements related to integration with Hong\nKong and religious and nationalist disputes in\nTibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater\nrisk in China than in many other countries of\ncurrency fluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate fluctuations and\nhigher rates of inflation as a result of\ninternal social unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries. Unanticipated political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. China's growing\nincome inequality, rapidly aging population\nand significant environmental issues also are\nfactors that may affect the Chinese economy.\nGovernment Control and Regulations. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, government control over certain\nsectors or enterprises and significant\nregulation of investment and industry is still\npervasive, including restrictions on\ninvestment in companies or industries deemed\nto be sensitive to particular national\ninterests, trading of securities of Chinese\nissuers, foreign ownership of Chinese\ncorporations and/or the repatriation of assets\nby foreign investors. Limitations or\nrestrictions on foreign ownership of may have\nadverse effects on the liquidity and\nperformance of Fund and could lead to higher\ntracking error. Chinese markets generally\ncontinue to experience inefficiency,\nvolatility and pricing anomalies that may be\nconnected to governmental influence, lack of\npublicly available information political and\nsocial instability. Chinese , such as those in\nthe financial services or technology sectors,\nand potentially other sectors are also subject\nto the risk that Chinese authorities can\nintervene in their operations and structure,\nwhich may negatively affect the value of a\ninvestments. Economic Risk. The Chinese\neconomy may be adversely affected by, among\nother things, a deterioration in global demand\nfor Chinese exports or a contraction in\nspending on domestic goods by Chinese\nconsumers. In addition, China may experience\nsubstantial rates of inflation, significant\nindebtedness or economic recessions, which\nwould have a negative effect on its economy\nand securities market. Delays in enterprise\nrestructuring, slow development of well-\nfunctioning financial markets and widespread\ncorruption have also hindered the performance\nof the Chinese economy. China continues to\nreceive substantial pressure from trading\npartners to liberalize official currency\nexchange rates. Expropriation Risk. The\nChinese government maintains a major role in\neconomic policymaking, and investing in China\ninvolves risk of loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and on repatriation of\ncapital invested. Limited Information and\nLegal Remedies . Chinese are not subject to\nthe same degree of regulatory requirements,\naccounting standards or auditor oversight as\nin more developed countries. As a result,\ninformation about the Chinese securities in\nwhich the Funds invest may be less reliable or\ncomplete. There may be significant obstacles\nto obtaining information necessary for\ninvestigations into or litigation against\nChinese , and may have limited legal remedies.\nThe Funds are not actively managed and do not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. 15 Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries. Investment\nin developed country issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and other risks\nassociated with developed countries. Developed\ncountries generally tend to rely on services\nsectors ( e.g., the financial services sector)\nas the primary means of economic growth. A\nprolonged slowdown in one or more services\nsectors is likely to have a negative impact on\neconomies of certain developed countries,\nalthough economies of individual developed\ncountries can be impacted by slowdowns in\nother sectors. In the past, certain developed\ncountries have been targets of terrorism, and\nsome geographic areas in which the Fund\ninvests have experienced strained\ninternational relations due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities, defense\nconcerns and other security concerns. These\nsituations may cause uncertainty in the\nfinancial markets in these countries or\ngeographic areas and may adversely affect the\nperformance of the issuers to which the Fund\nhas exposure. Heavy regulation of certain\nmarkets, including labor and product markets,\nmay have an adverse effect on certain issuers.\nSuch regulations may negatively affect\neconomic growth or cause prolonged periods of\nrecession. Many developed countries are\nheavily indebted and face rising healthcare\nand retirement expenses. In addition, price\nfluctuations of certain commodities and\nregulations impacting the import of\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Risk of Investing in\nEmerging Markets. Investments in emerging\nmarket issuers are subject to a greater risk\nof loss than investments in issuers located or\noperating in more developed markets. This is\ndue to, among other things, the potential for\ngreater market volatility, lower trading\nvolume, higher levels of inflation, social,\npolitical or economic instability, greater\nrisk of a market shutdown and more\ngovernmental limitations on foreign\ninvestments in emerging market countries than\nare typically found in more developed markets.\nSome countries in which the Fund may invest\nmay experience economic instability, including\ninstability resulting from substantial rates\nof inflation or significant devaluations of\ntheir currency, or economic recessions, which\nwould have a negative effect on the economies\nand securities markets of their economies.\nSome of these countries may also impose\nrestrictions on the exchange or export of\ncurrency or adverse currency exchange rates\nand may be characterized by a lack of\navailable currency hedging instruments.\nDisparities of wealth, the pace and success of\ndemocratization and ethnic, religious and\nracial disaffection, among other factors, may\nexacerbate social unrest, violence and labor\nunrest in some of the countries in which the\nFund may invest. Unanticipated or sudden\npolitical or social developments may result in\nsudden and significant investment losses.\nCompanies in many emerging markets are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries, and as a result, information about\nthe securities in which the Funds invest may\nbe less reliable or complete. Moreover,\nemerging markets often have less reliable\nsecurities valuations and greater risks\nassociated with custody of securities than\ndeveloped markets. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and shareholders may have limited\nlegal remedies. The Fund does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. In addition, emerging markets\noften have greater risk of capital controls\nthrough such measures as taxes or interest\nrate control than developed markets. Certain\nemerging market countries may also lack the\ninfrastructure necessary to attract large\namounts of foreign trade and investment.\nChronic structural public sector deficits in\nsome countries in which the Fund may invest\nmay adversely impact securities held by the\nFund. Local securities markets in emerging\nmarket countries may trade a small number of\nsecurities and may be unable to respond\neffectively to changes in trading volume,\npotentially making prompt liquidation of\nholdings difficult or impossible at times.\nSettlement procedures in emerging market\ncountries are frequently less developed and\nreliable than those in the U.S. (and other\ndeveloped countries). In addition, significant\ndelays may occur in certain markets in\nregistering the transfer of securities.\nSettlement or registration problems may make\nit more difficult for the Fund to value its\nportfolio securities and could have an adverse\neffect on the Fund in seeking to achieve its\ninvestment objective. Investing in emerging\nmarket countries involves a higher risk of\nloss due to expropriation, nationalization,\nconfiscation of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on foreign\ninvestments and on repatriation of capital\ninvested in certain emerging market countries.\nAs a result, investments in certain countries\nin which the Fund may invest may be subject to\nloss due to expropriation or nationalization\nof assets and property or the imposition of\nrestrictions on foreign investments and\nrepatriation of capital. Risk of Investing in\nJapan. Japan may be subject to political,\neconomic, and labor risks, among others. Any\nof these risks, individually or in the\naggregate, can impact an investment made in\nJapan. Currency Risk . The Japanese yen has\nfluctuated widely at times, and any increase\nin its value may cause a decline in exports\nthat could weaken the Japanese economy. The\nJapanese government has, in the past,\nintervened in the currency markets to attempt\nto maintain or reduce the value of the yen.\nJapanese intervention in the currency markets\ncould cause the value of the yen to fluctuate\nsharply and unpredictably and could cause\nlosses to investors. Economic Risk . The\ngrowth of Japan's economy has recently lagged\nthat of its Asian neighbors and other major\ndeveloped economies. Since 2000, Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth rate has generally remained\nlow relative to other advanced economies, and\nit may remain low in the future. The Japanese\neconomy is heavily dependent on international\ntrade and has been adversely affected in the\npast by trade tariffs, other protectionist\nmeasures, competition from emerging economies\nand the economic conditions of its trading\npartners. Japan is also heavily dependent on\noil and other commodity imports, and higher\ncommodity prices could therefore have a\nnegative impact on the Japanese economy. 16\nGeographic Risk. Natural disasters, such as\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and\ntsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding\nareas and could negatively affect the Japanese\neconomy, and, in turn, could negatively affect\nthe value of Fund. Labor Risk . Japan has an\naging workforce and has experienced a\nsignificant population decline in recent\nyears. Japan\u2019s labor market appears to be\nundergoing fundamental structural changes, as\na labor market traditionally accustomed to\nlifetime employment adjusts to meet the need\nfor increased labor mobility, which may\nadversely affect Japan\u2019s economic\ncompetitiveness. Large Government and\nCorporate Debt Risk . The Japanese economy\nfaces several concerns, including a financial\nsystem with large levels of nonperforming\nloans, over-leveraged corporate balance\nsheets, extensive cross-ownership by major\ncorporations, a changing corporate governance\nstructure, and large government deficits.\nThese issues may cause a slowdown of the\nJapanese economy. Political Risk .\nHistorically, Japan has had unpredictable\nnational politics and may experience frequent\npolitical turnover. Future political\ndevelopments may lead to changes in policy\nthat might adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. In addition, China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan. Japan's\npolitical relationship with China, however, is\nstrained and delicate. Should political\ntension increase, it could adversely affect\nthe Japanese economy and destabilize the\nregion as a whole. Security Risk. Japan's\nrelations with its neighbors, particularly\nChina, North Korea, South Korea and Russia,\nhave at times been strained due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities and defense\nconcerns. Most recently, the Japanese\ngovernment has shown concern over the\nincreased nuclear and military activity by\nNorth Korea and China. Strained relations may\ncause uncertainty in the Japanese markets and\nadversely affect the overall Japanese economy,\nparticularly in times of crisis. Risk of\nInvesting in Saudi Arabia. Investing in Saudi\nArabian issuers involves legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, and economic\nrisks that are specific to Saudi Arabia. Saudi\nArabia is highly reliant on income from the\nsale of petroleum and trade with other\ncountries involved in the sale of petroleum,\nand its economy is therefore vulnerable to\nchanges in foreign currency values and the\npetroleum market. A sustained decrease in\npetroleum prices could have a negative impact\non all aspects of the economy. In addition,\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s economy relies heavily on\ncheap, foreign labor, and changes in the\navailability of this labor supply could have\nan adverse effect on the economy. Investments\nin the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers\ninvolve risks not typically associated with\ninvestments in securities of issuers in more\ndeveloped countries, which may negatively\naffect the value of a Fund\u2019s investments. Such\nheightened risks may include, among others,\nthe expropriation and/or nationalization of\nassets, restrictions on and government\nintervention in international trade,\nconfiscatory taxation, political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision-making,\narmed conflict, crime and instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. The government of Saudi\nArabia exercises substantial influence over\nmany aspects of the private sector, and its\nactions could significantly impact the value\nof Saudi Arabian securities. Although some\neconomic reforms (e.g., privatization) are\nunderway, restrictions on foreign ownership\npersist, and the government has an ownership\nstake in many key industries. Saudi Arabia has\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Economic sanctions (or the threat of\nthem) on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi\nArabian corporate entities may have an adverse\nimpact on the Saudi Arabian economy and\nsecurities. The ability of foreign investors\nto invest in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership of such securities. In\naddition, the Saudi Arabian government places\ninvestment limitations on the ownership of\nSaudi Arabian issuers by foreign investors.\nSuch limits may prevent a Fund from investing\nin accordance with its strategy, resulting in\ntracking error against the Underlying Index.\nSaudi Arabia Broker Risk. There are a number\nof ways to conduct transactions in equity\nsecurities in the Saudi Arabian market. A Fund\ngenerally expects to transact in a manner so\nthat it is not limited by Saudi Arabian\nregulations to a single broker. However, there\nmay be a limited number of brokers who can\nprovide services to a Fund, which may have an\nadverse impact on the prices, quantity or\ntiming of Fund transactions. A limited number\nof brokers may impact a Fund\u2019s ability to\nachieve best execution on transactions. In\naddition, a Fund may be more susceptible to\ncredit loss or trading disruptions in the\nevent of a default or business disruption\namong the available brokers. If a Fund\u2019s use\nof a broker is disrupted, there could be an\nadverse impact on the Fund\u2019s operations and\nits ability to track the Underlying Index, and\nthe Fund\u2019s shares could trade at a premium or\ndiscount to NAV. A Fund may also incur losses\ndue to the acts or omissions of its brokers in\nthe execution or settlement of transactions or\nin the transfer of funds or securities. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S. Investing in U.S.\nissuers involves legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic risks that\nare specific to the U.S. A decrease in imports\nor exports, changes in trade regulations,\ninflation, an economic recession, financial\nsystem stress, or political turmoil, among\nother risks, may have an adverse effect on the\nU.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges. The U.S. is also subject to the\nrisk of natural disasters, such as droughts,\nearthquakes, fires and floods. U.S. security\nrisks include acts of terrorism, internal\nunrest and a deterioration in relations\nbetween the U.S. and certain countries. Any of\nthese may adversely affect the U.S. economy,\nfinancial markets or issuers. Governmental\nagencies project that the U.S. will maintain\nelevated public debt levels for the\nforeseeable future. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily indicate or cause\neconomic problems, the costs of servicing such\ndebt may constrain future economic growth.\nCircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal on\nU.S. government debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. 17 Securities Lending\nRisk. A Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that a\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. A\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nSemiconductor Companies Risk. Semiconductor\nCompanies Risk. The semiconductor industry is\nhighly cyclical, and semiconductor companies\nface risks related to rapid technological\ndevelopments and product obsolescence,\nfrequent new product introduction and\nunpredictable changes in growth rates. Capital\nequipment expenditures as well as research and\ndevelopment costs can be substantial.\nSemiconductor companies depend significantly\non patent and intellectual property rights and\nmay be adversely affected by the loss or\nimpairment of these rights. Semiconductor\nmanufacturing processes are highly complex and\nsophisticated, and they are vulnerable to\nimpurities and other disruptions that can\nsignificantly increase costs and delay\nproduction. Semiconductor companies may rely\non a limited number of suppliers of the\ncomponents and raw materials used in their\nproducts. Supply chain disruptions or the lack\nof raw materials can lead to significant\noperational challenges, including production\nhalts. Semiconductor companies also face\ncompetitive challenges in attracting and\nretaining highly skilled personnel. Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Investments in\nsmall-capitalization companies may be riskier,\nless liquid, more volatile and more\nsusceptible to economic, market and industry\nchanges than investments in large- or mid-\ncapitalization companies. Small-capitalization\ncompanies may have more limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, personnel and\nmanagement experience. As a result, they\ngenerally are more vulnerable than larger\ncompanies to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Small-capitalization companies\nmay have a short business track record, with\nrelatively less information available to\ninvestors. The securities of smaller companies\nmay trade less frequently and in lower volumes\nthan the securities of larger companies. Some\nsecurities of smaller issuers may be illiquid\nor restricted as to resale, and their values\nmay have significant volatility. A Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such\nsecurities at any time, or at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet the Fund\u2019s\nobligations. Small Fund Risk. When a Fund\u2019s\nsize is small, the Fund may experience low\ntrading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In\naddition, the Fund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if it does not meet certain\nrequirements set by the listing exchange. If a\nFund were required to delist from the listing\nexchange, the Fund\u2019s value may rapidly decline\nand its performance may be negatively\nimpacted. Any resulting liquidation of the\nFund could lead to elevated transaction costs\nfor the Fund and negative tax consequences for\nits shareholders. Sustainability Risk.\nSustainability risk is an inclusive term to\ndesignate investment risk (probability or\nuncertainty of occurrence of material losses\nrelative to the expected return of an\ninvestment) that relates to environmental,\nsocial or governance issues. Sustainability\nrisk around environmental issues includes, but\nis not limited to, climate risk, both physical\nand transition risk. Physical risk arises from\nthe physical effects of climate change, acute\nor chronic. For example, frequent and severe\nclimate-related events can impact products and\nservices and supply chains. Transition risk \u2013\nwhether policy, technology, market or\nreputation risk \u2013 arises from the adjustment\nto a low-carbon economy in order to mitigate\nclimate change. Risks related to social issues\ncan include, but are not limited to, labor\nrights and community relations. Governance-\nrelated risks can include but are not limited\nto risks around board independence, ownership\nand control, and audit and tax management.\nThese risks can impact an issuer\u2019s operational\neffectiveness and resilience as well as its\npublic perception and reputation, affecting\nits profitability and, in turn, its capital\ngrowth and ultimately impacting the value of\nholdings in a Fund. These are only examples of\nsustainability risk factors, and\nsustainability risk factors do not solely\ndetermine the risk profile of the investment.\nThe relevance, severity, materiality and time\nhorizon of sustainability risk factors and\nother risks can differ significantly across\nFunds. Sustainability risk can manifest itself\nthrough different existing risk types\nincluding, but not limited to, market,\nliquidity, concentration, credit and asset-\nliability mismatch risk. For example, a Fund\nmay invest in the securities of an issuer that\ncould face potentially reduced revenues or\nincreased expenditures from physical climate\nrisk ( e.g ., decreased production capacity\ndue to supply chain perturbations, lower sales\ndue to demand shocks or higher operating or\ncapital costs) or transition risk ( e.g .,\ndecreased demand for carbon-intensive products\nand services or increased production costs due\nto changing input prices). As a result,\nsustainability risk factors may have a\nmaterial impact on an investment, may increase\nvolatility, may affect liquidity and may have\nan adverse impact on the value of shares of a\nFund. The impact of those risks may be higher\nfor Funds with particular sectoral or\ngeographic concentrations. For example, Funds\nwith geographic concentration in locations\nsusceptible to adverse weather conditions\nwhere the value of the investments in the\nFunds may be more susceptible to adverse\nphysical climate events, or Funds with\nspecific sectoral concentrations, such as\ninvesting in industries or issuers with high\ncarbon intensity or high switching costs\nassociated with the transition to low carbon\nalternatives, may be more impacted by climate\ntransition risks. All or a combination of\nthese factors may have an unpredictable impact\non a Fund\u2019s investments. Under normal market\nconditions, such events could have a material\nimpact on the value of shares of a Fund.\nAssessments of sustainability risk are\nspecific to the asset class and to a fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Different asset classes\nrequire different data and tools to apply\nheightened scrutiny, assess materiality, and\nmake meaningful differentiation among issuers\nand assets. To the extent consistent with a\nFund\u2019s investment objective, risks are\nconsidered and risk managed concurrently, by\nprioritizing in part based on materiality and\non the Fund\u2019s objective. 18 The impacts of\nsustainability risk are likely to develop over\ntime, and new sustainability risks may be\nidentified as further data and information\nregarding sustainability factors and impacts\nbecome available. Technology Companies Risk.\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources and personnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence as well as\nunexpected risks and costs related to new\nproduct introduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies may\nbe adversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs. Telecommunications\nSector Risk. The telecommunications sector is\nsubject to extensive government regulation.\nThe costs of complying with governmental\nregulations, delays or failure to receive\nrequired regulatory approvals, or the\nenactment of new regulatory requirements may\nnegatively affect the business of\ntelecommunications companies. Government\nactions around the world, specifically in the\narea of pre-marketing clearance of products\nand prices, can be arbitrary and\nunpredictable. Companies in the\ntelecommunications sector may encounter\ndistressed cash flows due to the need to\ncommit substantial capital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may make the\nproducts and services of certain\ntelecommunications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers are generally\nrequired to obtain franchises or licenses in\norder to provide services in a given location.\nLicensing and franchise rights in the\ntelecommunications sector are limited, which\nmay provide an advantage to certain\nparticipants. Limited availability of such\nrights, high barriers to market entry and\nregulatory oversight, among other factors,\nhave led to consolidation of companies within\nthe sector, which could lead to further\nregulation or other negative effects in the\nfuture. Thematic Investing Risk. A Fund relies\non the Index Provider to identify securities\nthat reflect the relevant themes and sub-\nthemes for inclusion in the Underlying Index.\nThere is no guarantee that the Underlying\nIndex or a Fund will reflect the intended\ntheme and sub-theme exposures. A Fund\u2019s\nperformance may suffer if such securities are\nnot correctly identified, if a theme or sub-\ntheme develops in an unexpected manner, or if\nsecurities in the Underlying Index do not\nbenefit from the development of a theme or\nsub-theme. A Fund\u2019s performance may also be\nimpacted if securities that are not related to\nthe theme or sub-theme are included in the\nUnderlying Index. Threshold/Underinvestment\nRisk. If certain aggregate and/or fund-level\nownership thresholds are reached through\ntransactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates\nor a Fund, or as a result of third-party\ntransactions or actions by an issuer or\nregulator, the ability of BFA and its\naffiliates on behalf of clients (including a\nFund) to purchase or dispose of investments,\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. The capacity of a Fund\nto invest in certain securities or other\nassets may be affected by the relevant\nthreshold limits, and such limitations may\nhave adverse effects on the liquidity and\nperformance of the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nTo the extent a Fund tracks an index, such\nlimits may increase the risk of the Fund being\nunderinvested in an asset relative to its\nUnderlying Index and increase the risk of\ntracking error. For example, ownership limits\nmay apply to securities whose issuers operate\nin certain regulated industries or in certain\ninternational markets. Such limits also may\napply where the investing entity (such as a\nFund) is subject to corporate or regulatory\nownership restrictions or invests in certain\nfutures or other derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel amounts invested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including a Fund) may not\nexceed the relevant limits without the grant\nof a license or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent. In other cases, exceeding such\nthresholds may cause BFA and its affiliates, a\nFund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions.\nTracking Error Risk. A Fund may be subject to\n\u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence of\na Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin a Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by a Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; a Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by a Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for a Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index, such\nas during a rebalancing or reconstitution; and\nimpacts to a Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. A Fund that\ntracks an index composed of a large number of\nsecurities or other assets may experience\ngreater tracking error than a Fund that tracks\na more narrow index. Tracking error risk may\nbe heightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nU.S. Economic Risk. The U.S. is a significant\ntrading partner of, or foreign investor in, a\nnumber of countries. As a result, the economic\nconditions of such countries may be\nparticularly affected by changes in the U.S.\neconomy, such as a decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, changes in trade regulations, changes\nin the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an\neconomic slowdown in the U.S. Any such event\nmay have an adverse effect on the economies of\nU.S. trading partners and the securities\nissuers in such countries, which in turn could\nnegatively impact a Fund\u2019s investments.\nCircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal on\nU.S. government debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. 19 Utility Companies\nRisk. Utility infrastructure often requires\nsignificant capital expenditures, and utility\ncompanies may face high interest costs and\ndifficulty in raising capital. Technological\ninnovations may render existing equipment or\nproducts obsolete, and companies may\nexperience difficulty in obtaining regulatory\napproval of new technologies. Utility\noperations may be disrupted by events that\ntarget or damage utility infrastructure,\nincluding natural disasters and cyber or other\nattacks. Utilities companies may be adversely\naffected by volatility in the price of certain\nenergy resources. Utility companies face risks\nfrom government regulation and oversight as\nwell as from deregulation (if applicable).\nRegulators may monitor and control companies\u2019\nrevenues and costs. There is no assurance that\nregulators will grant rate increases or that\nrate levels will be adequate to permit the\npayment of stock dividends or bond coupon\npayments. In addition, there may be regulatory\nrestrictions on the ability of utility\ncompanies to enter new lines of business and\ngeographic areas. Utility companies incur\ncosts in complying with environmental and\nother regulations and may face significant\nchallenges in obtaining regulatory approval\nfor certain projects, such as nuclear power\nplants. Utility companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. Energy conservation, climate\nchange and other sustainability policies also\nmay impact utility companies. Deregulation may\nsubject companies to greater competition, may\nadversely affect their profitability and may\nlead them to engage in riskier ventures.\nValuation Risk. The price that a Fund could\nreceive upon the sale (or other disposition)\nof a security or other asset may differ from\nthe Fund\u2019s valuation of the security or other\nasset, particularly for securities or other\nassets that trade in low volume or volatile\nmarkets or that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received by a Fund also\nmay differ from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index (if applicable). Because\nnon-U.S. exchanges or markets may be open on\ndays or during time periods when a Fund does\nnot price its shares, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. In addition, for\npurposes of calculating a Fund's NAV, the\nvalue of assets denominated in non-U.S.\ncurrencies (if any) is translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. This\ntranslation may result in a difference between\nthe prices used to calculate a Fund's NAV and\nthe prices used by the Underlying Index,\nwhich, in turn, could result in a difference\nbetween the Fund's performance and the\nperformance of the Underlying Index.\nAuthorized Participants that create or redeem\nFund shares on days when a Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or lower or\nhigher redemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\nassets not been fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology. The ability to\nvalue investments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party service\nproviders. Portfolio Holdings Information A\ndescription of the policies and procedures\nwith respect to the disclosure of the Funds'\nportfolio securities and other assets (as\napplicable) is available in the applicable\nStatement of Additional Information ( \u201c SAI \u201d\n). Each Fund discloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com. Fact sheets\nproviding information about each Fund\u2019s top\nholdings are posted on www.iShares.com when\navailable and may be requested by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737). Management of\nthe Funds Investment Adviser As investment\nadviser, BFA has overall responsibility for\nthe general management and administration of\nthe Funds. BFA provides an investment program\nfor the Funds and manages the investment of\nthe Funds\u2019 assets. In seeking to achieve the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment objectives, BFA\nuses teams of portfolio managers, investment\nstrategists and other investment specialists\nand may draw upon the trading, research and\nexpertise of its affiliates. This team\napproach brings together many disciplines and\nleverages BFA\u2019s extensive resources. BFA is an\nindirect wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ) and is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. As of\nJune 30, 2024, BFA and its affiliates provided\ninvestment advisory services for assets of\napproximately $10.6 trillion. From time to\ntime, an employee of BlackRock may express\nviews regarding a particular security or other\ninstrument, asset class, company, industry, or\nmarket sector. Such views are the views of\nonly that individual as of the time expressed.\nThey do not necessarily represent the views of\nBlackRock or any other person within the\nBlackRock organization. Such views may change\nat any time based upon market or other\nconditions, and BlackRock has no\nresponsibility to update such views. You\nshould not rely on any such views as\ninvestment advice or as an indication of\ntrading intent on behalf of a Fund. Fees and\nExpenses Pursuant to the Investment Advisory\nAgreement between BFA and the Trust (entered\ninto on behalf of the Funds), BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\neach Fund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses and any\nextraordinary expenses (as determined by a\nmajority of the Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the Trust). Operating\nexpenses paid by BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude acquired fund fees\nand expenses, if any. 20\n\nA discussion regarding the basis for the\napproval by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the\n\u201c Board \u201d ) of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement with BFA is available in the Funds\u2019\nForm N-CSR filed with the SEC for the period\nended October 31 and in the applicable\nfinancial statements posted at\nwww.iShares.com. For its investment advisory\nservices to each Fund, for the fiscal year\nended April 30, 2024, BFA was paid a\nmanagement fee from each Fund, as a percentage\nof the Fund\u2019s average daily net assets, net of\nany applicable waivers, at the annual rate set\nforth in the table below. If BFA has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fees for a Fund, the contractual\nwaiver may be terminated prior to its\nexpiration date only upon written agreement of\nthe Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from\ntime to time voluntarily waive and/or\nreimburse fees or expenses to reduce a Fund\u2019s\ntotal annual fund operating expenses\n(excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if\nany). Any such voluntary waiver or\nreimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime.\n                                              \n  Fund                        Management Fee  \n  iShares Core High Dividend  0.08%           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Environmentally     0.30%           \n  Aware Real Estate ETF                       \n  iShares Global Clean        0.41%1          \n  Energy ETF                                  \n  iShares Global REIT ETF     0.14%           \n  iShares International       0.48%           \n  Developed Real Estate ETF                   \n  iShares International       0.49%1          \n  Select Dividend ETF                         \n  iShares Select Dividend     0.38%1          \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \n1 The management fee schedule for the Fund,\nincluding its breakpoint pricing arrangements,\nis described in the Fund\u2019s Statement of\nAdditional Information. Portfolio Managers The\nPortfolio Managers for each Fund are\nresponsible for various functions related to\nportfolio management, including, but not\nlimited to, investing cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of their respective\nportfolio management teams to focus on certain\nasset classes, implementing investment\nstrategy, researching and reviewing investment\nstrategy and overseeing members of their\nrespective teams who have more limited\nresponsibilities. Jennifer Hsui, Greg Savage\nand Paul Whitehead are primarily responsible\nfor the day-to-day management of the Funds.\nJennifer Hsui has been employed by BFA or its\naffiliates as a senior portfolio manager since\n2007. She is a Managing Director of BlackRock,\nInc. Greg Savage has been employed by BFA or\nits affiliates as a portfolio manager since\n2006. He is a Managing Director of BlackRock,\nInc.

BFA and its Affiliates act,\nor may act, as an investor, research provider,\ninvestment manager, commodity pool operator,\ncommodity trading advisor, financier,\nunderwriter, adviser, trader, lender, index\nprovider, agent and/or principal. BFA and its\nAffiliates may have other direct and indirect\ninterests in securities, currencies,\ncommodities, derivatives and other assets in\nwhich a Fund may directly or indirectly\ninvest. BFA and its Affiliates may engage in\nproprietary trading and advise accounts and\nother funds that have investment objectives\nsimilar to those of a Fund and/or that engage\nin and compete for transactions in the same or\nsimilar types of securities, currencies and\nother assets as are held by a Fund. This may\ninclude transactions in securities issued by\nother open-end and closed-end investment\ncompanies, including investment companies that\nare affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the\nextent permitted under the Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as amended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ).\nThe trading activities of BFA and its\nAffiliates are carried out without reference\nto positions held directly or indirectly by a\nFund. These activities may result in BFA or an\nAffiliate having positions in assets that are\nsenior or junior to, or that have interests\ndifferent from or adverse to, the assets held\nby a Fund. A Fund may invest in securities\nissued by, or engage in other transactions\nwith, entities with which an Affiliate has\nsignificant debt or equity investments or\nother interests. A Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as debt offerings or\nstructured notes) for which an Affiliate is\ncompensated for providing advisory, cash\nmanagement or other services. A Fund also may\ninvest in securities of, or engage in other\ntransactions with, entities for which an\nAffiliate provides or may provide research\ncoverage or other analysis. An Affiliate may\nhave business relationships with, and receive\ncompensation from, distributors, consultants\nor others who recommend a Fund or who engage\nin transactions with or for a Fund. Neither\nBlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any\nobligation to share any investment\nopportunity, idea or strategy with a Fund. As\na result, an Affiliate may compete with a Fund\nfor appropriate investment opportunities. The\nresults of a Fund\u2019s investment activities,\ntherefore, may differ from those of an\nAffiliate and of other accounts managed by an\nAffiliate. It is possible that a Fund could\nsustain losses during periods in which one or\nmore Affiliates and other accounts achieve\nprofits on their trading for proprietary or\nother accounts. The opposite result is also\npossible. In addition, a Fund may enter into\ntransactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or\ntheir directors, officers, employees or\nclients have an adverse interest. A Fund may\nbe adversely impacted by the effects of\ntransactions undertaken by BFA or an Affiliate\nor their directors, officers, employees or\nclients. From time to time, BlackRock or its\nadvisory clients (including other funds and\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of a\nFund. The price, availability, liquidity, and\n(in some cases) expense ratio of a Fund may be\nimpacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by\nBlackRock or its advisory clients. A Fund\u2019s\nactivities may be limited because of\nregulatory restrictions applicable to BFA or\nan Affiliate or their policies designed to\ncomply with such restrictions. Under a\nsecurities lending program approved by the\nBoard, the Funds have retained BTC, an\nAffiliate of BFA, to serve as their securities\nlending agent to the extent that they\nparticipate in the securities lending program.\nFor these services, the securities lending\nagent will receive a fee from the\nparticipating Fund based on the returns earned\non the Fund\u2019s lending activities, including\ninvestment of the cash received as collateral\nfor the loaned securities. In addition, one or\nmore Affiliates may be among the entities to\nwhich a Fund may lend its portfolio securities\nunder the securities lending program. Under an\nETF Services Agreement, certain iShares ETFs\nhave retained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the\n\u201c Distributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an Affiliate of\nBFA, to perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d )\non the design and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may have, or from\ntime to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its Affiliates. BlackRock and its\nAffiliates may benefit from a Fund using a\nBlackRock index by creating increasing\nacceptance in the marketplace for such\nindexes. BlackRock and its Affiliates are not\nobligated to license an index to a Fund, and\nno Fund is under an obligation to use a\nBlackRock index. The terms of a Fund\u2019s index\nlicensing agreement with BlackRock or its\nAffiliates may not be as favorable as the\nterms offered to other licensees. The\nactivities of BFA and its Affiliates and their\nrespective directors, officers or employees\nmay give rise to other conflicts of interest\nthat could disadvantage a Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to address these potential\nconflicts of interest. Please see the SAI for\nfurther information. Shareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder information, including\nhow to buy and sell shares of the Funds, is\navailable free of charge by calling toll-free\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting\nwww.iShares.com. 22 Buying and Selling Shares\nTransactions in shares of the Funds occur in\nthe primary market and the secondary market.\nPrimary market transactions, known as \u201c\ncreations \u201d and \u201c redemptions, \u201d occur only\nbetween the Funds and Authorized Participants\n( i.e ., financial institutions that are\nauthorized to participate in such\ntransactions), as described in the Creations\nand Redemptions section below. Fund shares are\nlisted on U.S. national securities exchanges,\nwhere they can be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day at market prices, like shares\nof other publicly traded companies. A Fund\u2019s\nshares may also be available in other\nsecondary markets, such as on non-U.S.\nexchanges and through funds or structured\ninvestment vehicles similar to depositary\nreceipts. The Funds do not impose any minimum\ninvestment for Fund shares purchased on an\nexchange or otherwise in the secondary market.\nBuying or selling Fund shares on an exchange\nor other secondary market generally involves\ntwo types of costs that are common in\nsecurities transactions. First, when buying or\nselling Fund shares through a broker, you may\nincur a brokerage commission and other\ncharges. The commission is frequently a fixed\namount; it may be a significant proportional\ncost if you are seeking to buy or sell small\namounts of shares. Second, you may incur the\ncost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is any\ndifference between the bid price and the ask\nprice for the shares. The spread varies over\ntime based on a Fund\u2019s trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. Generally, the spread is\nsmaller if a Fund has high trading volume and\nmarket liquidity, and larger if a Fund has\nlower trading volume and market liquidity. The\nlatter is often the case for newly launched or\nsmaller funds. A Fund\u2019s spread may also be\nimpacted by the liquidity (or lack thereof) of\nthe underlying securities or other assets held\nby the Fund, particularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds, or by instances of\nsignificant volatility of the underlying\nassets. The U.S. national securities exchanges\nthat list Fund shares are open for trading\nMonday through Friday and are closed on\nweekends and the following holidays (or the\ndays on which they are observed): New Year\u2019s\nDay, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents\u2019\nDay, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day\nand Christmas Day. Investments in Investment\nCompanies Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments by investment\ncompanies, including foreign and unregistered\ninvestment companies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For example, a\nregistered investment company (the \u201c Acquired\nFund \u201d ), such as the Funds, may not knowingly\nsell or otherwise dispose of any security\nissued by the Acquired Fund to any investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquiring Fund \u201d ) or any\ncompany or companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale\nor disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company\nor companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund,\nor (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and other investment\ncompanies and companies controlled by them.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, registered\ninvestment companies are permitted to invest\nin a Fund beyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions set forth in Rule 12d1-4 under the\n1940 Act. To make such an investment in an\nAcquired Fund, a registered investment company\nmust, among other things, enter into an\nagreement with the Trust. If an Acquired Fund\ninvests significantly in other registered\ninvestment companies in reliance on Rule\n12d1-4, an Acquiring Fund will not be\npermitted to rely on Rule 12d1-4 and invest in\nthe Fund beyond the Section 12(d)(1) limits.\nAny investment company interested in\npurchasing shares of a Fund beyond the limits\nset forth in Section 12(d)(1) should contact\nBFA. Foreign investment companies are\npermitted to invest in a Fund only up to the\nlimits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject\nto any applicable SEC no-action relief. Book\nEntry Shares of the Funds are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The Depository Trust\nCompany ( \u201c DTC \u201d ), which serves as the\nsecurities depository for shares of the Funds,\nor its nominee is the record owner of, and\nholds legal title to, all outstanding shares\nof the Funds. Investors owning Fund shares are\nbeneficial owners as shown on the records of\nDTC or its participants. DTC participants\ninclude securities brokers and dealers, banks,\ntrust companies, clearing corporations and\nother institutions that directly or indirectly\nmaintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As\na beneficial owner of Fund shares, you are not\nentitled to receive physical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares registered in\nyour name, and you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares. Therefore, to\nexercise any right as an owner of Fund shares,\nyou must rely upon the procedures of DTC and\nits participants. These procedures are the\nsame as those that apply to any other\nsecurities held in book-entry or \u201c street name\n\u201d form. Share Prices The trading prices of a\nFund\u2019s shares in the secondary market\ngenerally differ from the Fund\u2019s daily NAV and\nare affected by various factors, such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF shares and the\nsecurities or other assets held by a Fund as\nwell as other market and economic conditions.\n23 Determination of Net Asset Value The NAV of\na Fund normally is determined once daily\nMonday through Friday, on each day that the\nNew York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) is open\nfor trading. The NAV generally is determined\nas of the close of the NYSE\u2019s regular trading\nhours, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, based\non prices at the time of closing. Any Fund\nassets or liabilities that are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing\nmarket rates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data service providers.\nThe NAV of a Fund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s net assets ( i.e .,\nthe value of its total assets, including the\nvalue of any underlying fund shares in which\nthe Fund invests, less total liabilities) by\nthe total number of outstanding shares of the\nFund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.\nThe value of a Fund\u2019s assets and liabilities\nis determined pursuant to BFA\u2019s valuation\npolicies and procedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the valuation\ndesignee for each Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5\nunder the Investment Company Act. Equity\nsecurities and other equity instruments for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at market value, which is generally\ndetermined using the last reported official\nclosing price or, if a reported closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on the\nexchange or market on which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at the time of\nvaluation. Shares of underlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds) that are not\ntraded on an exchange are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying ETFs and closed-\nend funds that trade on exchanges are valued\nat their most recent market closing price.\nFixed-income securities are valued using last\navailable bid prices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or prices\n(including evaluated prices) supplied by the\nFunds\u2019 approved independent third-party\npricing services, each in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s valuation policies and procedures.\nPricing services may use matrix pricing or\nvaluation models that utilize certain inputs\nand assumptions to derive values. Pricing\nservices generally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly transactions of an\ninstitutional round lot size, but a Fund may\nhold or transact in such securities in smaller\nodd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower\nprices than institutional round lots. An\namortized cost method of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations with 60 days\nor less remaining to maturity unless BFA\ndetermines in good faith that such method does\nnot represent fair value. Generally, trading\nin certain instruments ( e.g ., non-U.S.\nsecurities, money market instruments, etc.) is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of the NYSE\u2019s regular\ntrading hours. The values of such instruments\nused in computing a Fund\u2019s NAV are determined\nas of such times. For certain foreign assets,\na third-party vendor supplies evaluated,\nsystematic fair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-factor model\nafter the relevant foreign markets have\nclosed. This systematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to correlate the\nprices of foreign assets in one or more\nnon-U.S. markets following the close of the\nlocal markets to the prices that might have\nprevailed as of a Fund\u2019s pricing time.\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options may\nbe valued using a mathematical model that may\nincorporate a number of market data factors.\nWhen market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in accordance with its policies\nand procedures. Fair value represents a good\nfaith approximation of the value of an asset\nor liability. It is the amount that the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive from the\ncurrent sale of an asset or the cost to\nextinguish a liability in an arm\u2019s-length\ntransaction. BFA may conclude that a market\nquotation is not readily available or is\nunreliable if: \u25a0 An asset or liability does\nnot have a price source due to its lack of\ntrading or other reasons; \u25a0 A market quotation\ndiffers significantly from recent price\nquotations or otherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value; \u25a0 The asset or liability\nis thinly traded; \u25a0 There is a significant\nevent subsequent to the most recent market\nquotation; or \u25a0 The trading market on which an\ninstrument is listed is suspended or closed\nand no appropriate alternative trading market\nis available. A \u201c significant event \u201d is\ndeemed to occur if BFA determines, in its\nreasonable business judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u2019s assets or\nliabilities, that the event is likely to cause\na material change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nof the Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities. Valuing a\nFund\u2019s investments using fair value pricing\nmay result in prices that differ from current\nmarket valuations and that may not be the\nprices at which those investments could have\nbeen sold during the period for which the\nparticular fair values were used. For an index\nFund, the use of both fair value prices and\ncurrent market valuations in a particular NAV\ncalculation could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying index. This could, in turn, result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of its underlying index.\n24 Dividends and Distributions General\nPolicies. A Fund generally declares and pays\ndividends from net investment income, if any,\nat least once a year. Distributions of net\nrealized securities gains, if any, generally\nare declared and paid once a year, but the\nTrust may make distributions on a more\nfrequent basis for a Fund. The Trust reserves\nthe right to declare special distributions if,\nin its reasonable discretion, such action is\nnecessary or advisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d )\nor to avoid the imposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or realized\ngains. Dividends and other distributions on\nFund shares are distributed on a pro rata\nbasis to beneficial owners of the shares.\nDividend payments and other distributions are\nmade through DTC participants and indirect\nparticipants to beneficial owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from the Funds.\nDividend Reinvestment Service. No dividend\nreinvestment service is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make the DTC book-entry\nDividend Reinvestment Program available to\nbeneficial owners of Fund shares for the\nreinvestment of distributions. Beneficial\nowners should contact their broker to\ndetermine the availability and costs of the\nservice and the details of participation.\nBrokers may require beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and timetables.\nIf the program is used, dividend distributions\nof both income and realized gains will be\nautomatically reinvested in additional whole\nFund shares purchased in the secondary market.\nNote on Tax Information. The following\nsections summarize some of the consequences\nunder current U.S. federal tax law of an\ninvestment in a Fund. This information is not\na substitute for personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and local taxation on\nFund distributions and sales of Fund shares.\nDistributions that are attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal government\nobligations may be exempt from certain state\nand local tax. Consult your personal tax\nadvisor about the potential tax consequences\nof an investment in Fund shares under all\napplicable tax laws. Taxes As with any\ninvestment, you should consider how your\ninvestment in shares of a Fund will be taxed,\nincluding possible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or when you sell Fund\nshares. The tax information in this Prospectus\nis provided as general information, based on\ncurrent law. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund. There is no\nguarantee that shares of a Fund will receive\ncertain regulatory or accounting treatment.\nTaxes on Fund Distributions Shareholders in a\nFund will receive information after the end of\neach calendar year setting forth the amount of\ndividends and long-term capital gains\ndistributed to them by the Fund during the\nprior year, if any. Likewise, the amount of\ntax-exempt income, if any, that a Fund\ndistributes will be reported. Such income must\nbe reported on the shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax return. In general, distributions\nare subject to U.S. federal income tax for the\nyear when they are paid. Certain distributions\npaid in January, however, may be treated as\npaid on December 31 of the prior year. Capital\nGains. Distributions from a Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than qualified\ndividend income or from net tax-exempt income,\nif any), including distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and distributions out\nof a Fund\u2019s net short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as ordinary income.\nDistributions by a Fund of net long-term\ncapital gains, if any, in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses (capital gain dividends)\nare taxable to you as long-term capital gains,\nregardless of how long you have held the\nFund\u2019s shares. Long-term capital gains and\nqualified dividend income are generally\neligible for taxation at preferential rates\nfor non-corporate shareholders. However,\ndifferent preferential rates may apply\ndepending on the type of capital gains, such\nas Fund distributions of certain amounts\nreceived from REITs, if any. Return of\nCapital. If a Fund\u2019s distributions exceed\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits,\nall or a portion of the distributions made in\nthe taxable year may be recharacterized as a\nreturn of capital to shareholders. A return of\ncapital distribution generally will not be\ntaxable but will reduce the shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis and result in a higher capital gain or\nlower capital loss when those shares on which\nthe distribution was received are sold. Once a\nshareholder\u2019s cost basis is reduced to zero,\nfurther distributions will be treated as\ncapital gains, if the shareholder holds shares\nof the Fund as capital assets. Distributions\nin excess of a Fund\u2019s minimum distribution\nrequirements, but not in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be taxable to\nshareholders and will not constitute\nnontaxable returns of capital. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by a Fund that\nqualify as qualified dividend income, if any,\nare taxable to you at long-term capital gain\nrates. Dividends will be qualified dividend\nincome to you if they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income received by a Fund.\nGenerally, qualified dividend income includes\ndividend income from stock issued by taxable\nU.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S.\ncorporations, provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements and has\nnot hedged its position in the stock in\ncertain ways. For this purpose, a qualified\nnon-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S.\ncorporation that is eligible for benefits\nunder a comprehensive income tax treaty with\nthe U.S., which includes an exchange of\ninformation program, or if the stock with\nrespect to which the dividend was paid is\nreadily tradable on an established U.S.\nsecurities market. The term excludes a\ncorporation that is a passive foreign\ninvestment company. Dividends received by a\nFund from a RIC, if any, generally are\nqualified dividend income only to the extent\nthat such dividend distributions are made out\nof qualified dividend income received by such\nRIC. Additionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from a REIT, if\nany, 25 and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a Fund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified business income\n\u201d deduction for non-corporate U.S.\nshareholders to the extent that the Fund\u2019s\nincome is derived from ordinary REIT\ndividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.\nFor a dividend to be treated as qualified\ndividend income, the dividend must be received\nwith respect to a share of stock held without\nbeing hedged by the relevant Fund, and with\nrespect to a share of the Fund held without\nbeing hedged by you, for 61 days during the\n121-day period beginning at the date that is\n60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such date. Fund\ndistributions, to the extent attributable to\ndividends from U.S. corporations, will be\neligible for the dividends received deduction\nfor Fund shareholders that are corporations,\nsubject to certain hedging and holding\nrequirements. Substitute dividends received by\na Fund with respect to dividends paid on\nsecurities lent out, if any, will not be\nqualified dividend income. Medicare Tax. A\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is\nimposed on \u201c net investment income, \u201d\nincluding, but not limited to, interest,\ndividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if\nmarried and filing jointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Alternative Minimum Tax. The AMT is a\nseparate U.S. federal tax system that operates\nin parallel to the regular federal income tax\nsystem but eliminates many deductions and\nexclusions. The AMT has different tax rates\nand treats as taxable certain types of income\nthat are nontaxable for regular income tax\npurposes, such as the interest on certain \u201c\nprivate activity \u201d municipal bonds. If a\ntaxpayer\u2019s overall AMT liability is higher\nthan regular income tax liability, then the\ntaxpayer owes the regular income tax liability\nplus the difference between the AMT liability\nand the regular income tax liability. Market\nDiscount Bonds Any market discount recognized\non a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or adjusted issue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount. To the extent that a\nFund does not include the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gains on the Fund\u2019s\ndisposition of such an obligation will be\ntreated as ordinary income rather than capital\ngains to the extent of the accrued market\ndiscount. Derivatives and Other Complex\nInstruments A Fund may invest in derivatives\nand other complex instruments, and such\ninvestments may be subject to special and\ncomplicated rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund\nare treated as ordinary income or capital\ngains, accelerate the recognition of income to\na Fund or defer a Fund\u2019s ability to recognize\nlosses. In addition, these rules may affect\nthe amount, timing or character of income\ndistributed to you by a Fund. You should\nconsult your personal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules. Non-U.S.\nIncome Taxes Dividends, interest and capital\ngains (if any) earned by a Fund with respect\nto securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may\ngive rise to withholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If,\nat the close of a year, more than 50% of a\nFund\u2019s total assets consist of non-U.S. stocks\nor securities (generally, for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ), generally the Fund may \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to you certain non-U.S. income\ntaxes, including withholding taxes, paid by\nthe Fund. This means that you would be\nconsidered to have received as an additional\ndividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes,\nbut you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your U.S.\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not pass through\nnon-U.S. taxes, the Fund will be entitled to\nclaim a deduction for certain foreign taxes\nthat it incurs. Under certain circumstances,\nif a Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes\npaid with respect to a prior year, the value\nof Fund shares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions passed\nthrough to shareholders with respect to the\nFund\u2019s foreign taxes for the current year\ncould be reduced. If, at the close of the\nyear, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets\nconsist of stocks or securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers, including depositary\nreceipts (no matter where traded) of non-U.S.\ncompanies, or, at the close of each quarter,\nmore than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets consist\nof shares of an Underlying Fund, the Fund may\n\u201c pass-through \u201d to you certain non-U.S.\nincome taxes (including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund or, if its assets meet these\nrequirements, the Underlying Fund. For\npurposes of foreign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of a Fund, foreign capital gains\ntaxes may not produce associated foreign\nsource income, limiting the availability of\nsuch credits for U.S. persons. Non-U.S.\nShareholders If you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S.\nentity (other than a pass-through entity to\nthe extent owned by U.S. persons), a Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term capital\ngains), if any, generally will be 26 subject\nto a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless\na lower treaty rate applies. However,\nwithholding tax generally will not apply to\nany gain or income realized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder with respect to any distribution\nof long-term capital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of Fund shares. Separately,\na 30% withholding tax may be imposed on Fund\ndistributions (if any) paid to certain foreign\nentities, unless such entities comply, or are\ndeemed compliant, with extensive reporting and\nwithholding requirements designed to inform\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury of\nU.S.-owned foreign investment accounts. Real\nProperty Interests If at least 50% of a Fund's\nassets consist of U.S. real property\ninterests, including certain REITs and U.S.\nreal property holding corporations (as defined\nin the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury\nregulations), special rules may apply to a\nforeign shareholder receiving a Fund\ndistribution. Distributions that are\nattributable to gains from the disposition of\na U.S. real property interest will be taxable\nas ordinary dividends and subject to\nwithholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if\nthe foreign shareholder held no more than 5%\nof the Fund's shares at any time during the\none-year period ending on the date of the\ndistribution. If the foreign shareholder held\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares, the\ndistribution will be treated as income\neffectively connected with a trade or business\nwithin the U.S. As a result, the foreign\nshareholder will be subject to withholding tax\nat a rate of 21% and generally will be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences generally will\napply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the\nsale of shares of a Fund with at least 50% of\nits assets in U.S. real property interests,\nunless (i) the Fund is domestically controlled\n(meaning that more than 50% of the value of\nthe Fund's shares is held directly or\nindirectly by U.S. shareholders) or (ii) the\nforeign shareholder owns no more than 5% of\nthe Fund's shares at any time during the five-\nyear period ending on the date of the sale.\nShareholders that are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities are urged to consult their\nown tax advisor about the potential tax\nconsequences to them of an investment in a\nFund whose assets include U.S. real property\ninterests. Backup Withholding If you are a\nresident or a citizen of the U.S. and you have\nnot provided a taxpayer identification number\nor social security number and made other\nrequired certifications, by law, backup\nwithholding at a 24% rate will apply to Fund\ndistributions and proceeds (if any).\nSecurities Lending If your shares of a Fund\nare loaned out pursuant to a securities\nlending arrangement, you may lose the ability\nto treat Fund dividends that are paid while\nthe shares are held by the borrower as\nqualified dividend income, and you may lose\nthe ability to use non-U.S. tax credits passed\nthrough by the Fund. Fund of Funds If a Fund\ninvests in an Underlying Fund, short-term\ncapital gains earned by the Underlying Fund,\nif any, will be ordinary income when\ndistributed to the Fund and will not be offset\nby the Fund\u2019s capital losses. To the extent\nsuch Fund is expected to invest in an\nUnderlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s realized losses on\nsales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be\nindefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c wash\nsales. \u201d Capital loss carryforwards of the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will not offset net\ncapital gains of the Fund. Taxes on the Sale\nof Exchange-Listed Fund Shares Any capital\ngain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund\nshares is generally treated as a long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares have been\nheld for more than one year. Any capital gain\nor loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares\nthat have been held for one year or less is\ngenerally treated as a short-term capital gain\nor loss. However, any capital loss on a sale\nof Fund shares held for six months or less is\ntreated as a long-term capital loss to the\nextent that capital gain dividends were paid\nwith respect to such shares. Any such capital\ngains, including from sales of Fund shares or\nfrom capital gain dividends, are included in \u201c\nnet investment income \u201d for purposes of the\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax\nmentioned above. Creations and Redemptions\nPrior to being traded in the secondary market,\nFund shares are \u201c created \u201d at NAV by\nAuthorized Participants ( i.e. , market\nmakers, large investors and other financial\ninstitutions) in block-size Creation Units or\nmultiples thereof. Fund shares are created or\nredeemed only in Creation Units, and only\nAuthorized Participants may create or redeem\nCreation Units with the Funds. Each Authorized\nParticipant is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC and\nhas entered into a written agreement with the\nFunds\u2019 Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. The\nagreement allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. Authorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units for their own\naccounts or for customers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of the Funds. Creation\ntransactions are subject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the relevant Fund. Generally,\nthere are three transaction methods for\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares: in-kind\nsecurities ( \u201c in-kind \u201d ), partial cash and\nall cash. 27\n\nIn-Kind . In a creation transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits into a Fund a\n\u201c creation basket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets designated by the\nFund, as well as a cash amount. The Authorized\nParticipant receives a specified number of\nCreation Units in return. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits Creation Units with a Fund and\nreceives from the Fund a \u201c redemption basket,\n\u201d which is a portfolio of securities or other\nassets designated by the Fund, as well as a\ncash amount. Partial Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund a creation basket and a\ncash amount, including cash that replaces a\nsecurity or other asset in the creation\nbasket, in exchange for Creation Units. In a\nredemption transaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation Units with a\nFund and receives from the Fund a redemption\nbasket and a cash amount, including cash that\nreplaces a security or other asset in the\nredemption basket. All Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund an amount of cash\nspecified by the Fund in exchange for Creation\nUnits. In a redemption transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits Creation Units\nwith a Fund and receives from the Fund a\nspecified amount of cash. The creation and\nredemption baskets for a Fund may differ in\ncomposition, and certain iShares ETFs accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d More information about\ncustom baskets is provided in the Funds\u2019 SAI.\nEach Fund generally engages in creation and\nredemption transactions according to the\nmethod indicated in the table below. In\ncertain circumstances, however, a Fund may use\nanother transaction method ( e.g. , an in-kind\nFund may transact partially or fully in cash).\n                                              \n  Fund        In-Kind  Partial      All Cash  \n                       Cash                   \n  iShares                                     \n  Core High   \u2713                               \n  Dividend                                    \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Environme\u2026           \u2713                      \n  Aware Real                                  \n  Estate ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Global               \u2713                      \n  Clean                                       \n  Energy ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Global               \u2713                      \n  REIT ETF                                    \n  iShares                                     \n  Internati\u2026                                  \n  Developed            \u2713                      \n  Real                                        \n  Estate ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Internati\u2026                                  \n  Select               \u2713                      \n  Dividend                                    \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Select      \u2713                               \n  Dividend                                    \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nThe prices at which creations and redemptions\noccur are based on the next calculation of a\nFund\u2019s NAV after a creation or redemption\norder is tendered in an acceptable form under\nthe Authorized Participant agreement. In the\nevent of a system failure or other\ninterruption, including disruptions at market\nmakers or Authorized Participants, creation\nand redemption orders may not be executed\naccording to a Fund\u2019s instructions or may not\nbe executed at all. Additional information\nabout the creation and redemption of Creation\nUnits (including the cut-off times for the\nreceipt of creation and redemption orders) is\nincluded in the Funds\u2019 SAI. The Funds do not\nimpose restrictions on the frequency of\npurchases and redemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with a Fund. The Board determined not\nto adopt policies and procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares because each Fund\ngenerally sells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions that are in-kind\nand/or for cash, with a deadline for placing\ncash-related transactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities. However, the Funds have\ntaken certain measures ( e.g. , imposing\ntransaction fees on purchases and redemptions\nof Creation Units and reserving the right to\nreject purchases of Creation Units under\ncertain circumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of frequent cash\npurchases and redemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased tracking\nerror, disruption of portfolio management,\ndilution to the Funds, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the vast majority\nof trading in Fund shares occurs on the\nsecondary market, which does not involve the\nFunds directly, and such trading is unlikely\nto cause many of the harmful effects of\nfrequent cash purchases or redemptions of Fund\nshares. To the extent a Fund engages in in-\nkind transactions, the Fund intends to comply\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws in\naccepting securities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with redemption\nsecurities by, among other means, assuring\nthat any securities accepted for deposit and\nany securities used to satisfy redemption\nrequests will be sold in transactions that\nwould be exempt from registration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201c 1933\nAct \u201d ). Further, an Authorized Participant\nthat is not a \u201c qualified institutional buyer,\n\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 144A under\nthe 1933 Act, will not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. Because Fund shares may be\ncreated and issued on an ongoing basis, at any\npoint during the life of a Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is used in the\n1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nthat could render them statutory underwriters\nsubject to the prospectus delivery and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nmust take into account all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each particular case.\nBroker-dealers should also note that dealers\nwho are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution (as contrasted\nto ordinary secondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part of an \u201c\nunsold allotment \u201d within the meaning of\nSection 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be\nunable to take advantage of the prospectus\ndelivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3)\nof the 1933 Act. For delivery\n\n28\n\nof prospectuses to exchange members, the\nprospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153\nunder the 1933 Act is available only with\nrespect to transactions on a national\nsecurities exchange. Householding Householding\nis an option available to certain Fund\ninvestors. Householding is a method of\ndelivery, based on the preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a single copy of\ncertain shareholder documents can be delivered\nto investors who share the same address, even\nif their accounts are registered under\ndifferent names. Please contact your broker-\ndealer if you are interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a single copy of\nprospectuses and other shareholder documents,\nor if you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change your\nhouseholding status. Distribution The\nDistributor or its agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the iShares ETFs on an agency basis.\nThe Distributor does not maintain a secondary\nmarket in shares of the Funds. The Distributor\nhas no role in determining the policies of the\nFunds or the securities or other assets (as\napplicable) that are purchased or sold by the\nFunds. The Distributor\u2019s principal address is\n50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. BFA or\nits affiliates make payments to broker-\ndealers, registered investment advisers, banks\nor other intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, data provision services, or\ntheir making shares of iShares ETFs available\nto their customers generally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such payments, which may\nbe significant to the intermediary, are not\nmade by the Funds. Rather, such payments are\nmade by BFA or its affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or indirectly\nin part from fees paid by the iShares ETFs.\nPayments of this type are sometimes referred\nto as revenue-sharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions about which\ninvestment options it recommends or makes\navailable, or the level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the payments or\nother financial incentives the intermediary is\neligible to receive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives that are offered\nor made to an intermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary and its\ncustomers and may cause the intermediary to\nrecommend iShares ETFs over another\ninvestment. More information regarding these\npayments is contained in the applicable SAI.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments that their firm\nmay receive from BFA or its affiliates.\nFinancial Highlights The financial highlights\ntable for each Fund is intended to help you\nunderstand the Fund\u2019s financial performance\nfor the past five fiscal years or, if shorter,\nthe period since the Fund\u2019s inception. Certain\ninformation reflects financial results for a\nsingle Fund share. The total return\ninformation represents the rate that an\ninvestor would have earned (or lost) on an\ninvestment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment\nof all dividends and distributions. This\ninformation has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is\nincluded, along with each Fund\u2019s financial\nstatements, in the Annual Report for the Fund\n(available upon request and at www.ishares.com\n). 29\n\nFor a share outstanding throughout each\nperiod:\n                                              \n                iShar\u2026                        \n

Example. This Example is intended to\nhelp you compare the cost of owning shares of\nthe Fund with the cost of investing in other\nfunds. The Example assumes that you invest\n$10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated and then sell all of your shares at\nthe end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return\neach year and that the Fund\u2019s operating\nexpenses remain the same. Although your actual\ncosts may be higher or lower, based on these\nassumptions, your costs would be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $5          $16      $28       $64  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 36% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae US Dividend and Buyback\nIndex SM (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index is designed to provide\nexposure to U.S.-based companies that return\ncapital to shareholders through either\ndividend payments or share buybacks. The\nUnderlying Index consists of companies with\nthe largest dividend and buyback programs in\nthe market measured by adjusted shareholder\nyield, as determined by Morningstar, Inc. ( \u201c\nMorningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index is a subset of the\nMorningstar US Market Index (the \u201c Parent\nIndex \u201d ), which is a broad market index that\nrepresents approximately 97% of the market\ncapitalization of publicly traded U.S. stocks.\nConstituent securities of the Parent Index\nthat have had recent aggregate dividend yield\nand net buyback yield ( \u201c total shareholder\nyield \u201d ) greater than 0.1%, as calculated by\nthe Index Provider, are eligible for inclusion\nin the Underlying Index. The Index Provider\u2019s\nadjusted shareholder yield calculation gives a\n75% weighting to trailing twelve-month\ndividend yields and 25% weighting to trailing\ntwo-year net buyback yields. Companies in the\ntop 5% of total shareholder yield are removed.\nThe remaining companies are selected by\ndecreasing order of adjusted shareholder yield\nuntil 50% coverage of total shareholder payout\ndollars of the Parent Index (excluding any\ncompanies with a negative total shareholder\nyield) is reached. The \u201c total shareholder\npayout dollars \u201d of a company is defined as\nthe total shareholder yield multiplied by the\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of the\ncompany. The Underlying Index is weighted by\ntotal shareholder payout dollars and\nconstrained by capping each individual\nconstituent at 4.9%. In addition, the sector\nweights are constrained within 5% (positive or\nnegative) of the Parent Index. The Underlying\nIndex includes large-, mid- and small-\ncapitalization companies and may S-1\n\nchange over time. As of April 30, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nfinancials industry or sector. The components\nof the Underlying Index are likely to change\nover time. BFA uses an indexing approach to\ntry to achieve the Fund\u2019s investment\nobjective. Unlike many investment companies,\nthe Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it\ntracks and does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund\u2019s total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk . Investing in dividend-paying stocks\ninvolves the risk that such stocks may fall\nout of favor with investors and underperform\nother types of stocks or the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of the stocks held by the Fund will\nnot declare dividends in the future or will\nreduce or eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends), which may adversely affect the\nFund. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider S-2 or a third-\nparty data provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Buyback Risk. A\nstock buyback may signal that a company\u2019s\nmanagement believes the company\u2019s stock price\nis undervalued. However, a company\u2019s\nannouncement of a share buyback strategy may\nnot be an accurate predictor of future share\nperformance. Concentration Risk. The Fund may\nbe susceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIssuer Risk . The performance of the Fund\ndepends on the performance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to which the Fund\nhas exposure. The value of securities or other\nassets may decline, or perform differently\nfrom the market as a whole, due to changes in\nthe financial condition or credit rating of\nthe issuer or counterparty. Management Risk .\nThe Fund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies, small-capitalization companies may\nbe less stable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of small-\ncapitalization companies S-3 may be more\nvolatile and less liquid than those of mid-\nand large-capitalization companies. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s share price may be more\nvolatile than that of a fund with a greater\ninvestment in large- or mid-capitalization\nstocks. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-4\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-5\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2017, 2017 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-6\n\niSHARES \u00ae CORE DIVIDEND GROWTH ETF Ticker:\nDGRO Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment\nObjective The iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF\n(the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment\nresults of an index composed of U.S. equities\nwith a history of consistently growing\ndividends. Fees and Expenses The following\ntable describes the fees and expenses that you\nwill incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of\nthe Fund. The investment advisory agreement\nbetween iShares Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and\nBlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) provides\nthat BFA will pay all operating expenses of\nthe Fund, except: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv)\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.08%     None       0.00%       0.08%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $8          $26      $45      $103  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 25% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae US Dividend Growth Index SM\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which is a\ndividend dollar-weighted index that seeks to\nmeasure the performance of U.S. companies\nselected based on a consistent history of\ngrowing dividends. The Underlying Index is a\nsubset of the Morningstar \u00ae US Market Index SM\n, which is a broad market index that\nrepresents approximately 97% of the market\ncapitalization of publicly traded U.S. stocks.\nEligible companies must pay a qualified\ndividend, must have at least five years of\nuninterrupted annual dividend growth and their\nearnings payout ratio must be less than 75%.\nCompanies that are in the top decile based on\ndividend yield are excluded from the\nUnderlying Index prior to the dividend growth\nand payout ratio screens. The Underlying Index\nmay include large-, mid- and small-\ncapitalization companies and may change over\ntime. As of April 30, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the financials\nand industrials industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. S-7\n\nBFA uses a representative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c Representative\nsampling \u201d is an indexing strategy that\ninvolves investing in a representative sample\nof securities that collectively has an\ninvestment profile similar to that of an\napplicable underlying index. The securities\nselected are expected to have, in the\naggregate, investment characteristics (based\non factors such as market capitalization and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return variability\nand yield) and liquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying index. The\nFund may or may not hold all of the securities\nin the Underlying Index. The Fund generally\nwill invest at least 80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of its Underlying Index\nand may invest up to 20% of its assets in\ncertain futures, options and swap contracts,\ncash and cash equivalents, including shares of\nmoney market funds advised by BFA or its\naffiliates, as well as in securities not\nincluded in the Underlying Index, but which\nBFA believes will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part of that\nposition for the purposes of calculating the\npercentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar Inc. ( \u201c Morningstar \u201d or the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d ), which is independent of\nthe Fund and BFA. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition and relative\nweightings of the securities in the Underlying\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk . Investing in dividend-paying stocks\ninvolves the risk that such stocks may fall\nout of favor with investors and underperform\nother types of stocks or the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of the stocks held by the Fund will\nnot declare dividends in the future or will\nreduce or eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends), which may adversely affect the\nFund. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized S-8 Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Small-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies, small-capitalization companies may\nbe less stable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of small-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge- or mid-capitalization stocks. S-9\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-10\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-11\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2014, 2014 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-12\n\niSHARES \u00ae DOW JONES U.S. ETF Ticker: IYY Stock\nExchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective The\niShares Dow Jones U.S. ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d )\nseeks to track the investment results of a\nbroad-based index composed of U.S. equities.\nFees and Expenses The following table\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you will\nincur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $20         $64     $113      $255  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 3% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Dow Jones U.S. Index (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ), which measures the performance of\nthe broad U.S. equity market. The Underlying\nIndex is composed of all the U.S. companies in\nthe Dow Jones Global Index. The Underlying\nIndex aims to consistently represent the top\n95% of U.S.-traded stocks based on a float-\nadjusted market capitalization. The\nconstituents of the Underlying Index must be\ncommon shares or other securities that have\ncharacteristics of common equities and must\nmeet certain minimum liquidity criteria. As of\nApril 30, 2024, a significant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the technology industry or\nsector. The components of the Underlying Index\nare likely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nS-13\n\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c SPDJI \u201d ), which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and publishes information\nregarding the market value of the Underlying\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Equity Securities Risk\n. Equity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue, and their values may be more volatile\nthan those of other asset classes. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of\nreasons that may directly relate to the issuer\nas well as due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe S-14 Fund invests may cause disruptions\nthat negatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions.

The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-16\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-17\n\niSHARES \u00ae MORNINGSTAR GROWTH ETF Ticker: ILCG\nStock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective\nThe iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (the \u201c Fund\n\u201d ) seeks to track the investment results of\nan index composed of large- and mid-\ncapitalization U.S. equities that exhibit\ngrowth characteristics. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.04%     None       0.00%       0.04%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $4          $13      $23       $51  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 19% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae US Large-Mid Cap Broad\nGrowth Index SM (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ),\nwhich measures the performance of U.S. stocks\nissued by \u201c large-mid capitalization \u201d\ncompanies that have exhibited above-average \u201c\ngrowth \u201d characteristics as determined by\nMorningstar, Inc. ( \u201c Morningstar \u201d or the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d ). Morningstar defines \u201c\nlarge-mid capitalization \u201d stocks as those\nstocks that form approximately the top 90% of\nthe market capitalization of the stocks\neligible to be included in the Morningstar \u00ae\nUS Market Extended Index SM (a diversified\nbroad market index that represents\napproximately 99.5% of the market\ncapitalization of publicly traded U.S. stocks\nand includes only those stocks in the top 75%\nof companies in the investable universe based\non a liquidity score of the Index Provider).\nThe Index Provider then designates stocks as \u201c\nblend, \u201d \u201c growth \u201d or \u201c value \u201d based on\ntheir style orientations. The stocks in the\nUnderlying Index are designated as \u201c growth \u201d\nbecause they are issued by companies that\ntypically have higher than average historical\nand forecasted earnings, sales, book value and\ncash flow growth. The stocks in the Underlying\nIndex are weighted according to the total\nvalue of shares that are publicly owned and\navailable for investment. As of April 30,\n2024, a significant portion of the Underlying\nIndex is represented by securities of\ncompanies in the industrials and technology\nindustries or sectors. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. S-18\n\nIndexing may eliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially outperform the\nUnderlying Index but also may reduce some of\nthe risks of active management, such as poor\nsecurity selection. Indexing seeks to achieve\nlower costs and better after-tax performance\nby aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Growth Securities Risk . Growth\nsecurities are those issued by companies whose\nearnings growth potential appears to be\ngreater than the market in general and whose\nrevenue growth is expected to continue for an\nextended period of time. The prices of growth\nsecurities may be more volatile than those of\nother types of investments and can decline\nrapidly and significantly in reaction to\nnegative news. Growth securities may\nunderperform value securities and other types\nof assets as well as the overall stock market.\nGrowth securities may go in and out of favor\nover time, which could affect the performance\nof the Fund. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. S-19\nAsset Class Risk. The securities and other\nassets in the Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Industrial\nCompanies Risk. Industrial companies face a\nnumber of risks, including supply chain and\ndistribution disruptions, business\ninterruptions, product obsolescence, third-\nparty vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Non-\nDiversification Risk . The Fund is classified\nas \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means that,\ncompared with funds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a greater\npercentage of its assets in securities or\nother instruments representing a small number\nof issuers or counterparties and thus may be\nmore susceptible to the risks associated with\nthese particular issuers or counterparties. As\na result, the Fund's performance may depend to\na greater extent on the performance of a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties, which may\nlead to more volatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have S-20 limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions.

Index returns beginning on March\n22, 2021 reflect the performance of the\nMorningstar US Large-Mid Cap Broad Growth\nIndex, which, effective as of March 22, 2021,\nreplaced the Morningstar US Large Growth Index\nas the Underlying Index of the Fund. After-tax\nreturns in the table above are calculated\nusing the historical highest individual U.S.\nfederal marginal income tax rates and do not\nreflect the impact of state or local taxes.\nActual after-tax returns depend on an\ninvestor\u2019s tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown, and after-tax returns shown are\nnot relevant to tax-exempt investors or\ninvestors who hold shares through tax-deferred\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-22\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-23\n\niSHARES \u00ae MORNINGSTAR MID-CAP ETF Ticker: IMCB\nStock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective\nThe iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap ETF (the \u201c\nFund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment results\nof an index composed of mid-capitalization\nU.S. equities.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $4          $13      $23       $51  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 26% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae US Mid Cap Index SM (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which measures the\nperformance of U.S. stocks issued by mid-\ncapitalization companies that have exhibited\nboth \u201c growth \u201d and \u201c value \u201d characteristics\nas determined by Morningstar, Inc. ( \u201c\nMorningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ).\nMorningstar defines \u201c mid-capitalization \u201d\nstocks as those stocks that generally fall\nbetween the 70th and 90th percentile of the\nmarket capitalization of the stocks eligible\nto be included in the Morningstar \u00ae US Market\nExtended Index SM (a diversified broad market\nindex that represents approximately 99.5% of\nthe market capitalization of publicly traded\nU.S. stocks and includes only those stocks of\nthe top 75% of companies in the investable\nuniverse based on a liquidity score of the\nIndex Provider). The Index Provider then\ndesignates stocks as \u201c blend, \u201d \u201c growth \u201d or\n\u201c value \u201d based on their style orientations.\nStocks of companies with, for example,\nrelatively higher average historical and\nforecasted earnings, sales, book value and\ncash flow growth would be designated as \u201c\ngrowth \u201d securities. Stocks of companies with,\nfor example, relatively low valuations based\non price-to-book ratios, price-to-earnings\nratios and other factors are designated as \u201c\nvalue \u201d securities. Stocks that exhibit both\ngrowth and value characteristics are\ndesignated as \u201c blend \u201d securities and are\nincluded in the Underlying Index. The stocks\nin the Underlying Index are weighted according\nto the total value of shares that are publicly\nowned and available for investment. As of\nApril 30, 2024, a significant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the industrials and technology\nindustries or sectors. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. S-24\n\nBFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Mid-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk . Compared to large-\ncapitalization companies, mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be less stable and more\nsusceptible to adverse developments. The\nsecurities of mid-capitalization companies may\nbe more volatile and less liquid than those of\nlarge-capitalization companies. As a result,\nthe Fund\u2019s share price may be more volatile\nthan that of a fund with a greater investment\nin large-capitalization stocks. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. S-25 Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Growth Securities\nRisk . Growth securities are those issued by\ncompanies whose earnings growth potential\nappears to be greater than the market in\ngeneral and whose revenue growth is expected\nto continue for an extended period of time.\nThe prices of growth securities may be more\nvolatile than those of other types of\ninvestments and can decline rapidly and\nsignificantly in reaction to negative news.\nGrowth securities may underperform value\nsecurities and other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market. Growth securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of the Fund.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of S-26 the Underlying\nIndex. Tracking error may occur due to a\nnumber of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Value Securities Risk .\nValue securities are those issued by companies\nthat may be perceived as undervalued. Such\nsecurities may decline in price or fail to\nappreciate for long periods of time, and they\nmay never realize their full potential value.\nValue securities may underperform growth\nsecurities and other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market. Value securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of the Fund. S-27\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Index returns beginning on March 22,\n2021 reflect the performance of the\nMorningstar US Mid Cap Index, which, effective\nas of March 22, 2021, replaced the Morningstar\nUS Mid Core Index as the Underlying Index of\nthe Fund. After-tax returns in the table above\nare calculated using the historical highest\nindividual U.S. federal marginal income tax\nrates and do not reflect the impact of state\nor local taxes. Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-28\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-29\n\niSHARES \u00ae MORNINGSTAR MID-CAP GROWTH ETF\nTicker: IMCG Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca\nInvestment Objective The iShares Morningstar\nMid-Cap Growth ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to\ntrack the investment results of an index\ncomposed of mid-capitalization U.S. equities\nthat exhibit growth characteristics.

Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $6          $19      $34       $77  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 34% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae US Mid Cap Broad Growth\nIndex SM (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which\nmeasures the performance of U.S. stocks issued\nby mid-capitalization companies that have\nexhibited above-average \u201c growth \u201d\ncharacteristics as determined by Morningstar,\nInc. ( \u201c Morningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d ). Morningstar defines \u201c mid-capitalization\n\u201d stocks as those stocks that generally fall\nbetween the 70th and 90th percentile of the\nmarket capitalization of the stocks eligible\nto be included in the Morningstar \u00ae US Market\nExtended Index SM (a diversified broad market\nindex that represents approximately 99.5% of\nthe market capitalization of publicly traded\nU.S. stocks and includes only those stocks of\nthe top 75% of companies in the investable\nuniverse based on a liquidity score of the\nIndex Provider). The Index Provider then\ndesignates stocks as \u201c blend, \u201d \u201c growth \u201d or\n\u201c value \u201d based on their style orientations.\nThe stocks in the Underlying Index are\ndesignated as \u201c growth \u201d because they are\nissued by companies that typically have higher\nthan average historical and forecasted\nearnings, sales, book value and cash flow\ngrowth. The stocks in the Underlying Index are\nweighted according to the total value of\nshares that are publicly owned and available\nfor investment. As of April 30, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nindustrials and technology industries or\nsectors. The components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over time. BFA uses\nan indexing approach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund does not try to\n\u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. S-30\n\nIndexing may eliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially outperform the\nUnderlying Index but also may reduce some of\nthe risks of active management, such as poor\nsecurity selection. Indexing seeks to achieve\nlower costs and better after-tax performance\nby aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Mid-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk . Compared to large-\ncapitalization companies, mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be less stable and more\nsusceptible to adverse developments. The\nsecurities of mid-capitalization companies may\nbe more volatile and less liquid than those of\nlarge-capitalization companies. As a result,\nthe Fund\u2019s share price may be more volatile\nthan that of a fund with a greater investment\nin large-capitalization stocks. Growth\nSecurities Risk . Growth securities are those\nissued by companies whose earnings growth\npotential appears to be greater than the\nmarket in general and whose revenue growth is\nexpected to continue for an extended period of\ntime. The prices of growth securities may be\nmore volatile than those of other types of\ninvestments and can decline rapidly and\nsignificantly in reaction to negative news.\nGrowth securities may underperform value\nsecurities and other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market. Growth securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of the Fund.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. S-31\nAsset Class Risk. The securities and other\nassets in the Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Industrial\nCompanies Risk. Industrial companies face a\nnumber of risks, including supply chain and\ndistribution disruptions, business\ninterruptions, product obsolescence, third-\nparty vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and S-32 other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-33\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Index returns beginning on March\n22, 2021 reflect the performance of the\nMorningstar US Mid Cap Broad Growth Index,\nwhich, effective as of March 22, 2021,\nreplaced the Morningstar US Mid Growth Index\nas the Underlying Index of the Fund. After-tax\nreturns in the table above are calculated\nusing the historical highest individual U.S.\nfederal marginal income tax rates and do not\nreflect the impact of state or local taxes.\nActual after-tax returns depend on an\ninvestor\u2019s tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown, and after-tax returns shown are\nnot relevant to tax-exempt investors or\ninvestors who hold shares through tax-deferred\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-34\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-35\n\niSHARES \u00ae MORNINGSTAR MID-CAP VALUE ETF\nTicker: IMCV Stock Exchange: Nasdaq Investment\nObjective The iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap\nValue ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the\ninvestment results of an index composed of\nmid-capitalization U.S. equities that exhibit\nvalue characteristics. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $6          $19      $34       $77  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 43% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae US Mid Cap Broad Value Index\nSM (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which measures\nthe performance of U.S. stocks issued by mid-\ncapitalization companies that have exhibited \u201c\nvalue \u201d characteristics as determined by\nMorningstar, Inc. ( \u201c Morningstar \u201d or the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d ). Morningstar defines \u201c mid-\ncapitalization \u201d stocks as those stocks that\ngenerally fall between the 70th and 90th\npercentile of the market capitalization of the\nstocks eligible to be included in the\nMorningstar \u00ae US Market Extended Index SM (a\ndiversified broad market index that represents\napproximately 99.5% of the market\ncapitalization of publicly traded U.S. stocks\nand includes only those stocks of the top 75%\nof companies in the investable universe based\non a liquidity score of the Index Provider).\nThe Index Provider then designates stocks as \u201c\nblend, \u201d \u201c growth \u201d or \u201c value \u201d based on\ntheir style orientations. The stocks in the\nUnderlying Index are designated as \u201c value \u201d\nbecause they are issued by companies that\ntypically have relatively low valuations based\non price-to-earnings, price-to-book value,\nprice-to-sales, price-to-cash flow and\ndividend yields. The stocks in the Underlying\nIndex are weighted according to the total\nvalue of shares that are publicly owned and\navailable for investment. As of April 30,\n2024, a significant portion of the Underlying\nIndex is represented by securities of\ncompanies in the financial services and\nindustrials industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. S-36\n\nIndexing may eliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially outperform the\nUnderlying Index but also may reduce some of\nthe risks of active management, such as poor\nsecurity selection. Indexing seeks to achieve\nlower costs and better after-tax performance\nby aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Mid-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk . Compared to large-\ncapitalization companies, mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be less stable and more\nsusceptible to adverse developments. The\nsecurities of mid-capitalization companies may\nbe more volatile and less liquid than those of\nlarge-capitalization companies. As a result,\nthe Fund\u2019s share price may be more volatile\nthan that of a fund with a greater investment\nin large-capitalization stocks. Value\nSecurities Risk . Value securities are those\nissued by companies that may be perceived as\nundervalued. Such securities may decline in\nprice or fail to appreciate for long periods\nof time, and they may never realize their full\npotential value. Value securities may\nunderperform growth securities and other types\nof assets as well as the overall stock market.\nValue securities may go in and out of favor\nover time, which could affect the performance\nof the Fund. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in S-37 comparison\nto financial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to S-38\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-39\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

After-tax\nreturns in the table above are calculated\nusing the historical highest individual U.S.\nfederal marginal income tax rates and do not\nreflect the impact of state or local taxes.\nActual after-tax returns depend on an\ninvestor\u2019s tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown, and after-tax returns shown are\nnot relevant to tax-exempt investors or\ninvestors who hold shares through tax-deferred\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-40\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-41\n\niSHARES \u00ae MORNINGSTAR SMALL-CAP ETF Ticker:\nISCB Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment\nObjective The iShares Morningstar Small-Cap\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the\ninvestment results of an index composed of\nsmall-capitalization U.S. equities. Fees and\nExpenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. You may pay other\nfees, such as brokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries, which are\nnot reflected in the tables and examples\nbelow.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.04%     None       0.00%       0.04%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $4          $13      $23       $51  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 28% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae US Small Cap Extended Index\nSM (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which measures\nthe performance of U.S. stocks issued by\nsmall-capitalization companies that have\nexhibited both \u201c growth \u201d and \u201c value \u201d\ncharacteristics as determined by Morningstar,\nInc. ( \u201c Morningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d ). Morningstar defines \u201c small-\ncapitalization \u201d stocks as those stocks that\ngenerally fall between the 90th and 99.5th\npercentile of the market capitalization of the\nstocks eligible to be included in the\nMorningstar \u00ae US Market Extended Index SM (a\ndiversified broad market index that represents\napproximately 99.5% of the market\ncapitalization of publicly traded U.S. stocks\nand includes only those stocks of the top 75%\nof companies in the investable universe based\non a liquidity score of the Index Provider).\nThe largest company in the Underlying Index of\nthe Fund as of April 30, 2024 had a market\ncapitalization of $15.71 billion. The Index\nProvider then designates stocks as \u201c blend, \u201d\n\u201c growth \u201d or \u201c value \u201d based on their style\norientations. Stocks of companies with, for\nexample, relatively higher average historical\nand forecasted earnings, sales, book value and\ncash flow growth would be designated as \u201c\ngrowth \u201d securities. Stocks of companies with,\nfor example, relatively low valuations based\non price-to-book ratios, price-to-earnings\nratios and other factors are designated as \u201c\nvalue \u201d securities. Stocks that exhibit both\ngrowth and value characteristics are\ndesignated as \u201c blend \u201d securities and are\nincluded in the Underlying Index. The stocks\nin the Underlying Index are weighted according\nto the total value of shares that are publicly\nowned and available for investment. As of\nApril 30, 2024, a significant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the financials, healthcare,\nand industrials industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. S-42\n\nBFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Small-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk . Compared to mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies, small-capitalization\ncompanies may be less stable and more\nsusceptible to adverse developments. The\nsecurities of small-capitalization companies\nmay be more volatile and less liquid than\nthose of mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies. As a result, the Fund\u2019s share price\nmay be more volatile than that of a fund with\na greater investment in large- or mid-\ncapitalization stocks. Equity Securities Risk\n. Equity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue, and their values may be more volatile\nthan those of other asset classes. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of\nreasons that may directly relate to the issuer\nas well as due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. S-43 Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nGrowth Securities Risk . Growth securities are\nthose issued by companies whose earnings\ngrowth potential appears to be greater than\nthe market in general and whose revenue growth\nis expected to continue for an extended period\nof time. The prices of growth securities may\nbe more volatile than those of other types of\ninvestments and can decline rapidly and\nsignificantly in reaction to negative news.\nGrowth securities may underperform value\nsecurities and other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market. Growth securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of the Fund.\nHealthcare Companies Risk . The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, the\nprotection and expiration of patents, limited\nproduct lines, supply chain issues, labor\nshortages and product liability claims, among\nother factors. Industrial Companies Risk.\nIndustrial companies face a number of risks,\nincluding supply chain and distribution\ndisruptions, business interruptions, product\nobsolescence, third-party vendor risks, cyber\nattacks, trade disputes, product recalls,\nliability claims, scarcity of materials or\nparts, excess capacity, changes in consumer\npreferences, and volatility in commodity\nprices and currencies. The performance of such\ncompanies may also be affected by\ntechnological developments, labor relations,\nlegislative and regulatory changes, government\nspending policies, and changes in domestic and\ninternational economies. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other S-44 assets\nheld in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Value Securities Risk .\nValue securities are those issued by companies\nthat may be perceived as undervalued. Such\nsecurities may decline in price or fail to\nappreciate for long periods of time, and they\nmay never realize their full potential value.\nValue securities may underperform growth\nsecurities and other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market. Value securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of the Fund. S-45\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Index returns beginning on March\n22, 2021 reflect the performance of the\nMorningstar US Small Cap Extended Index,\nwhich, effective as of March 22, 2021,\nreplaced the Morningstar US Small Core Index\nas the Underlying Index of the Fund. After-tax\nreturns in the table above are calculated\nusing the historical highest individual U.S.\nfederal marginal income tax rates and do not\nreflect the impact of state or local taxes.\nActual after-tax returns depend on an\ninvestor\u2019s tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown, and after-tax returns shown are\nnot relevant to tax-exempt investors or\ninvestors who hold shares through tax-deferred\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-46\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-47\n\niSHARES \u00ae MORNINGSTAR SMALL-CAP GROWTH ETF\nTicker: ISCG Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca\nInvestment Objective The iShares Morningstar\nSmall-Cap Growth ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to\ntrack the investment results of an index\ncomposed of small-capitalization U.S. equities\nthat exhibit growth characteristics.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $6          $19      $34       $77  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 44% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae US Small Cap Broad Growth\nExtended Index SM (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ),\nwhich measures the performance of U.S. stocks\nissued by small-capitalization companies that\nhave exhibited above-average \u201c growth \u201d\ncharacteristics as determined by Morningstar,\nInc. ( \u201c Morningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d ). Morningstar defines \u201c small-\ncapitalization \u201d stocks as those stocks that\ngenerally fall between the 90th and 99.5th\npercentile of the market capitalization of the\nstocks eligible to be included in the\nMorningstar \u00ae US Market Extended Index SM (a\ndiversified broad market index that represents\napproximately 99.5% of the market\ncapitalization of publicly traded U.S. stocks\nand includes only those stocks of the top 75%\nof companies in the investable universe based\non a liquidity score of the Index Provider).\nThe largest company in the Underlying Index of\nthe Fund as of April 30, 2024 had a market\ncapitalization of $15.71 billion. The Index\nProvider then designates stocks as \u201c blend, \u201d\n\u201c growth \u201d or \u201c value \u201d based on their style\norientations. The stocks in the Underlying\nIndex are designated as \u201c growth \u201d because\nthey are issued by companies that typically\nhave higher than average historical and\nforecasted earnings, sales, book value and\ncash flow growth. The stocks in the Underlying\nIndex are weighted according to the total\nvalue of shares that are publicly owned and\navailable for investment. As of April 30,\n2024, a significant portion of the Underlying\nIndex is represented by securities of\ncompanies in the healthcare, industrials, and\ntechnology industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek S-48\n\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Small-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk . Compared to mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies, small-capitalization\ncompanies may be less stable and more\nsusceptible to adverse developments. The\nsecurities of small-capitalization companies\nmay be more volatile and less liquid than\nthose of mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies. As a result, the Fund\u2019s share price\nmay be more volatile than that of a fund with\na greater investment in large- or mid-\ncapitalization stocks. Growth Securities Risk\n. Growth securities are those issued by\ncompanies whose earnings growth potential\nappears to be greater than the market in\ngeneral and whose revenue growth is expected\nto continue for an extended period of time.\nThe prices of growth securities may be more\nvolatile than those of other types of\ninvestments and can decline rapidly and\nsignificantly in reaction to negative news.\nGrowth securities may underperform value\nsecurities and other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market. Growth securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of the Fund.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider S-49 or a third-\nparty data provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Healthcare\nCompanies Risk . The profitability of\nhealthcare companies may be adversely affected\nby extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, the\nprotection and expiration of patents, limited\nproduct lines, supply chain issues, labor\nshortages and product liability claims, among\nother factors. Industrial Companies Risk.\nIndustrial companies face a number of risks,\nincluding supply chain and distribution\ndisruptions, business interruptions, product\nobsolescence, third-party vendor risks, cyber\nattacks, trade disputes, product recalls,\nliability claims, scarcity of materials or\nparts, excess capacity, changes in consumer\npreferences, and volatility in commodity\nprices and currencies. The performance of such\ncompanies may also be affected by\ntechnological developments, labor relations,\nlegislative and regulatory changes, government\nspending policies, and changes in domestic and\ninternational economies. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTechnology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or S-50 impairment of those rights.\nTechnology companies may face increased\ngovernment scrutiny and may be subject to\nadverse government or legal action. Tracking\nError Risk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c\ntracking error, \u201d which is the divergence of\nthe Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions.

Index returns beginning on March\n22, 2021 reflect the performance of the\nMorningstar US Small Cap Broad Growth Extended\nIndex, which, effective as of March 22, 2021,\nreplaced the Morningstar US Small Growth Index\nas the Underlying Index of the Fund. After-tax\nreturns in the table above are calculated\nusing the historical highest individual U.S.\nfederal marginal income tax rates and do not\nreflect the impact of state or local taxes.\nActual after-tax returns depend on an\ninvestor\u2019s tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown, and after-tax returns shown are\nnot relevant to tax-exempt investors or\ninvestors who hold shares through tax-deferred\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-52\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-53\n\niSHARES \u00ae MORNINGSTAR SMALL-CAP VALUE ETF\nTicker: ISCV Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca\nInvestment Objective The iShares Morningstar\nSmall-Cap Value ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to\ntrack the investment results of an index\ncomposed of small-capitalization U.S. equities\nthat exhibit value characteristics.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $6          $19      $34       $77  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 45% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae US Small Cap Broad Value\nExtended Index SM (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ),\nwhich measures the performance of U.S. stocks\nissued by small-capitalization companies that\nhave exhibited above-average \u201c value \u201d\ncharacteristics as determined by Morningstar,\nInc. ( \u201c Morningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d ). Morningstar defines \u201c small\ncapitalization \u201d stocks as those stocks that\ngenerally fall between the 90th and 99.5th\npercentile of the market capitalization of the\nstocks eligible to be included in the\nMorningstar \u00ae US Market Extended Index SM (a\ndiversified broad market index that represents\napproximately 99.5% of the market\ncapitalization of publicly traded U.S. stocks\nand includes only those stocks of the top 75%\nof companies in the investable universe based\non a liquidity score of the Index Provider).\nThe largest company in the Underlying Index of\nthe Fund as of April 30, 2024 had a market\ncapitalization of $12.86 billion. The Index\nProvider then designates stocks as \u201c blend, \u201d\n\u201c growth \u201d or \u201c value \u201d based on their style\norientations. The stocks in the Underlying\nIndex are designated as \u201c value \u201d because they\nare issued by companies that typically have\nrelatively low valuations based on price-to\nearnings, price-to-book value, price-to sales,\nprice-to-cash flow and dividend yields. The\nstocks in the Underlying Index are weighted\naccording to the total value of shares that\nare publicly owned and available for\ninvestment. As of April 30, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nconsumer cyclical and financial services\nindustries or sectors. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the S-54\n\nFund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it\ntracks and does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Small-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk . Compared to mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies, small-capitalization\ncompanies may be less stable and more\nsusceptible to adverse developments. The\nsecurities of small-capitalization companies\nmay be more volatile and less liquid than\nthose of mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies. As a result, the Fund\u2019s share price\nmay be more volatile than that of a fund with\na greater investment in large- or mid-\ncapitalization stocks. Value Securities Risk .\nValue securities are those issued by companies\nthat may be perceived as undervalued. Such\nsecurities may decline in price or fail to\nappreciate for long periods of time, and they\nmay never realize their full potential value.\nValue securities may underperform growth\nsecurities and other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market. Value securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of the Fund.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider S-55 to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Consumer goods and\nservices companies ( \u201c consumer companies \u201d )\nface risks related to changes in consumer\npreferences and disposable income, commodity\nprices, government regulation, supply chain\ndisruptions, damage to brand or reputation,\neconomic slowdown and labor shortages, among\nother things. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nIssuer Risk . The performance of the Fund\ndepends on the performance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to which the Fund\nhas exposure. The value of securities or other\nassets may decline, or perform differently\nfrom the market as a whole, due to changes in\nthe financial condition or credit rating of\nthe issuer or counterparty. Management Risk .\nThe Fund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund S-56 to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment; portfolio transactions carried out\nto minimize the distribution of capital gains\nto shareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions.

The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Index returns\nbeginning on March 22, 2021 reflect the\nperformance of the Morningstar US Small Cap\nBroad Value Extended Index. After-tax returns\nin the table above are calculated using the\nhistorical highest individual U.S. federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state or local taxes. Actual\nafter-tax returns depend on an investor\u2019s tax\nsituation and may differ from those shown, and\nafter-tax returns shown are not relevant to\ntax-exempt investors or investors who hold\nshares through tax-deferred arrangements, such\nas 401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ). Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares are calculated assuming that an\ninvestor has sufficient capital gains of the\nsame character from other investments to\noffset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-58\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-59\n\niSHARES \u00ae MORNINGSTAR U.S. EQUITY ETF Ticker:\nILCB Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment\nObjective The iShares Morningstar U.S. Equity\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the\ninvestment results of an index composed of\nlarge- and mid-capitalization U.S. equities.\nFees and Expenses The following table\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you will\nincur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $3          $10      $17       $39  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 5% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae US Large-Mid Cap Index SM\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which measures\nthe performance of U.S. stocks issued by\nlarge-mid capitalization companies that have\nexhibited similar \u201c growth \u201d and \u201c value \u201d\ncharacteristics, as determined by Morningstar,\nInc. ( \u201c Morningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d ). Morningstar defines \u201c large-mid\ncapitalization \u201d stocks as those stocks that\nform approximately the top 90% of the market\ncapitalization of the stocks eligible to be\nincluded in the Morningstar \u00ae US Market\nExtended Index SM (a diversified broad market\nindex that represents approximately 99.5% of\nthe market capitalization of publicly traded\nU.S. stocks and includes only those stocks of\nthe top 75% of companies in the investable\nuniverse based on a liquidity score of the\nIndex Provider). The Index Provider then\ndesignates stocks as \u201c blend, \u201d \u201c growth \u201d or\n\u201c value \u201d based on their style orientations.\nStocks of companies with, for example,\nrelatively higher than average historical and\nforecasted earnings, sales, book value and\ncash flow growth are designated as \u201c growth \u201d\nsecurities. Stocks of companies with, for\nexample, relatively low valuations based on\nprice-to-book ratios, price-to-earnings ratios\nand other factors are designated as \u201c value \u201d\nsecurities. Stocks that exhibit both growth\nand value characteristics are designated as \u201c\nblend \u201d securities and are included in the\nUnderlying Index. The stocks in the Underlying\nIndex are weighted according to the total\nvalue of shares that are publicly owned and\navailable for investment. As of April 30,\n2024, a significant portion of the Underlying\nIndex is represented by securities of\ncompanies in the industrials and technology\nindustries or sectors. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. S-60\n\nBFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. S-61 Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Growth Securities\nRisk . Growth securities are those issued by\ncompanies whose earnings growth potential\nappears to be greater than the market in\ngeneral and whose revenue growth is expected\nto continue for an extended period of time.\nThe prices of growth securities may be more\nvolatile than those of other types of\ninvestments and can decline rapidly and\nsignificantly in reaction to negative news.\nGrowth securities may underperform value\nsecurities and other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market. Growth securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of the Fund.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, product obsolescence,\nthird-party vendor risks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls, liability claims,\nscarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe performance of such companies may also be\naffected by technological developments, labor\nrelations, legislative and regulatory changes,\ngovernment spending policies, and changes in\ndomestic and international economies. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual securities or\nother assets to which the Fund has exposure.\nThe value of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Technology Companies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel. These companies\ntypically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. S-62 Technology\ncompanies also depend heavily on intellectual\nproperty rights and may be adversely affected\nby the loss or impairment of those rights.\nTechnology companies may face increased\ngovernment scrutiny and may be subject to\nadverse government or legal action. Tracking\nError Risk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c\ntracking error, \u201d which is the divergence of\nthe Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Value Securities Risk .\nValue securities are those issued by companies\nthat may be perceived as undervalued. Such\nsecurities may decline in price or fail to\nappreciate for long periods of time, and they\nmay never realize their full potential value.\nValue securities may underperform growth\nsecurities and other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market. Value securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of the Fund. S-63\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

After-tax\nreturns in the table above are calculated\nusing the historical highest individual U.S.\nfederal marginal income tax rates and do not\nreflect the impact of state or local taxes.\nActual after-tax returns depend on an\ninvestor\u2019s tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown, and after-tax returns shown are\nnot relevant to tax-exempt investors or\ninvestors who hold shares through tax-deferred\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-64\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund.

Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-65\n\niSHARES \u00ae MORNINGSTAR VALUE ETF Ticker: ILCV\nStock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective\nThe iShares Morningstar Value ETF (the \u201c Fund\n\u201d ) seeks to track the investment results of\nan index composed of large- and mid-\ncapitalization U.S. equities that exhibit\nvalue characteristics.

You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.04%     None       0.00%       0.04%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $4          $13      $23       $51  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 22% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Morningstar \u00ae US Large-Mid Cap Broad Value\nIndex SM (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which\nmeasures the performance of U.S. stocks issued\nby large-mid capitalization companies that\nhave exhibited above-average \u201c value \u201d\ncharacteristics as determined by Morningstar,\nInc. ( \u201c Morningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d ). Morningstar defines \u201c large-mid\ncapitalization \u201d stocks as those stocks that\nform approximately the top 90% of the market\ncapitalization of the stocks eligible to be\nincluded in the Morningstar \u00ae US Market\nExtended Index SM (a diversified broad market\nindex that represents approximately 99.5% of\nthe market capitalization of publicly traded\nU.S. stocks and includes only those stocks of\nthe top 75% of companies in the investable\nuniverse based on a liquidity score of the\nIndex Provider). The Index Provider then\ndesignates stocks as \u201c blend, \u201d \u201c growth \u201d or\n\u201c value \u201d based on their style orientations.\nThe stocks in the Underlying Index are\ndesignated as \u201c value \u201d because they are\nissued by companies that typically have\nrelatively low valuations based on price-to-\nearnings, price-to-book value, price-to-sales,\nprice-to-cash flow and dividend yields. The\nstocks in the Underlying Index are weighted\naccording to the total value of shares that\nare publicly owned and available for\ninvestment. As of April 30, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nfinancial services, healthcare, and\nindustrials industries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek S-66\n\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Morningstar, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Value Securities Risk . Value\nsecurities are those issued by companies that\nmay be perceived as undervalued. Such\nsecurities may decline in price or fail to\nappreciate for long periods of time, and they\nmay never realize their full potential value.\nValue securities may underperform growth\nsecurities and other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market. Value securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of the Fund.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider S-67 to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nHealthcare Companies Risk . The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, the\nprotection and expiration of patents, limited\nproduct lines, supply chain issues, labor\nshortages and product liability claims, among\nother factors. Industrial Companies Risk.\nIndustrial companies face a number of risks,\nincluding supply chain and distribution\ndisruptions, business interruptions, product\nobsolescence, third-party vendor risks, cyber\nattacks, trade disputes, product recalls,\nliability claims, scarcity of materials or\nparts, excess capacity, changes in consumer\npreferences, and volatility in commodity\nprices and currencies. The performance of such\ncompanies may also be affected by\ntechnological developments, labor relations,\nlegislative and regulatory changes, government\nspending policies, and changes in domestic and\ninternational economies. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may S-68 lose\nmoney because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a decline in the\nvalue of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. Tracking Error Risk\n. The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking error,\n\u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-69\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Index returns beginning on March\n22, 2021 reflect the performance of the\nMorningstar US Large-Mid Cap Broad Value\nIndex, which, effective as of March 22, 2021,\nreplaced the Morningstar US Large Value Index\nas the Underlying Index of the Fund. After-tax\nreturns in the table above are calculated\nusing the historical highest individual U.S.\nfederal marginal income tax rates and do not\nreflect the impact of state or local taxes.\nActual after-tax returns depend on an\ninvestor\u2019s tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown, and after-tax returns shown are\nnot relevant to tax-exempt investors or\ninvestors who hold shares through tax-deferred\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-70\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-71\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI KLD 400 SOCIAL ETF Ticker: DSI\nStock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective\nThe iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (the \u201c\nFund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment results\nof an index composed of U.S. companies that\nhave positive environmental, social and\ngovernance characteristics as identified by\nthe index provider. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $26         $80     $141      $318  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 5% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI KLD 400 Social Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which is a free float-\nadjusted market capitalization index designed\nto provide exposure to U.S. companies that\nhave positive environmental, social and\ngovernance ( \u201c ESG \u201d ) characteristics. As of\nApril 30, 2024, the Underlying Index consisted\nof 401 securities identified by MSCI Inc. (the\n\u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ) from the\nuniverse of companies included in the MSCI USA\nIMI Index, which targets 99% of the market\ncoverage of stocks that are listed for trading\non the New York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d )\nand the Nasdaq Stock Market. MSCI analyzes\neach eligible company\u2019s ESG performance using\nproprietary ratings covering ESG criteria.\nWhen selecting companies for the Underlying\nIndex, MSCI also considers market\ncapitalization and liquidity. Companies that\nMSCI determines have significant involvement\nin the following businesses are not eligible\nfor the Underlying Index: fossil fuel\nextraction, fossil fuel reserve ownership,\nunconventional oil and gas extraction, thermal\ncoal-based power generation, alcohol, tobacco,\ngambling, civilian firearms, nuclear power,\ncontroversial weapons, nuclear weapons,\nconventional weapons, adult entertainment and\ngenetically modified organisms. The Underlying\nIndex includes large-, mid- and small-\ncapitalization companies and may change over\ntime. As of April 30, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the technology\nindustry or sector. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. S-72\n\nIndexing may eliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially outperform the\nUnderlying Index but also may reduce some of\nthe risks of active management, such as poor\nsecurity selection. Indexing seeks to achieve\nlower costs and better after-tax performance\nby aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 90% of its\nassets in the component securities of the\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 10% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby MSCI, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Diversification Policy. The Fund\nintends to be diversified in approximately the\nsame proportion as the Underlying Index is\ndiversified. The Fund may become \u201c\nnon\u2011diversified, \u201d as defined in the 1940 Act,\nsolely as a result of a change in relative\nmarket capitalization or index weighting of\none or more constituents of the Underlying\nIndex. Shareholder approval will not be sought\nif the Fund becomes \u201c non\u2011diversified \u201d due\nsolely to a change in the relative market\ncapitalization or index weighting of one or\nmore constituents of the Underlying Index. The\nFund discloses its portfolio holdings and\nweightings at www.iShares.com. Summary of\nPrincipal Risks As with any investment, you\ncould lose all or part of your investment in\nthe Fund, and the Fund's performance could\ntrail that of other investments.The Fund is\nsubject to certain risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below,any of which may\nadversely affect the Fund's net asset value\nper share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), trading price, yield,\ntotal return and ability to meet its\ninvestment objective. Certain key risks are\nprioritized below (with others following in\nalphabetical order), but the relative\nsignificance of any risk is difficult to\npredict and may change over time. You should\nreview each risk factor carefully. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. ESG Risk. To the\nextent that the Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. The Underlying Index\u2019s use\nof ESG criteria may result in the Fund\ninvesting in, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nS-73 assumptions and estimates. Neither the\nFund nor BFA can offer assurances that the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Non-Diversification Risk . To the\nextent the Fund is non-diversified, the Fund\nmay invest a large percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. S-74 Technology Companies Risk .\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources, supply chains and personnel. These\ncompanies typically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-75\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-76\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-77\n\niSHARES \u00ae MSCI USA ESG SELECT ETF Ticker: SUSA\nStock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective\nThe iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (the \u201c\nFund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment results\nof an index composed of U.S. companies that\nhave positive environmental, social and\ngovernance characteristics as identified by\nthe index provider. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.25%     None       0.00%       0.25%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $26         $80     $141      $318  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 16% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe MSCI USA Extended ESG Select Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which is an optimized\nindex designed to maximize exposure to\npositive environmental, social and governance\n( \u201c ESG \u201d ) characteristics, while exhibiting\nrisk and return characteristics similar to the\nMSCI USA Index. As of April 30, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index consisted of 177 securities\nincluded in the MSCI USA Index. MSCI Inc. (the\n\u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ) analyzes each\neligible company\u2019s ESG performance using\nproprietary ratings covering ESG and ethics\ncriteria. The index methodology is designed so\nthat companies with relatively high overall\nratings have a higher representation in the\nUnderlying Index than in the MSCI USA Index\nand companies with relatively low overall\nratings have a lower representation in the\nUnderlying Index than in the MSCI USA Index.\nExceptions may result from the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s objective of having risk and return\ncharacteristics similar to the MSCI USA Index.\nThe Index Provider excludes securities of\ncompanies involved in the business of tobacco,\nalcohol, gambling, nuclear power and weapons,\nfossil fuel extraction, thermal coal power and\nunconventional oil and gas businesses ( e.g .,\nthermal coal extraction and generation or oil\nsands extraction), companies involved with\nconventional and controversial weapons,\nproducers and major retailers of civilian\nfirearms, as well as companies involved in\nvery severe business controversies. The Index\nProvider defines a controversy as an instance\nor ongoing situation in which company\noperations and/or products allegedly have a\nnegative environmental, social and/or\ngovernance impact. Each controversy case is\nassessed for the severity of its impact on\nsociety. The Index Provider generally\nclassifies companies as \u201c involved \u201d in a\nparticular business based on revenue or\npercentage of revenue thresholds ( e.g. , 10%)\nfor certain products and activities in an\nexcluded industry. The securities of certain\ncompanies will be excluded regardless of\nrevenue measures ( e.g. , S-78\n\nall companies involved in the manufacturing of\ncontroversial weapons are excluded). The\nUnderlying Index includes large- and mid-\ncapitalization companies and may change over\ntime. As of April 30, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the technology\nindustry or sector. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 90% of\nits assets in the component securities of the\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 10% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby MSCI, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. ESG Risk. To the\nextent that the Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. The Underlying Index\u2019s use\nof ESG criteria may result in the Fund\ninvesting in, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider may\nevaluate security-level ESG data and, if\napplicable, ESG objectives or constraints that\nare relevant to the Underlying Index only at\nindex reviews or rebalances. Securities\nincluded in the Underlying Index may cease to\nmeet the relevant ESG criteria but may\nnevertheless remain in the Underlying Index\nand the Fund until the next review or\nrebalance by the Index Provider. As a result,\ncertain securities in the Underlying Index, or\nthe Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet\nthe relevant ESG objectives or constraints at\nall times. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. S-79 Index-\nRelated Risk. The Index Provider may rely on\nvarious sources of information to assess the\ncriteria of components of the Underlying\nIndex, including information that may be based\non assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. S-80 Technology Companies Risk .\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources, supply chains and personnel. These\ncompanies typically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences between the\nsecurities and other assets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in the Underlying\nIndex; differences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value securities and\nother assets; transaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; the Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for the Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-81\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

After-tax returns in the table above are\ncalculated using the historical highest\nindividual U.S. federal marginal income tax\nrates and do not reflect the impact of state\nor local taxes. Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-82\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-83\n\nMore Information About the Funds This\nProspectus contains important information\nabout investing in the Funds that are listed\nbelow.

           \nETFs are funds that trade like other publicly\ntraded securities. Shares of each Fund are\nlisted on a national securities exchange and\ntrade in the secondary market at market prices\nthat change throughout the day. The market\nprice for a share of a Fund may be different\nfrom the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. Each Fund\ninvests in a particular segment of the markets\nfor securities and other instruments (as\napplicable) and is designed to be used as part\nof broader asset allocation strategies.\nAccordingly, an investment in a Fund should\nnot constitute a complete investment program.\nAn\n\n1\n\ninvestment in a Fund is not a bank deposit,\nand it is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, any\nother government agency, BFA or any of BFA\u2019s\naffiliates. Index Funds A share of a Fund\nrepresents an ownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of securities and other\ninstruments (as applicable) that is intended\nto track the Fund\u2019s Underlying Index. An index\nis a financial calculation, based on a\ngrouping of financial instruments, and is not\nan investment product, while each Fund is an\nactual investment portfolio. The performance\nof a Fund and that of its Underlying Index may\nvary for a number of reasons, including\ntransaction costs, asset or currency\nvaluations, corporate actions, timing\nvariances and differences between the\ncomposition of a Fund\u2019s portfolio and that of\nthe Underlying Index resulting from the Fund\u2019s\nuse of representative sampling or from legal\nrestrictions (such as diversification\nrequirements) that apply to the Fund but not\nto its Underlying Index. From time to time,\nthe provider of the Underlying Index ( \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ) may make changes to the index\nmethodology or other adjustments to a Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index. Unless otherwise determined\nby BFA, any such change will be reflected in\nthe calculation of the Underlying Index\u2019s\nperformance on a going-forward basis after the\neffective date of such change. Therefore, the\nperformance of the Underlying Index that is\nshown for periods prior to the effective date\nof any such change generally will not be\nrecalculated or restated to reflect the\nchange. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Funds. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of the applicable underlying index.\nBecause the Funds use representative sampling,\nthey can be expected to have a larger tracking\nerror than if they used a replication indexing\nstrategy. \u201c Replication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests in\nsubstantially all of the securities in its\nunderlying index in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying index. 2\n\nAdditional Information About the Funds' Risks\nEach Fund is subject to various risks, any of\nwhich may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV,\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Each Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. You could lose all or part of\nyour investment in a Fund, which could\nunderperform other investments. The table\nbelow identifies the principal and other (non-\nprincipal) risks that apply to each Fund. A\nFund that invests in an Underlying Fund also\nmay be indirectly exposed to these risks\nthrough such investment. A description of each\nrisk is provided after the table.\n                                              \n       iSha\u2026  iSh\u2026  iSha\u2026                     \n       Core\u2026  Cor\u2026

                                   \n                                              \nAsset Class Risk. The securities and other\nassets in a Fund\u2019s portfolio or its Underlying\nIndex may underperform in comparison to other\nindexes that track, or assets that represent,\nother countries or geographic units,\nindustries, markets, market segments, or asset\nclasses. Various types of securities, other\nassets and indexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and underperformance in\ncomparison to financial markets generally.\nThis divergence may be due to a number of\nfactors including, among other things,\ninflation, interest rates, productivity,\nglobal demand for local products or resources,\nand regulation and governmental controls. This\nmay cause a Fund to underperform other\ninvestment vehicles that invest in different\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with a Fund.\nThere are a limited number of institutions\nthat may act as Authorized Participants for\nthe Fund, including on an agency basis on\nbehalf of other market participants. No\nAuthorized Participant is obligated to engage\nin creation or redemption transactions. To the\nextent that Authorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation or\nredemption orders for a Fund and no other\nAuthorized Participant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade at a premium\nor discount to NAV and possibly face trading\nhalts or delisting. Authorized Participant\nconcentration risk may be heightened for a\nFund that invests in securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers or instruments with lower\ntrading volume. Such assets often entail\ngreater settlement and operational complexity\nand higher capital costs for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the number of\nAuthorized Participants that engage with the\nFund. Buyback Risk. A company\u2019s announcement\nof a share buyback strategy may not be an\naccurate predictor of future share\nperformance. A buyback may signal that a\ncompany\u2019s management believes the company\u2019s\nstock price is undervalued, and the company\u2019s\nstock price may rise after a buyback\nannouncement. There is no certainty, however,\nthat management plans to implement a buyback\nstrategy because it believes the stock is\nundervalued. A company could use buybacks for\nother purposes, such as to increase its price-\nto-earnings or other financial ratios, to\nalleviate excessive dilution, to serve as a\ndefensive measure, or to cut its own capital\nexpenditures, which could potentially limit\nfuture growth. In addition, there is no\ncertainty that the market will treat the\ncompany as undervalued. Close-Out Risk for\nQualified Financial Contracts. Regulations\nadopted by global prudential regulators\nrequire counterparties that are part of U.S.\nor foreign global systemically important\nbanking organizations to include contractual\nrestrictions on close-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified financial\ncontracts. Qualified financial contracts\ninclude agreements relating to swaps, currency\nforwards and other derivatives as well as\nrepurchase agreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions prevent a Fund\nfrom closing out a qualified financial\ncontract during a specified time period if the\ncounterparty is subject to resolution\nproceedings and also prohibit a Fund from\nexercising default rights due to a\nreceivership or similar proceeding of an\naffiliate of the counterparty. These\nrequirements may increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. Communication Services\nSector Risk. The communication services sector\nconsists of both companies in the\ntelecommunication services industry as well as\nthose in the media and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the telecommunication\nservices industry group include providers of\nfiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment\n\n6\n\nindustry group encompass a variety of services\nand products including television\nbroadcasting, gaming products, social media,\nnetworking platforms, online classifieds,\nonline review websites, and Internet search\nengines. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may be affected by industry\ncompetition, substantial capital requirements,\ngovernment regulation, and obsolescence of\ncommunications products and services due to\ntechnological advancement. Fluctuating\ndomestic and international demand, shifting\ndemographics and often unpredictable changes\nin consumer tastes can drastically affect a\ncommunication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Concentration Risk. A Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. A Fund with investment concentration\nmay be more adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets, may\nexperience greater price volatility and may be\nmore susceptible to adverse economic, market,\npolitical or regulatory impacts on those\nassets compared to a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments. Consumer Goods\nand Services Companies Risk. Many consumer\ngoods and services companies ( \u201c consumer\ncompanies \u201d ) rely heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending and may\nbe impacted by social trends, marketing\ncampaigns, demographic shifts and other\nfactors affecting consumer preferences and\ndemand. In addition, damage to a brand or a\nreputation crisis can have a substantial\nadverse impact on consumer companies. Certain\nconsumer companies, such as those providing\nmore discretionary goods or services, may\ndepend more on business cycles, overall\neconomic conditions and consumer confidence.\nMany consumer goods and services are subject\nto government regulation and the related\ncompliance costs, and consumer companies also\nface the risk of product liability claims.\nConsumer companies also may be adversely\naffected by volatility in commodity prices,\nsupply chain disruptions and labor shortages.\nCybersecurity Risk. A Fund and entities that\ninteract with the Fund are susceptible to\noperational, information security and related\ncybersecurity risks, both directly and through\ntheir service providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to, a Fund\u2019s\nadviser, distributor, other service providers\n( e.g ., index and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer agents and\nadministrators), counterparties, market\nmakers, Authorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market operators,\nand governmental authorities. Cybersecurity\nrisks are also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in which a Fund\ninvests, which could result in material\nadverse consequences for such issuers and may\ncause the Fund\u2019s investment in such issuers to\nlose value. Cyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or unintentional events.\nThey include, but are not limited to, gaining\nunauthorized access to systems,\nmisappropriating assets or sensitive\ninformation, corrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational disruption.\nGeopolitical tensions may increase the scale\nand sophistication of deliberate attacks,\nparticularly those from nation-states or from\nentities with nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions\nand impact business operations and may result\nin any of the following: financial losses,\ninterference with a Fund\u2019s ability to\ncalculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to trading,\nsubmission of 7 erroneous trades or erroneous\ncreation or redemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service providers to transact\nbusiness, violations of applicable privacy and\nother laws, regulatory fines, penalties,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other legal and\ncompliance expenses. In addition, cyber\nincidents may render records of Fund assets\nand transactions, shareholder ownership of\nFund shares, and other data integral to a\nFund\u2019s functioning inaccessible, inaccurate or\nincomplete. A Fund may incur substantial costs\nin order to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. Each Fund has established business\ncontinuity plans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent, cyber\nincidents. However, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that prevention and\nremediation efforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go undetected.\nFurthermore, a Fund cannot control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and other third\nparties whose activities affect the Fund. A\nFund and its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk. Investing in dividend-paying stocks\ninvolves the risk that such stocks may fall\nout of favor with investors and underperform\nother types of stocks or the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of dividend-paying stocks will not\ndeclare dividends in the future or will reduce\nor eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends), which may adversely affect a Fund\nwith such holdings. In addition, the value of\ndividend-paying stocks can decline when\ninterest rates rise, as fixed-income\ninvestments become more attractive to\ninvestors. Energy Companies Risk. The energy\nsector tends to be closely tied to the\neconomic cycle and can be significantly\naffected by supply-demand dynamics and\nvolatility in commodity prices. Energy\ncompanies also may be adversely affected by\nexchange rate fluctuations, war or other\nconflicts, sanctions, import/export controls,\ndepletion of resources, technological advances\nand labor relations. This sector generally is\nsubject to substantial government regulation,\nand companies may incur significant costs in\ncomplying with environmental and other laws.\nPolicies that promote energy conservation,\nclean energy or the transition to low carbon\nalternatives also may affect the performance\nof energy companies. Energy companies may\ndepend on a relatively small number of\ncustomers, including governmental entities and\nutilities. The exploration and production of\nenergy sources and the development of energy\ninfrastructure often require significant\ncapital expenditures, and companies may face\nhigh interest costs and difficulty in raising\ncapital. Energy companies also may face\nchallenges from operating in countries with a\nhistory of adverse policies or events, such as\nexpropriation, confiscation of assets,\ncorruption, political instability and social\nunrest. The operations of energy companies may\nbe disrupted by events that target or damage\nenergy infrastructure, including cyber or\nother attacks, accidents and natural\ndisasters. Energy companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. The energy sector may\nexperience significant market volatility. For\nexample, Russia's large-scale invasion of\nUkraine in 2022 led to disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nimposed various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. It is impossible to predict the\neffect of current or future sanctions and\nrestrictions, the extent and duration of the\nconflict, and associated disruptions in the\nenergy sector. The effect of these events or\nany related developments could be significant\nand may have a severe adverse effect on a\nFund's performance. Equity Securities Risk.\nEquity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue due to general market or economic\nconditions, perceptions about the markets in\nwhich issuers participate or a number of\nfactors relating to a specific issuer.\nInvestments in equity securities may be more\nvolatile than investments in other asset\nclasses. Equity securities (both common and\npreferred stock) are subordinated to debt\nsecurities in a company\u2019s capital structure,\nand so equity holders are generally subject to\nmore risks, particularly in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Common stock has the\nlowest priority and the greatest risks,\nincluding with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments. ESG Risk. To the extent\nthat a Fund\u2019s Underlying Index uses criteria\nrelated to the ESG characteristics of issuers,\nthis may limit the types and number of\ninvestment opportunities available to the Fund\nand, as a result, the Fund may underperform\nother funds whose underlying index does not\nuse ESG criteria. An Underlying Index\u2019s use of\nESG criteria may result in a Fund investing\nin, or allocating greater weight to,\nsecurities or market sectors that underperform\nthe market as a whole or underperform other\nfunds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the\nuse of representative sampling may result in\ndivergence of a Fund's overall ESG\ncharacteristics or ESG risk from those of the\nUnderlying Index. The Index Provider to such\nUnderlying Index evaluates securities for\ninclusion and/or weighting in the Underlying\nIndex based on ESG criteria and data provided\nby the Index Provider or third parties. The\nIndex Provider\u2019s evaluation of securities\u2019 ESG\ncharacteristics depends on these criteria and\ndata, which may vary by index provider, and no\nassurance can be given that they will be\ncomplete, accurate or current. In addition, an\nIndex Provider may evaluate security-level ESG\ndata (including ratings) and, if applicable,\nESG objectives or constraints that are 8\nrelevant to an Underlying Index only at index\nreviews or rebalances. Securities included in\nan Underlying Index may cease to meet the\nrelevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless\nremain in the Underlying Index and in the Fund\nusing the Underlying Index until the next\nreview or rebalance by the Index Provider. As\na result, certain securities in the Underlying\nIndex, or the Underlying Index as a whole, may\nnot meet the relevant ESG objectives or\nconstraints at all times. If the ESG\nassessment of a security in an Underlying\nIndex or a Fund changes, neither the Fund nor\nBFA accepts any liability in relation to such\nchange. BFA does not monitor securities in an\nUnderlying Index with respect to ESG\nobjectives or constraints applied by the Index\nProvider and is not responsible for changes to\nthe ESG assessment of a security in an\nUnderlying Index between rebalances. In\naddition, BFA does not assess the validity of\nan Index Provider\u2019s evaluation of the ESG\ncharacteristics of securities or the criteria\nand data used in such evaluation. The impacts\nof risks related to ESG investing are likely\nto change over time, and new ESG risks may be\nidentified as further data and information\nregarding ESG factors and impacts become\navailable. In addition, methodologies for ESG\ninvesting continue to develop, and the ESG\nmethodology applied by an Index Provider may\nchange over time. Financial Companies Risk.\nFinancial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation and\nintervention, which may change frequently and\nmay adversely affect their profitability, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and liquid\nassets they must maintain and their size,\namong other things. Financial services\ncompanies also may be significantly affected\nby, among other things, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, credit rating downgrades,\nadverse public perception and exposure\nconcentration. Increased risk-taking by\nfinancial companies may result in greater\noverall risk in the global financial sector.\nCertain events may cause an unusually high\ndegree of volatility in financial markets and\npose the risk of large losses for financial\nservices companies. Financial companies\nfrequently operate with substantial financial\nleverage and are exposed directly to the\ncredit risk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, which also may be leveraged to\nan unknown degree. Financial companies may\nhave significant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties; as a result, a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother financial companies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk may result in\nsignificant negative impacts to companies with\ndirect exposure to the defaulting counterparty\nas well as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financial sector generally.\nGeographic and Security Risks. Issuers in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio may be located in, or\notherwise connected to, parts of the world\naffected by natural disasters, such as severe\nheat, earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic\neruptions, wildfires, droughts, floods,\nhurricanes and tsunamis. In addition, issuers\nmay be impacted by security concerns with\nrespect to a country or region, such as war\nand other types of conflict, terrorism,\nstrained international relations and\nterritorial disputes. Any of these events may\nadversely affect the issuers, markets and\neconomies to which a Fund is exposed, which\nmay adversely affect the value of the Fund.\nGrowth Securities Risk. Growth securities are\nthose issued by companies whose earnings\ngrowth potential appears to be greater than\nthe market in general and whose revenue growth\nis expected to continue for an extended period\nof time. Growth securities may trade at higher\nmultiples of current earnings compared to\nvalue or other stocks, leading to inflated\nprices and thus potentially greater declines\nin market value. The prices of growth\nsecurities may be more volatile than those of\nother types of investments and can decline\nrapidly and significantly in reaction to\nnegative news. Growth securities may\nunderperform value securities and other types\nof assets as well as the overall stock market.\nUnder certain market conditions, growth\nsecurities have performed better during the\nlater stages of economic recovery, although\nthere is no assurance that they will continue\nto do so. Growth securities typically do not\npay a dividend, which can help cushion stock\nprices in market downturns and reduce\npotential losses. Growth securities may go in\nand out of favor over time, which could affect\nthe performance of a Fund with such holdings.\nHealthcare Companies Risk. The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by the following factors, among\nothers: extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, a\nlimited number of products, labor shortages,\nsupply chain issues and industry innovation.\nMany new products in the healthcare sector\nentail significant research and development\nand require regulatory approval, all of which\nmay be long and costly, and such efforts\nultimately may be unsuccessful. Many\nhealthcare companies depend heavily on\nobtaining and defending patents, which can be\ncostly, and may be adversely affected by the\nexpiration of patents. Healthcare companies\nalso are subject to extensive litigation based\non product liability and similar claims.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. A Fund may not\nacquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, a Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nLiquid investments may become illiquid after\npurchase by a Fund, particularly during\nperiods of market turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or instrument that\nis deemed to be liquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long as it is\nheld by a Fund, and any security or instrument\nheld by a Fund may be deemed an illiquid\ninvestment pursuant to a Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent a Fund holds\nilliquid investments, the illiquid investments\nmay reduce the returns of a Fund because a\nFund may be unable to transact at advantageous\ntimes or prices. An investment may be illiquid\ndue to, among other things, the reduced number\nand capacity of traditional market\nparticipants to make a market in securities or\ninstruments or the lack of an active market\nfor such securities or instruments. To the\nextent that a Fund invests in securities or\ninstruments with substantial market and/or\ncredit risk, a Fund will tend to have\nincreased exposure to the risks associated\nwith illiquid investments. Illiquid\ninvestments may be harder to value, especially\nin changing markets. If a Fund is forced to\nsell underlying investments at reduced prices\nor under unfavorable conditions to meet\nredemption requests or for other cash needs, a\nFund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified\nin a rising interest rate environment or other\ncircumstances where 9 redemptions from a Fund\nmay be greater than normal. Other market\nparticipants may be attempting to liquidate\nholdings at the same time as a Fund, causing\nincreased supply of a Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments in the market and contributing to\nilliquid investments risk and downward pricing\npressure. In addition, if a Fund is limited in\nits ability to sell illiquid investments\nduring periods when shareholders are redeeming\ntheir shares, a Fund will need to sell liquid\nsecurities to meet redemption requests and\nilliquid securities will become a larger\nportion of a Fund\u2019s holdings. During periods\nof market volatility, liquidity in the market\nfor a Fund\u2019s shares may be impacted by the\nliquidity in the market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by a Fund,\nwhich could lead to a Fund\u2019s shares trading at\na premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.\nIndex-Related Risk. Each Fund seeks to achieve\na return that corresponds generally to the\nprice and yield performance, before fees and\nexpenses, of its Underlying Index as published\nby the Index Provider. There is no assurance\nthat the Index Provider or its agents will\nconstruct or calculate the Underlying Index\naccurately. While the Index Provider describes\nwhat the Underlying Index is designed to\nachieve, neither the Index Provider nor its\nagents provide any warranty or accept any\nliability regarding the quality, accuracy or\ncompleteness of the Underlying Index or its\nrelated data, and they do not guarantee that\nthe Underlying Index will be in line with the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology. BFA also does\nnot provide any warranty or guarantee against\nthe Index Provider\u2019s or any agent\u2019s errors.\nThe Index Provider may rely on various sources\nof information to assess the criteria of\ncomponents of the Underlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on assumptions\nand estimates. Neither a Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology or sources of information will\nprovide an accurate assessment of included\ncomponents. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of an\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, particularly for indexes that are less\ncommonly used as benchmarks. In addition,\nthere may be heightened risks associated with\nthe adequacy and reliability of information\nabout emerging markets constituents, as such\nmarkets may have less information available or\nless regulatory oversight. Errors related to\nan Underlying Index may negatively or\npositively impact a Fund and its shareholders.\nFor example, if the Underlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund will have\nexposure to such constituents and will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying Index\u2019s other\nconstituents. Shareholders should understand\nthat any gains from an Index Provider\u2019s errors\nwill be kept by the Fund and its shareholders\nand any losses or costs from such errors will\nbe borne by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnusual market conditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural disasters,\npolitical unrest or war) may impact an Index\nProvider or a third-party data provider and\ncould cause the Index Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to an Underlying Index.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. If a\nscheduled rebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that would otherwise be removed\nat the rebalance (due to, for example, changes\nin market capitalization or issuer credit\nratings) may remain, causing the performance\nand constituents of the Underlying Index to\nvary from those expected under normal\nconditions. In addition, to the extent\ncircumstances evolve between periodic index\nreviews and reconstitutions, an Underlying\nIndex may include constituents that do not\nalign with its objective or selection\ncriteria, and the Fund tracking the Underlying\nIndex may be similarly affected. In addition\nto scheduled rebalances, an Index Provider or\nits agents may carry out ad hoc index\nrebalances due to reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market conditions,\ncorporate events, or corrections of errors.\nThe relevant Fund will in turn rebalance its\nportfolio to attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the portfolio and the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund and its\nshareholders will directly bear any\ntransaction costs and market exposure from\nsuch portfolio rebalancing. Therefore, index-\nrelated errors and ad hoc rebalances may\nincrease a Fund\u2019s costs and tracking error.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, third-party vendor\nrisks, cyber attacks, trade disputes, product\nrecalls, liability and environmental damage\nclaims, scarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe products of industrial companies may face\nobsolescence due to technological developments\nand new product introduction. Furthermore,\nchanges in trade restrictions and tariffs as\nwell as broader geopolitical developments\ncould adversely affect industrial companies.\nThese companies also may be significantly\naffected by domestic and international\neconomic conditions, legislative and\nregulatory changes, and labor relations.\nIndustrial companies may depend on public or\nprivate sector financing, which may become\ndifficult to obtain due to government spending\nconstraints or reduced availability of\ncapital. Such companies may be unable to\nprotect their intellectual property rights or\nmay be liable for infringing the intellectual\nproperty rights of others. Issuer Risk. The\nperformance of a Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of a\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or loan Fund\nshares (to secure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party. There can be no\nassurance that any large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment or that the size of a Fund would 10\nbe maintained. Redemptions of a large number\nof Fund shares may adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the extent a Fund\npermits redemptions in cash, these redemptions\nmay force the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material effect on the\nmarket price of Fund shares, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains, and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such tax year. A\nFund also may be required to sell its more\nliquid investments to meet a large redemption,\nin which case the Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile, and more\ndifficult to price. To the extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund shares on the\nsecondary market, such transactions may\naccount for a large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may, therefore,\nhave a material upward or downward effect on\nthe market price of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s performance to the extent\nthat the Fund is delayed in investing new cash\nand is required to maintain a larger cash\nposition than it ordinarily would, diluting\nits investment returns. Management Risk. An\nindex Fund invests in securities or other\nassets included in, or representative of, its\nUnderlying Index, regardless of their\ninvestment merits. Such a Fund may be affected\nby a general decline in market segments\nrelated to its Underlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to invest the\nFund\u2019s assets in defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. Market disruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an adverse effect on a\nFund\u2019s ability to adjust its exposure to the\nrequired levels in order to track its\nUnderlying Index. Because BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy, a\nFund will not fully replicate its Underlying\nIndex and may hold securities or other assets\nnot included in the Underlying Index. As a\nresult, a Fund is subject to the risk that\nBFA\u2019s investment strategy, whose\nimplementation is subject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the intended\nresults. There is no guarantee that a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a high degree of\ncorrelation to those of its Underlying Index\nor that a Fund will achieve its investment\nobjective. Market Risk. A Fund could lose\nmoney over short periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over longer periods\nduring more prolonged market downturns. The\nvalue of a financial instrument or other asset\nmay decline due to changes in general market\nconditions, economic trends or events that are\nnot specifically related to the particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors that affect\none or more issuers, counterparties,\nexchanges, countries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or asset classes.\nLocal, regional or global events such as war,\nacts of terrorism, pandemics or other public\nhealth issues, recessions, the prospect or\noccurrence of a sovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments and could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s NAV. Changes\nin market and economic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all types of\ninstruments and assets. Market Trading Risk. A\nFund faces numerous market trading risks, any\nof which may lead to its shares trading in the\nsecondary market at a premium or discount to\nNAV or to the intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy Fund shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto NAV or sell Fund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a discount to the NAV, you\nmay pay significantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the underlying value\nof the Fund shares. Absence of an Active\nPrimary Market. Although Fund shares are\nlisted for trading on one or more stock\nexchanges, there can be no assurance that an\nactive primary trading market for Fund shares\nwill develop or be maintained by market makers\nor Authorized Participants. Secondary Listing\nRisks. A Fund\u2019s shares may be listed or traded\non U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other\nthan the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing is maintained. Fund shares\nalso may be available to non-U.S. investors\nthrough funds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary receipts. There\ncan be no assurance that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to trade on any such stock exchange\nor in any market or that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to meet the requirements for exchange\nlisting or market trading. A Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe less actively traded in certain markets\nthan in others, and investors are subject to\nthe execution and settlement risks and market\nstandards of the market where they or their\nbroker direct their trades for execution.\nCertain information that is available to\ninvestors who trade Fund shares on a U.S.\nstock exchange during regular U.S. market\nhours may not be available to investors who\ntrade in other markets, which may result in\nsecondary market prices in such markets being\nless efficient. Secondary Market Trading Risk.\nShares of a Fund may trade in the secondary\nmarket at times when the Fund does not accept\norders to create or redeem shares. At such\ntimes, shares may trade in the secondary\nmarket with more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might be experienced at\ntimes when the Fund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities held by a Fund\nmay be traded in markets that close at a\ndifferent time than an exchange on which Fund\nshares are traded. Liquidity in those\nsecurities may be reduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during the time\nwhen the exchange is open but after the\napplicable market closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be wider bid/ask\nspreads on the exchange and a greater premium\nor discount to NAV. In stressed market\nconditions, the market for a Fund\u2019s shares may\nbecome less liquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the markets for the\nFund\u2019s portfolio holdings, and an investor may\nbe unable to sell their Fund shares. Secondary\nmarket trading in Fund shares may be halted by\na stock exchange because of market conditions\nor for other reasons. In times of\nextraordinary market volatility, Fund shares\nmay be subject to trading halts pursuant to \u201c\ncircuit breaker \u201d rules of a stock exchange or\nmarket. If there is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an exchange or\nmarket, an investor may be unable to purchase\nor sell Fund shares. In addition, if trading\nin certain securities or financial instruments\nis restricted, this may disrupt a Fund\u2019s\ncreation/redemption process, affect the price\nat which Fund shares trade in the secondary\nmarket, and result in a Fund being unable to\ntrade certain securities or financial 11\ninstruments. In such circumstances, a Fund may\nbe unable to rebalance its portfolio or\naccurately price its portfolio holdings and\nmay incur substantial trading losses. Shares\nof a Fund, similar to shares of other issuers\nlisted on a stock exchange, may be sold short\nand are therefore subject to the risk of\nincreased volatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short. In addition,\ntrading activity in derivative products based\non a Fund may lead to increased trading volume\nand volatility in the secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares May Trade at\nPrices Other Than NAV . Shares of a Fund trade\non stock exchanges at prices at, above or\nbelow the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. A Fund\u2019s NAV\nis calculated at the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in the market\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings. The\ntrading price of a Fund\u2019s shares fluctuates\nthroughout trading hours based on both market\nsupply of and demand for Fund shares and the\nunderlying value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the trading\nprices of a Fund\u2019s shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant redemption requests,\nor other unusual market conditions However,\nbecause Fund shares can be created and\nredeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or premiums to a\nFund\u2019s NAV are not likely to be sustained over\nthe long term (unlike shares of many closed-\nend funds, which frequently trade at\nappreciable discounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While the\ncreation/redemption feature is designed to\nmake it more likely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock exchanges at\nprices close to the Fund\u2019s next calculated\nNAV, exchange prices are not expected to\ncorrelate exactly with the Fund\u2019s NAV due to\ntiming reasons, supply and demand imbalances\nand other factors. In addition, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers, Authorized\nParticipants, or other market participants,\nand during periods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading prices for\nshares of a Fund that differ significantly\nfrom its NAV. Authorized Participants may be\nless willing to create or redeem a Fund\u2019s\nshares if there is a lack of an active market\nfor such shares or the Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments, which may contribute to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or Selling Fund\nShares. Buying or selling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of costs that\napply to all securities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you will likely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is\nthe difference between what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares (the \u201c bid \u201d\nprice) and the price at which they are willing\nto sell Fund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price). The\nspread varies over time for Fund shares based\non trading volume and market liquidity. It is\ngenerally narrower if a Fund has more trading\nvolume and market liquidity and wider if a\nFund has less trading volume and market\nliquidity. Increased market volatility also\nmay cause wider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other charges that are\nincurred as a result of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in buying or\nselling Fund shares, frequent trading may\ndetract significantly from investment results,\nand an investment in Fund shares may not be\nadvisable for investors who anticipate\nregularly making small investments through a\nbrokerage account. Materials Companies Risk.\nThe materials sector tends to be closely tied\nto the economic cycle and can be significantly\naffected by supply-demand dynamics. Materials\ncompanies may be adversely affected by\ncommodity price volatility, exchange rate\nfluctuations, social and political unrest,\nwar, import and export controls, supply chain\ndisruption, increased competition, depletion\nof resources, technical advances, labor\nrelations, litigation and government\nregulations, among other factors. Materials\ncompanies are at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may incur significant costs in\ncomplying with environmental laws. Mid-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Investments in\nmid-capitalization companies may be riskier,\nless liquid, more volatile and more\nsusceptible to economic, market and industry\nchanges than investments in large-\ncapitalization companies. Mid-capitalization\ncompanies may have more limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources and management\nexperience. As a result, they generally are\nmore vulnerable than large-capitalization\ncompanies to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Mid-capitalization companies may\nhave a shorter business track record, with\nrelatively less information available to\ninvestors. The securities of mid-sized\ncompanies may trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than the securities of larger\ncompanies. Non-Diversification Risk. A Fund\nthat is classified as \u201c non-diversified \u201d may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties,\ncompared with funds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified. \u201d A non-diversified Fund thus may\nbe more susceptible to the risks associated\nwith these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. The gains and losses on such\nholdings may have a greater impact on a non-\ndiversified Fund\u2019s performance than they would\non the performance of a diversified Fund, and\na non-diversified Fund\u2019s NAV may be more\nvolatile. Operational Risk. Each Fund is\nexposed to operational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited\nto, human error, processing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders, counterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures. Each Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. 12 Real Estate\nCompanies Risk. Real estate companies, which\ninclude real estate investment trusts, real\nestate holding and operating companies, and\nreal estate management or development\ncompanies, expose investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly as well as to the\nrisks from the way that such companies\noperate. Real estate companies and property\nvalues may be adversely affected by\nregulations and other governmental actions,\nincluding tax increases, zoning changes and\nother usage restrictions, environmental\nregulations, regulatory limitations on rent or\neviction, and eminent domain. Certain real\nestate companies, such as REITs, could fail to\nqualify for favorable tax or regulatory\ntreatment. Real estate is highly sensitive to\ngeneral and local economic conditions and can\nbe subject to intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Real estate companies may own a\nlimited number of properties and concentrate\ntheir investments in a particular geographic\nregion, industry or property type. Economic\ndownturns or other adverse events (e.g.,\nnatural disasters) that affect a particular\nregion, industry or property type may lead to\ndecreases in property values, leasing declines\nand defaults by borrowers or tenants. In the\nevent of a default, a real estate company may\nexperience substantial delays and costs in\nenforcing its rights with respect to the\nproperty and protecting its investment. In\naddition, because real estate is relatively\nilliquid, a company may be constrained in its\nability to diversify or liquidate its\ninvestments in response to economic conditions\nor other events. Real estate companies may\ndepend on the management skills of a few key\nindividuals and may have limited financial\nresources. They may be highly leveraged, which\ncan magnify losses, and interest rate\nincreases can make it difficult for them, as\nwell as borrowers and tenants, to obtain debt\nfinancing and meet payment obligations.\nDeclining interest rates could result in\nincreased prepayment on loans and require\nredeployment of capital in less desirable\ninvestments. Certain real estate companies,\nsuch as REITs, could fail to qualify for\nfavorable tax or regulatory treatment, which\ncould produce adverse economic consequences\nfor the company and its investors, including a\nFund. Risk of Investing in the U.S. Investing\nin U.S. issuers involves legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security, and economic\nrisks that are specific to the U.S. A decrease\nin imports or exports, changes in trade\nregulations, inflation, an economic recession,\nfinancial system stress, or political turmoil,\namong other risks, may have an adverse effect\non the U.S. economy and the securities listed\non U.S. exchanges. The U.S. is also subject to\nthe risk of natural disasters, such as\ndroughts, earthquakes, fires and floods. U.S.\nsecurity risks include acts of terrorism,\ninternal unrest and a deterioration in\nrelations between the U.S. and certain\ncountries. Any of these may adversely affect\nthe U.S. economy, financial markets or\nissuers. Governmental agencies project that\nthe U.S. will maintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable future. Although\nelevated debt levels do not necessarily\nindicate or cause economic problems, the costs\nof servicing such debt may constrain future\neconomic growth. 13 Circumstances could arise\nthat could prevent the timely payment of\ninterest or principal on U.S. government debt,\nsuch as reaching the legislative \u201c debt\nceiling. \u201d Such non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences for the U.S.\neconomy and the global financial system.\nSecurities Lending Risk. A Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that a Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. A Fund could also lose money\nin the event of a decline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned securities or a\ndecline in the value of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These events could also\ntrigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nSmall-Capitalization Companies Risk.\nInvestments in small-capitalization companies\nmay be riskier, less liquid, more volatile and\nmore susceptible to economic, market and\nindustry changes than investments in large- or\nmid-capitalization companies. Small-\ncapitalization companies may have more limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources,\npersonnel and management experience. As a\nresult, they generally are more vulnerable\nthan larger companies to adverse business and\neconomic developments. Small-capitalization\ncompanies may have a short business track\nrecord, with relatively less information\navailable to investors. The securities of\nsmaller companies may trade less frequently\nand in lower volumes than the securities of\nlarger companies. Some securities of smaller\nissuers may be illiquid or restricted as to\nresale, and their values may have significant\nvolatility. A Fund may be unable to liquidate\nits positions in such securities at any time,\nor at a favorable price, in order to meet the\nFund\u2019s obligations. Technology Companies Risk.\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources and personnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence as well as\nunexpected risks and costs related to new\nproduct introduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies may\nbe adversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs. Telecommunications\nSector Risk. The telecommunications sector is\nsubject to extensive government regulation.\nThe costs of complying with governmental\nregulations, delays or failure to receive\nrequired regulatory approvals, or the\nenactment of new regulatory requirements may\nnegatively affect the business of\ntelecommunications companies. Government\nactions around the world, specifically in the\narea of pre-marketing clearance of products\nand prices, can be arbitrary and\nunpredictable. The domestic telecommunications\nmarket is characterized by increasing\ncompetition and regulation by various state\nand federal regulatory authorities. Companies\nin the telecommunications sector may encounter\ndistressed cash flows due to the need to\ncommit substantial capital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may make the\nproducts and services of certain\ntelecommunications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers are generally\nrequired to obtain franchises or licenses in\norder to provide services in a given location.\nLicensing and franchise rights in the\ntelecommunications sector are limited, which\nmay provide an advantage to certain\nparticipants. Limited availability of such\nrights, high barriers to market entry and\nregulatory oversight, among other factors,\nhave led to consolidation of companies within\nthe sector, which could lead to further\nregulation or other negative effects in the\nfuture. Threshold/Underinvestment Risk. If\ncertain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership\nthresholds are reached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates or a Fund,\nor as a result of third-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or regulator, the ability\nof BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients\n(including a Fund) to purchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or undertake\nbusiness transactions may be restricted by\nregulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity\nof a Fund to invest in certain securities or\nother assets may be affected by the relevant\nthreshold limits, and such limitations may\nhave adverse effects on the liquidity and\nperformance of the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nTo the extent a Fund tracks an index, such\nlimits may increase the risk of the Fund being\nunderinvested in an asset relative to its\nUnderlying Index and increase the risk of\ntracking error. For example, ownership limits\nmay apply to securities whose issuers operate\nin certain regulated industries or in certain\ninternational markets. Such limits also may\napply where the investing entity (such as a\nFund) is subject to corporate or regulatory\nownership restrictions or invests in certain\nfutures or other derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel amounts invested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including a Fund) may not\nexceed the relevant limits without the grant\nof a license or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent. In other cases, exceeding such\nthresholds may cause BFA and its affiliates, a\nFund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions.\nTracking Error Risk. A Fund may be subject to\n\u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence of\na Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin a Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by a Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; a Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by a Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for a Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index, such\nas during a rebalancing or reconstitution; and\nimpacts to a Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. A Fund that\ntracks an index 14 composed of a large number\nof securities or other assets may experience\ngreater tracking error than a Fund that tracks\na more narrow index. Tracking error risk may\nbe heightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nUtility Companies Risk. Utility infrastructure\noften requires significant capital\nexpenditures, and utility companies may face\nhigh interest costs and difficulty in raising\ncapital. Technological innovations may render\nexisting equipment or products obsolete, and\ncompanies may experience difficulty in\nobtaining regulatory approval of new\ntechnologies. Utility operations may be\ndisrupted by events that target or damage\nutility infrastructure, including natural\ndisasters and cyber or other attacks.\nUtilities companies may be adversely affected\nby volatility in the price of certain energy\nresources. Utility companies face risks from\ngovernment regulation and oversight as well as\nfrom deregulation (if applicable). Regulators\nmay monitor and control companies\u2019 revenues\nand costs. There is no assurance that\nregulators will grant rate increases or that\nrate levels will be adequate to permit the\npayment of stock dividends or bond coupon\npayments. In addition, there may be regulatory\nrestrictions on the ability of utility\ncompanies to enter new lines of business and\ngeographic areas. Utility companies incur\ncosts in complying with environmental and\nother regulations and may face significant\nchallenges in obtaining regulatory approval\nfor certain projects, such as nuclear power\nplants. Utility companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. Energy conservation, climate\nchange and other sustainability policies also\nmay impact utility companies. Deregulation may\nsubject companies to greater competition, may\nadversely affect their profitability and may\nlead them to engage in riskier ventures. Value\nSecurities Risk. Value securities are those\nissued by companies that may be perceived as\nundervalued. Such securities may decline in\nprice or fail to appreciate for long periods\nof time, and they may never realize their full\npotential value because the market fails to\nrecognize the stock\u2019s intrinsic worth. Value\nsecurities may underperform growth securities\nand other types of assets as well as the\noverall stock market. Although value\nsecurities have generally performed better\nthan non-value securities during periods of\neconomic recovery, there is no assurance that\nthey will continue to do so. Value securities\nmay go in and out of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of a Fund with\nsuch holdings. Portfolio Holdings Information\nA description of the policies and procedures\nwith respect to the disclosure of the Funds'\nportfolio securities and other assets (as\napplicable) is available in the applicable\nStatement of Additional Information ( \u201c SAI \u201d\n). Each Fund discloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com. Fact sheets\nproviding information about each Fund\u2019s top\nholdings are posted on www.iShares.com when\navailable and may be requested by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737). Management of\nthe Funds Investment Adviser As investment\nadviser, BFA has overall responsibility for\nthe general management and administration of\nthe Funds. BFA provides an investment program\nfor the Funds and manages the investment of\nthe Funds\u2019 assets. In seeking to achieve the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment objectives, BFA\nuses teams of portfolio managers, investment\nstrategists and other investment specialists\nand may draw upon the trading, research and\nexpertise of its affiliates. This team\napproach brings together many disciplines and\nleverages BFA\u2019s extensive resources. BFA is an\nindirect wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ) and is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. As of\nJune 30, 2024, BFA and its affiliates provided\ninvestment advisory services for assets of\napproximately $10.6 trillion. From time to\ntime, an employee of BlackRock may express\nviews regarding a particular security or other\ninstrument, asset class, company, industry, or\nmarket sector. Such views are the views of\nonly that individual as of the time expressed.\nThey do not necessarily represent the views of\nBlackRock or any other person within the\nBlackRock organization. Such views may change\nat any time based upon market or other\nconditions, and BlackRock has no\nresponsibility to update such views. You\nshould not rely on any such views as\ninvestment advice or as an indication of\ntrading intent on behalf of a Fund. Fees and\nExpenses Pursuant to the Investment Advisory\nAgreement between BFA and the Trust (entered\ninto on behalf of the Funds), BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\neach Fund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses and any\nextraordinary expenses (as determined by a\nmajority of the Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the Trust). Operating\nexpenses paid by BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude acquired fund fees\nand expenses, if any. A discussion regarding\nthe basis for the approval by the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d ) of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with BFA is\navailable in the Funds\u2019 Form N-CSR filed with\nthe SEC for the period ended October 31 and in\nthe applicable financial statements posted at\nwww.iShares.com. For its investment advisory\nservices to each Fund, for the fiscal year\nended April 30, 2024, BFA was paid a\nmanagement fee from each Fund, as a percentage\nof the Fund\u2019s average daily net assets, net of\nany applicable waivers, at the annual rate set\nforth in the table below. If BFA 15\n\nhas contractually agreed to waive a portion of\nits management fees for a Fund, the\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nits expiration date only upon written\nagreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition,\nBFA may from time to time voluntarily waive\nand/or reimburse fees or expenses to reduce a\nFund\u2019s total annual fund operating expenses\n(excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if\nany). Any such voluntary waiver or\nreimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime.\n                                              \n  Fund                        Management Fee  \n  iShares Core Dividend ETF   0.05%           \n  iShares Core Dividend       0.08%           \n  Growth ETF                                  \n  iShares Dow Jones U.S. ETF  0.20%           \n  iShares Morningstar Growth  0.04%           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Morningstar         0.04%           \n  Mid-Cap ETF                                 \n  iShares Morningstar         0.06%           \n  Mid-Cap Growth ETF                          \n  iShares Morningstar         0.06%           \n  Mid-Cap Value ETF                           \n  iShares Morningstar         0.04%           \n  Small-Cap ETF                               \n  iShares Morningstar         0.06%           \n  Small-Cap Growth ETF                        \n  iShares Morningstar         0.06%           \n  Small-Cap Value ETF                         \n  iShares Morningstar U.S.    0.03%           \n  Equity ETF                                  \n  iShares Morningstar Value   0.04%           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI KLD 400        0.25%           \n  Social ETF                                  \n  iShares MSCI USA ESG        0.25%           \n  Select ETF                                  \n                                              \nPortfolio Managers The Portfolio Managers for\neach Fund are responsible for various\nfunctions related to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to, investing cash\ninflows, coordinating with members of their\nrespective portfolio management teams to focus\non certain asset classes, implementing\ninvestment strategy, researching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and overseeing members of\ntheir respective teams who have more limited\nresponsibilities.

BFA and its Affiliates are\ninvolved worldwide with a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset management\nactivities and in the ordinary course of\nbusiness may engage in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests of other\nclients may conflict with those of a Fund. BFA\nand its Affiliates act, or may act, as an\ninvestor, research provider, investment\nmanager, commodity pool operator, commodity\ntrading advisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent\nand/or principal. BFA and its Affiliates may\nhave other direct and indirect interests in\nsecurities, currencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other assets in which a Fund\nmay directly or indirectly invest. BFA and its\nAffiliates may engage in proprietary trading\nand advise accounts and other funds that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in and compete for\ntransactions in the same or similar types of\nsecurities, currencies and other assets as are\nheld by a Fund. This may include transactions\nin securities issued by other open-end and\nclosed-end investment companies, including\ninvestment companies that are affiliated with\nthe Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). The trading\nactivities of BFA and its Affiliates are\ncarried out without reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by a Fund. These\nactivities may result in BFA or an Affiliate\nhaving positions in assets that are senior or\njunior to, or that have interests different\nfrom or adverse to, the assets held by a Fund.\nA Fund may invest in securities issued by, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nwith which an Affiliate has significant debt\nor equity investments or other interests. A\nFund may also invest in issuances (such as\ndebt offerings or structured notes) for which\nan Affiliate is compensated for providing\nadvisory, cash management or other services. A\nFund also may invest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nfor which an Affiliate provides or may provide\nresearch coverage or other analysis. An\nAffiliate may have business relationships\nwith, and receive compensation from,\ndistributors, consultants or others who\nrecommend a Fund or who engage in transactions\nwith or for a Fund. Neither BlackRock nor any\nAffiliate is under any obligation to share any\ninvestment opportunity, idea or strategy with\na Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete\nwith a Fund for appropriate investment\nopportunities. The results of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of other\naccounts managed by an Affiliate. It is\npossible that a Fund could sustain losses\nduring periods in which one or more Affiliates\nand other accounts achieve profits on their\ntrading for proprietary or other accounts. The\nopposite result is also possible. In addition,\na Fund may enter into transactions in which\nBFA or an Affiliate or their directors,\nofficers, employees or clients have an adverse\ninterest. A Fund may be adversely impacted by\nthe effects of transactions undertaken by BFA\nor an Affiliate or their directors, officers,\nemployees or clients. From time to time,\nBlackRock or its advisory clients (including\nother funds and accounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, purchase and\nhold shares of a Fund. The price,\navailability, liquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by BlackRock\nor its advisory clients. A Fund\u2019s activities\nmay be limited because of regulatory\nrestrictions applicable to BFA or an Affiliate\nor their policies designed to comply with such\nrestrictions. Under a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board, the Funds have\nretained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as\ntheir securities lending agent to the extent\nthat they participate in the securities\nlending program. For these services, the\nsecurities lending agent will receive a fee\nfrom the participating Fund based on the\nreturns earned on the Fund\u2019s lending\nactivities, including investment of the cash\nreceived as collateral for the loaned\nsecurities. In addition, one or more\nAffiliates may be among the entities to which\na Fund may lend its portfolio securities under\nthe securities lending program. Under an ETF\nServices Agreement, certain iShares ETFs have\nretained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an Affiliate of\nBFA, to perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock\n\n17\n\ncollaborated with, and received payment from,\nCitibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d ) on the design\nand development of the ETF Services platform.\nCitibank may have, or from time to time may\ndevelop, additional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its\nAffiliates. BlackRock and its Affiliates may\nbenefit from a Fund using a BlackRock index by\ncreating increasing acceptance in the\nmarketplace for such indexes. BlackRock and\nits Affiliates are not obligated to license an\nindex to a Fund, and no Fund is under an\nobligation to use a BlackRock index. The terms\nof a Fund\u2019s index licensing agreement with\nBlackRock or its Affiliates may not be as\nfavorable as the terms offered to other\nlicensees. The activities of BFA and its\nAffiliates and their respective directors,\nofficers or employees may give rise to other\nconflicts of interest that could disadvantage\na Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted\npolicies and procedures designed to address\nthese potential conflicts of interest. Please\nsee the SAI for further information.\nShareholder Information Additional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy and sell\nshares of the Funds, is available free of\ncharge by calling toll-free 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting www.iShares.com.\nBuying and Selling Shares Transactions in\nshares of the Funds occur in the primary\nmarket and the secondary market. Primary\nmarket transactions, known as \u201c creations \u201d\nand \u201c redemptions, \u201d occur only between the\nFunds and Authorized Participants ( i.e .,\nfinancial institutions that are authorized to\nparticipate in such transactions), as\ndescribed in the Creations and Redemptions\nsection below. Fund shares are listed on U.S.\nnational securities exchanges, where they can\nbe bought and sold throughout the trading day\nat market prices, like shares of other\npublicly traded companies. A Fund\u2019s shares may\nalso be available in other secondary markets,\nsuch as on non-U.S. exchanges and through\nfunds or structured investment vehicles\nsimilar to depositary receipts. The Funds do\nnot impose any minimum investment for Fund\nshares purchased on an exchange or otherwise\nin the secondary market. Buying or selling\nFund shares on an exchange or other secondary\nmarket generally involves two types of costs\nthat are common in securities transactions.\nFirst, when buying or selling Fund shares\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. The commission\nis frequently a fixed amount; it may be a\nsignificant proportional cost if you are\nseeking to buy or sell small amounts of\nshares. Second, you may incur the cost of the\n\u201c spread, \u201d which is any difference between\nthe bid price and the ask price for the\nshares. The spread varies over time based on a\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market liquidity.\nGenerally, the spread is smaller if a Fund has\nhigh trading volume and market liquidity, and\nlarger if a Fund has lower trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. The latter is often the case\nfor newly launched or smaller funds. A Fund\u2019s\nspread may also be impacted by the liquidity\n(or lack thereof) of the underlying securities\nor other assets held by the Fund, particularly\nfor newly launched or smaller funds, or by\ninstances of significant volatility of the\nunderlying assets. The U.S. national\nsecurities exchanges that list Fund shares are\nopen for trading Monday through Friday and are\nclosed on weekends and the following holidays\n(or the days on which they are observed): New\nYear\u2019s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents\u2019 Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,\nJuneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.\nInvestments in Investment Companies Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts\ninvestments by investment companies, including\nforeign and unregistered investment companies,\nin the securities of other investment\ncompanies. For example, a registered\ninvestment company (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Funds, may not knowingly sell or\notherwise dispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any investment company\n(the \u201c Acquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company or\ncompanies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if,\nimmediately after such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or\n(ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and other investment\ncompanies and companies controlled by them.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, registered\ninvestment companies are permitted to invest\nin a Fund beyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions set forth in Rule 12d1-4 under the\n1940 Act. To make such an investment in an\nAcquired Fund, a registered investment company\nmust, among other things, enter into an\nagreement with the Trust. If an Acquired Fund\ninvests significantly in other registered\ninvestment companies in reliance on Rule\n12d1-4, an Acquiring Fund will not be\npermitted to rely on Rule 12d1-4 and invest in\nthe Fund beyond the Section 12(d)(1) limits.\nAny investment company interested in\npurchasing shares of a Fund beyond the limits\nset forth in Section 12(d)(1) should contact\nBFA. Foreign investment companies are\npermitted to invest in a Fund only up to the\nlimits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject\nto any applicable SEC no-action relief. Book\nEntry Shares of the Funds are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The Depository Trust\nCompany ( \u201c DTC \u201d ), which serves as the\nsecurities depository for shares of the Funds,\nor its nominee is the record owner of, and\nholds legal title to, all outstanding shares\nof the Funds. 18 Investors owning Fund shares\nare beneficial owners as shown on the records\nof DTC or its participants. DTC participants\ninclude securities brokers and dealers, banks,\ntrust companies, clearing corporations and\nother institutions that directly or indirectly\nmaintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As\na beneficial owner of Fund shares, you are not\nentitled to receive physical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares registered in\nyour name, and you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares. Therefore, to\nexercise any right as an owner of Fund shares,\nyou must rely upon the procedures of DTC and\nits participants. These procedures are the\nsame as those that apply to any other\nsecurities held in book-entry or \u201c street name\n\u201d form. Share Prices The trading prices of a\nFund\u2019s shares in the secondary market\ngenerally differ from the Fund\u2019s daily NAV and\nare affected by various factors, such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF shares and the\nsecurities or other assets held by a Fund as\nwell as other market and economic conditions.\nDetermination of Net Asset Value The NAV of a\nFund normally is determined once daily Monday\nthrough Friday, on each day that the New York\nStock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) is open for\ntrading. The NAV generally is determined as of\nthe close of the NYSE\u2019s regular trading hours,\nnormally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, based on\nprices at the time of closing. Any Fund assets\nor liabilities that are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing\nmarket rates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data service providers.\nThe NAV of a Fund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s net assets ( i.e .,\nthe value of its total assets, including the\nvalue of any underlying fund shares in which\nthe Fund invests, less total liabilities) by\nthe total number of outstanding shares of the\nFund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.\nThe value of a Fund\u2019s assets and liabilities\nis determined pursuant to BFA\u2019s valuation\npolicies and procedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the valuation\ndesignee for each Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5\nunder the Investment Company Act. Equity\nsecurities and other equity instruments for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at market value, which is generally\ndetermined using the last reported official\nclosing price or, if a reported closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on the\nexchange or market on which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at the time of\nvaluation. Shares of underlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds) that are not\ntraded on an exchange are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying ETFs and closed-\nend funds that trade on exchanges are valued\nat their most recent market closing price.\nFixed-income securities are valued using last\navailable bid prices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or prices\n(including evaluated prices) supplied by the\nFunds\u2019 approved independent third-party\npricing services, each in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s valuation policies and procedures.\nPricing services may use matrix pricing or\nvaluation models that utilize certain inputs\nand assumptions to derive values. Pricing\nservices generally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly transactions of an\ninstitutional round lot size, but a Fund may\nhold or transact in such securities in smaller\nodd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower\nprices than institutional round lots. An\namortized cost method of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations with 60 days\nor less remaining to maturity unless BFA\ndetermines in good faith that such method does\nnot represent fair value. Generally, trading\nin certain instruments ( e.g ., non-U.S.\nsecurities, money market instruments, etc.) is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of the NYSE\u2019s regular\ntrading hours. The values of such instruments\nused in computing a Fund\u2019s NAV are determined\nas of such times. For certain foreign assets,\na third-party vendor supplies evaluated,\nsystematic fair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-factor model\nafter the relevant foreign markets have\nclosed. This systematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to correlate the\nprices of foreign assets in one or more\nnon-U.S. markets following the close of the\nlocal markets to the prices that might have\nprevailed as of a Fund\u2019s pricing time.\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options may\nbe valued using a mathematical model that may\nincorporate a number of market data factors.\nWhen market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in accordance with its policies\nand procedures. Fair value represents a good\nfaith approximation of the value of an asset\nor liability. It is the amount that the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive from the\ncurrent sale of an asset or the cost to\nextinguish a liability in an arm\u2019s-length\ntransaction. BFA may conclude that a market\nquotation is not readily available or is\nunreliable if: \u25a0 An asset or liability does\nnot have a price source due to its lack of\ntrading or other reasons; \u25a0 A market quotation\ndiffers significantly from recent price\nquotations or otherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value; \u25a0 The asset or liability\nis thinly traded; \u25a0 There is a significant\nevent subsequent to the most recent market\nquotation; or \u25a0 The trading market on which an\ninstrument is listed is suspended or closed\nand no appropriate alternative trading market\nis available. 19 A \u201c significant event \u201d is\ndeemed to occur if BFA determines, in its\nreasonable business judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u2019s assets or\nliabilities, that the event is likely to cause\na material change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nof the Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities. Valuing a\nFund\u2019s investments using fair value pricing\nmay result in prices that differ from current\nmarket valuations and that may not be the\nprices at which those investments could have\nbeen sold during the period for which the\nparticular fair values were used. For an index\nFund, the use of both fair value prices and\ncurrent market valuations in a particular NAV\ncalculation could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying index. This could, in turn, result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of its underlying index.\nDividends and Distributions General Policies.\nA Fund generally declares and pays dividends\nfrom net investment income, if any, at least\nonce a year. Distributions of net realized\nsecurities gains, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid once a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more frequent\nbasis for a Fund. The Trust reserves the right\nto declare special distributions if, in its\nreasonable discretion, such action is\nnecessary or advisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d )\nor to avoid the imposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or realized\ngains. Dividends and other distributions on\nFund shares are distributed on a pro rata\nbasis to beneficial owners of the shares.\nDividend payments and other distributions are\nmade through DTC participants and indirect\nparticipants to beneficial owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from the Funds.\nDividend Reinvestment Service. No dividend\nreinvestment service is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make the DTC book-entry\nDividend Reinvestment Program available to\nbeneficial owners of Fund shares for the\nreinvestment of distributions. Beneficial\nowners should contact their broker to\ndetermine the availability and costs of the\nservice and the details of participation.\nBrokers may require beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and timetables.\nIf the program is used, dividend distributions\nof both income and realized gains will be\nautomatically reinvested in additional whole\nFund shares purchased in the secondary market.\nNote on Tax Information. The following\nsections summarize some of the consequences\nunder current U.S. federal tax law of an\ninvestment in a Fund. This information is not\na substitute for personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and local taxation on\nFund distributions and sales of Fund shares.\nDistributions that are attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal government\nobligations may be exempt from certain state\nand local tax. Consult your personal tax\nadvisor about the potential tax consequences\nof an investment in Fund shares under all\napplicable tax laws. Taxes As with any\ninvestment, you should consider how your\ninvestment in shares of a Fund will be taxed,\nincluding possible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or when you sell Fund\nshares. The tax information in this Prospectus\nis provided as general information, based on\ncurrent law. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund. There is no\nguarantee that shares of a Fund will receive\ncertain regulatory or accounting treatment.\nTaxes on Fund Distributions Shareholders in a\nFund will receive information after the end of\neach calendar year setting forth the amount of\ndividends and long-term capital gains\ndistributed to them by the Fund during the\nprior year, if any. Likewise, the amount of\ntax-exempt income, if any, that a Fund\ndistributes will be reported. Such income must\nbe reported on the shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax return. In general, distributions\nare subject to U.S. federal income tax for the\nyear when they are paid. Certain distributions\npaid in January, however, may be treated as\npaid on December 31 of the prior year. Capital\nGains. Distributions from a Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than qualified\ndividend income or from net tax-exempt income,\nif any), including distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and distributions out\nof a Fund\u2019s net short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as ordinary income.\nDistributions by a Fund of net long-term\ncapital gains, if any, in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses (capital gain dividends)\nare taxable to you as long-term capital gains,\nregardless of how long you have held the\nFund\u2019s shares. Long-term capital gains and\nqualified dividend income are generally\neligible for taxation at preferential rates\nfor non-corporate shareholders. However,\ndifferent preferential rates may apply\ndepending on the type of capital gains, such\nas Fund distributions of certain amounts\nreceived from REITs, if any. Return of\nCapital. If a Fund\u2019s distributions exceed\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits,\nall or a portion of the distributions made in\nthe taxable year may be recharacterized as a\nreturn of capital to shareholders. A return of\ncapital distribution generally will not be\ntaxable but will reduce the shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis and result in a higher capital gain or\nlower capital loss when those shares on which\nthe distribution was received are sold. Once a\nshareholder\u2019s cost basis is reduced to zero,\nfurther distributions will be treated as\ncapital gains, if the shareholder holds shares\nof the Fund as capital assets. Distributions\nin excess of a Fund\u2019s minimum distribution\nrequirements, but not in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be taxable to\nshareholders and will not constitute\nnontaxable returns of capital. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by a Fund that\nqualify as qualified dividend income, if any,\nare taxable to you at long-term capital gain\nrates. Dividends will be qualified dividend\nincome to you if they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income received by a Fund.\n20 Generally, qualified dividend income\nincludes dividend income from stock issued by\ntaxable U.S. corporations and qualified\nnon-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund\nsatisfies certain holding period requirements\nand has not hedged its position in the stock\nin certain ways. For this purpose, a qualified\nnon-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S.\ncorporation that is eligible for benefits\nunder a comprehensive income tax treaty with\nthe U.S., which includes an exchange of\ninformation program, or if the stock with\nrespect to which the dividend was paid is\nreadily tradable on an established U.S.\nsecurities market. The term excludes a\ncorporation that is a passive foreign\ninvestment company. Dividends received by a\nFund from a RIC, if any, generally are\nqualified dividend income only to the extent\nthat such dividend distributions are made out\nof qualified dividend income received by such\nRIC. Additionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from a REIT, if\nany, and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a Fund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified business income\n\u201d deduction for non-corporate U.S.\nshareholders to the extent that the Fund\u2019s\nincome is derived from ordinary REIT\ndividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.\nFor a dividend to be treated as qualified\ndividend income, the dividend must be received\nwith respect to a share of stock held without\nbeing hedged by the relevant Fund, and with\nrespect to a share of the Fund held without\nbeing hedged by you, for 61 days during the\n121-day period beginning at the date that is\n60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such date. Fund\ndistributions, to the extent attributable to\ndividends from U.S. corporations, will be\neligible for the dividends received deduction\nfor Fund shareholders that are corporations,\nsubject to certain hedging and holding\nrequirements. Substitute dividends received by\na Fund with respect to dividends paid on\nsecurities lent out, if any, will not be\nqualified dividend income. Medicare Tax. A\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is\nimposed on \u201c net investment income, \u201d\nincluding, but not limited to, interest,\ndividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if\nmarried and filing jointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Alternative Minimum Tax. The AMT is a\nseparate U.S. federal tax system that operates\nin parallel to the regular federal income tax\nsystem but eliminates many deductions and\nexclusions. The AMT has different tax rates\nand treats as taxable certain types of income\nthat are nontaxable for regular income tax\npurposes, such as the interest on certain \u201c\nprivate activity \u201d municipal bonds. If a\ntaxpayer\u2019s overall AMT liability is higher\nthan regular income tax liability, then the\ntaxpayer owes the regular income tax liability\nplus the difference between the AMT liability\nand the regular income tax liability. Market\nDiscount Bonds Any market discount recognized\non a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or adjusted issue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount. To the extent that a\nFund does not include the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gains on the Fund\u2019s\ndisposition of such an obligation will be\ntreated as ordinary income rather than capital\ngains to the extent of the accrued market\ndiscount. Derivatives and Other Complex\nInstruments A Fund may invest in derivatives\nand other complex instruments, and such\ninvestments may be subject to special and\ncomplicated rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund\nare treated as ordinary income or capital\ngains, accelerate the recognition of income to\na Fund or defer a Fund\u2019s ability to recognize\nlosses. In addition, these rules may affect\nthe amount, timing or character of income\ndistributed to you by a Fund. You should\nconsult your personal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules. Non-U.S.\nIncome Taxes Dividends, interest and capital\ngains (if any) earned by a Fund with respect\nto securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may\ngive rise to withholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If,\nat the close of a year, more than 50% of a\nFund\u2019s total assets consist of non-U.S. stocks\nor securities (generally, for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ), generally the Fund may \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to you certain non-U.S. income\ntaxes, including withholding taxes, paid by\nthe Fund. This means that you would be\nconsidered to have received as an additional\ndividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes,\nbut you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your U.S.\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not pass through\nnon-U.S. taxes, the Fund will be entitled to\nclaim a deduction for certain foreign taxes\nthat it incurs. Under certain circumstances,\nif a Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes\npaid with respect to a prior year, the value\nof Fund shares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions passed\nthrough to shareholders with respect to the\nFund\u2019s foreign taxes for the current year\ncould be reduced. If, at the close of the\nyear, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets\nconsist of stocks or securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers, including depositary\nreceipts (no matter where traded) of non-U.S.\ncompanies, or, at the close of each quarter,\nmore than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets 21\nconsist of shares of an Underlying Fund, the\nFund may \u201c pass-through \u201d to you certain\nnon-U.S. income taxes (including withholding\ntaxes) paid by the Fund or, if its assets meet\nthese requirements, the Underlying Fund. For\npurposes of foreign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of a Fund, foreign capital gains\ntaxes may not produce associated foreign\nsource income, limiting the availability of\nsuch credits for U.S. persons. Non-U.S.\nShareholders If you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S.\nentity (other than a pass-through entity to\nthe extent owned by U.S. persons), a Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term capital\ngains), if any, generally will be subject to a\n30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a\nlower treaty rate applies. However,\nwithholding tax generally will not apply to\nany gain or income realized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder with respect to any distribution\nof long-term capital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of Fund shares. Separately,\na 30% withholding tax may be imposed on Fund\ndistributions (if any) paid to certain foreign\nentities, unless such entities comply, or are\ndeemed compliant, with extensive reporting and\nwithholding requirements designed to inform\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury of\nU.S.-owned foreign investment accounts. Backup\nWithholding If you are a resident or a citizen\nof the U.S. and you have not provided a\ntaxpayer identification number or social\nsecurity number and made other required\ncertifications, by law, backup withholding at\na 24% rate will apply to Fund distributions\nand proceeds (if any). Securities Lending If\nyour shares of a Fund are loaned out pursuant\nto a securities lending arrangement, you may\nlose the ability to treat Fund dividends that\nare paid while the shares are held by the\nborrower as qualified dividend income, and you\nmay lose the ability to use non-U.S. tax\ncredits passed through by the Fund. Fund of\nFunds If a Fund invests in an Underlying Fund,\nshort-term capital gains earned by the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will be ordinary\nincome when distributed to the Fund and will\nnot be offset by the Fund\u2019s capital losses. To\nthe extent such Fund is expected to invest in\nan Underlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s realized losses\non sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may\nbe indefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c\nwash sales. \u201d Capital loss carryforwards of\nthe Underlying Fund, if any, will not offset\nnet capital gains of the Fund. Taxes on the\nSale of Exchange-Listed Fund Shares Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund shares is generally treated as a long-\nterm capital gain or loss if the shares have\nbeen held for more than one year. Any capital\ngain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund\nshares that have been held for one year or\nless is generally treated as a short-term\ncapital gain or loss. However, any capital\nloss on a sale of Fund shares held for six\nmonths or less is treated as a long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to such\nshares. Any such capital gains, including from\nsales of Fund shares or from capital gain\ndividends, are included in \u201c net investment\nincome \u201d for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal\nMedicare contribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions Prior to being\ntraded in the secondary market, Fund shares\nare \u201c created \u201d at NAV by Authorized\nParticipants ( i.e. , market makers, large\ninvestors and other financial institutions) in\nblock-size Creation Units or multiples\nthereof. Fund shares are created or redeemed\nonly in Creation Units, and only Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem Creation\nUnits with the Funds. Each Authorized\nParticipant is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC and\nhas entered into a written agreement with the\nFunds\u2019 Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. The\nagreement allows the Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. Authorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units for their own\naccounts or for customers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of the Funds. Creation\ntransactions are subject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the relevant Fund. Generally,\nthere are three transaction methods for\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares: in-kind\nsecurities ( \u201c in-kind \u201d ), partial cash and\nall cash. In-Kind . In a creation transaction,\nan Authorized Participant deposits into a Fund\na \u201c creation basket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets designated by the\nFund, as well as a cash amount. The Authorized\nParticipant receives a specified number of\nCreation Units in return. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits Creation Units with a Fund and\nreceives from the Fund a \u201c redemption basket,\n\u201d which is a portfolio of securities or other\nassets designated by the Fund, as well as a\ncash amount. Partial Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund a creation basket and a\ncash amount, including cash that replaces a\nsecurity or other asset in the creation\nbasket, in exchange for Creation Units. In a\nredemption transaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation Units with a\nFund and receives from the Fund a redemption\nbasket and a cash amount, including cash that\nreplaces a security or other asset in the\nredemption basket. 22\n\nAll Cash . In a creation transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits into a Fund an\namount of cash specified by the Fund in\nexchange for Creation Units. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits Creation Units with a Fund and\nreceives from the Fund a specified amount of\ncash. The creation and redemption baskets for\na Fund may differ in composition, and certain\niShares ETFs accept \u201c custom baskets. \u201d More\ninformation about custom baskets is provided\nin the Funds\u2019 SAI. Each Fund generally engages\nin creation and redemption transactions\naccording to the method indicated in the table\nbelow. In certain circumstances, however, a\nFund may use another transaction method ( e.g.\n, an in-kind Fund may transact partially or\nfully in cash).\n                                              \n  Fund        In-Kind  Partial      All Cash  \n                       Cash                   \n  iShares                                     \n  Core        \u2713                               \n  Dividend                                    \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Core        \u2713                               \n  Dividend                                    \n  Growth ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Dow Jones   \u2713                               \n  U.S. ETF                                    \n  iShares                                     \n  Morningst\u2026  \u2713                               \n  Growth ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Morningst\u2026  \u2713                               \n  Mid-Cap                                     \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Morningst\u2026  \u2713                               \n  Mid-Cap                                     \n  Growth ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Morningst\u2026  \u2713                               \n  Mid-Cap                                     \n  Value ETF                                   \n  iShares                                     \n  Morningst\u2026  \u2713                               \n  Small-Cap                                   \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Morningst\u2026  \u2713                               \n  Small-Cap                                   \n  Growth ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Morningst\u2026  \u2713                               \n  Small-Cap                                   \n  Value ETF                                   \n  iShares                                     \n  Morningst\u2026  \u2713                               \n  U.S.                                        \n  Equity ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Morningst\u2026  \u2713                               \n  Value ETF                                   \n  iShares                                     \n  MSCI KLD    \u2713                               \n  400 Social                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  MSCI USA    \u2713                               \n  ESG Select                                  \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nThe prices at which creations and redemptions\noccur are based on the next calculation of a\nFund\u2019s NAV after a creation or redemption\norder is tendered in an acceptable form under\nthe Authorized Participant agreement. In the\nevent of a system failure or other\ninterruption, including disruptions at market\nmakers or Authorized Participants, creation\nand redemption orders may not be executed\naccording to a Fund\u2019s instructions or may not\nbe executed at all. Additional information\nabout the creation and redemption of Creation\nUnits (including the cut-off times for the\nreceipt of creation and redemption orders) is\nincluded in the Funds\u2019 SAI. The Funds do not\nimpose restrictions on the frequency of\npurchases and redemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with a Fund. The Board determined not\nto adopt policies and procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares because each Fund\ngenerally sells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions that are in-kind\nand/or for cash, with a deadline for placing\ncash-related transactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities. However, the Funds have\ntaken certain measures ( e.g. , imposing\ntransaction fees on purchases and redemptions\nof Creation Units and reserving the right to\nreject purchases of Creation Units under\ncertain circumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of frequent cash\npurchases and redemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased tracking\nerror, disruption of portfolio management,\ndilution to the Funds, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the vast majority\nof trading in Fund shares occurs on the\nsecondary market, which does not involve the\nFunds directly, and such trading is unlikely\nto cause many of the harmful effects of\nfrequent cash purchases or redemptions of Fund\nshares. To the extent a Fund engages in in-\nkind transactions, the Fund intends to comply\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws in\naccepting securities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with redemption\nsecurities by, among other means, assuring\nthat any securities accepted for deposit and\nany securities used to satisfy redemption\nrequests will be sold in transactions that\nwould be exempt from registration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201c 1933\nAct \u201d ). Further, an Authorized Participant\nthat is not a \u201c qualified institutional buyer,\n\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 144A under\nthe 1933 Act, will not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. Because Fund shares may be\ncreated and issued on an ongoing basis, at any\npoint during the life of a Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is used in the\n1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nthat could render them statutory underwriters\nsubject to the prospectus delivery and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nmust take into account all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each particular case.\nBroker-dealers should also note that dealers\nwho are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution (as contrasted\nto ordinary secondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part of an \u201c\nunsold allotment \u201d within the meaning of\nSection 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be\nunable to take advantage of the prospectus\ndelivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3)\nof the 1933 Act. For delivery\n\n23\n\nof prospectuses to exchange members, the\nprospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153\nunder the 1933 Act is available only with\nrespect to transactions on a national\nsecurities exchange. Householding Householding\nis an option available to certain Fund\ninvestors. Householding is a method of\ndelivery, based on the preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a single copy of\ncertain shareholder documents can be delivered\nto investors who share the same address, even\nif their accounts are registered under\ndifferent names. Please contact your broker-\ndealer if you are interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a single copy of\nprospectuses and other shareholder documents,\nor if you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change your\nhouseholding status. Distribution The\nDistributor or its agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the iShares ETFs on an agency basis.\nThe Distributor does not maintain a secondary\nmarket in shares of the Funds. The Distributor\nhas no role in determining the policies of the\nFunds or the securities or other assets (as\napplicable) that are purchased or sold by the\nFunds. The Distributor\u2019s principal address is\n50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. BFA or\nits affiliates make payments to broker-\ndealers, registered investment advisers, banks\nor other intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, data provision services, or\ntheir making shares of iShares ETFs available\nto their customers generally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such payments, which may\nbe significant to the intermediary, are not\nmade by the Funds. Rather, such payments are\nmade by BFA or its affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or indirectly\nin part from fees paid by the iShares ETFs.\nPayments of this type are sometimes referred\nto as revenue-sharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions about which\ninvestment options it recommends or makes\navailable, or the level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the payments or\nother financial incentives the intermediary is\neligible to receive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives that are offered\nor made to an intermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary and its\ncustomers and may cause the intermediary to\nrecommend iShares ETFs over another\ninvestment. More information regarding these\npayments is contained in the applicable SAI.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments that their firm\nmay receive from BFA or its affiliates.\nFinancial Highlights The financial highlights\ntable for each Fund is intended to help you\nunderstand the Fund\u2019s financial performance\nfor the past five fiscal years or, if shorter,\nthe period since the Fund\u2019s inception.

Fees and\nExpenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $34        $106     $185      $418  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 16% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Cohen & Steers Realty Majors Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which consists of up to\n30 relatively large and liquid REITs that may\nbenefit from future consolidation and\nsecuritization of the U.S. real estate\nindustry, as determined by Cohen & Steers\nCapital Management, Inc. (the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d or \u201c Cohen & Steers \u201d ). REITs are selected\nfor inclusion in the Underlying Index based on\na review of several factors, including\nmanagement, portfolio quality, capital\nstructure, and property sector and geographic\ndiversification. Constituents also must meet\nminimum market capitalization and trading\nvolume requirements. The Underlying Index is\nweighted according to the total free float\nadjusted market value of each constituent\u2019s\noutstanding shares and is adjusted quarterly\nso that no constituent represents more than 8%\nof the Underlying Index. Additionally, at the\nquarterly rebalance, the Underlying Index uses\na capping methodology to cap at 45% the\naggregate weight of all constituents that\nindividually exceed 4.5% of the index weight.\nBetween rebalances, constituent weights may\nexceed these constraints due to fluctuations\nin market value, corporate actions, or other\nevents that change the index composition. As\nof April 30, 2024, a significant portion of\nthe Underlying Index is represented by REITs.\nThe components of the Underlying Index are\nlikely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. S-1\n\nIndexing seeks to achieve lower costs and\nbetter after-tax performance by aiming to keep\nportfolio turnover low in comparison to\nactively managed investment companies. BFA\nuses a representative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c Representative\nsampling \u201d is an indexing strategy that\ninvolves investing in a representative sample\nof securities that collectively has an\ninvestment profile similar to that of an\napplicable underlying index. The securities\nselected are expected to have, in the\naggregate, investment characteristics (based\non factors such as market capitalization and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return variability\nand yield) and liquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying index. The\nFund may or may not hold all of the securities\nin the Underlying Index. The Fund generally\nwill invest at least 80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of its Underlying Index\nand may invest up to 20% of its assets in\ncertain futures, options and swap contracts,\ncash and cash equivalents, including shares of\nmoney market funds advised by BFA or its\naffiliates, as well as in securities not\nincluded in the Underlying Index, but which\nBFA believes will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part of that\nposition for the purposes of calculating the\npercentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc.\n(the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c Cohen & Steers \u201d\n), which is independent of the Fund and BFA.\nThe Index Provider determines the composition\nand relative weightings of the securities in\nthe Underlying Index and publishes information\nregarding the market value of the Underlying\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Real\nEstate Companies Risk. Real estate companies,\nwhich include real estate investment trusts\n(\"REITs\"), real estate holding and operating\ncompanies, and real estate management or\ndevelopment companies, expose investors to the\nrisks of owning real estate directly as well\nas to the risks from the way that such\ncompanies operate. Real estate is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and can be subject to intense\ncompetition and periodic overbuilding. Other\nreal estate risks include decreases in\nproperty values, tax increases, zoning\nchanges, casualty or condemnation losses,\nenvironmental liabilities, regulatory\nlimitations on rent or eviction, and defaults\nby borrowers or tenants. Real estate companies\nmay be heavily invested in one geographic\nregion, industry or property type. They also\nmay be highly leveraged, which can magnify\nlosses, and interest rate increases can make\nit difficult to obtain financing and service\ndebt. Risk of Investing in the U.S . Investing\nin U.S. issuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Equity Securities Risk\n. Equity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue, and their values may be more volatile\nthan those of other asset classes. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of\nreasons that may directly relate to the issuer\nas well as due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider S-2 to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk. The securities\nand other assets in the Underlying Index or in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Dividend-Paying\nStock Risk . Investing in dividend-paying\nstocks involves the risk that such stocks may\nfall out of favor with investors and\nunderperform other types of stocks or the\nbroader market. Companies that issue dividend-\npaying stocks are not required to pay or\ncontinue paying dividends on such stocks. It\nis possible that issuers of the stocks held by\nthe Fund will not declare dividends in the\nfuture or will reduce or eliminate the payment\nof dividends (including reducing or\neliminating anticipated accelerations or\nincreases in the payment of dividends), which\nmay adversely affect the Fund. Issuer Risk .\nThe performance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Non-Diversification Risk . The Fund is\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means\nthat, compared with funds that are classified\nas \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a\ngreater percentage of its assets in securities\nor other instruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties and thus\nmay be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand S-3 other expenses incurred by the Fund\nthat the Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-4\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-5\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-6\n\niSHARES \u00ae CORE U.S. REIT ETF Ticker: USRT\nStock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective\nThe iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d )\nseeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of U.S. real estate equities.\nFees and Expenses The following table\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you will\nincur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund. The investment advisory agreement\nbetween iShares Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and\nBlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) provides\nthat BFA will pay all operating expenses of\nthe Fund, except: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv)\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.08%     None       0.00%       0.08%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $8          $26      $45      $103  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 5% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe FTSE Nareit Equity REITs Index (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which measures the\nperformance of U.S.-listed equity real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ), excluding\ninfrastructure REITs, mortgage REITs, and\ntimber REITs. As of April 30, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index is represented by the\nsecurities of 130 REITs, which invest in U.S.\nreal estate markets and may invest in non-U.S.\nreal estate markets. The components of the\nUnderlying Index may change over time. BFA\nuses an indexing approach to try to achieve\nthe Fund\u2019s investment objective. Unlike many\ninvestment companies, the Fund does not try to\n\u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to S-7\n\n20% of its assets in certain futures, options\nand swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby FTSE International Limited (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c FTSE \u201d ), which is independent\nof the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition and relative\nweightings of the securities in the Underlying\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Real Estate Companies\nRisk. Real estate companies, which include\nreal estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"), real\nestate holding and operating companies, and\nreal estate management or development\ncompanies, expose investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly as well as to the\nrisks from the way that such companies\noperate. Real estate is highly sensitive to\ngeneral and local economic conditions and can\nbe subject to intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Other real estate risks include\ndecreases in property values, tax increases,\nzoning changes, casualty or condemnation\nlosses, environmental liabilities, regulatory\nlimitations on rent or eviction, and defaults\nby borrowers or tenants. Real estate companies\nmay be heavily invested in one geographic\nregion, industry or property type. They also\nmay be highly leveraged, which can magnify\nlosses, and interest rate increases can make\nit difficult to obtain financing and service\ndebt. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the S-8 business or do not\nplace creation or redemption orders for the\nFund and no other Authorized Participant\nplaces orders, Fund shares are more likely to\ntrade at a premium or discount to NAV and\npossibly face trading halts or delisting.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Dividend-Paying\nStock Risk . Investing in dividend-paying\nstocks involves the risk that such stocks may\nfall out of favor with investors and\nunderperform other types of stocks or the\nbroader market. Companies that issue dividend-\npaying stocks are not required to pay or\ncontinue paying dividends on such stocks. It\nis possible that issuers of the stocks held by\nthe Fund will not declare dividends in the\nfuture or will reduce or eliminate the payment\nof dividends (including reducing or\neliminating anticipated accelerations or\nincreases in the payment of dividends), which\nmay adversely affect the Fund. Issuer Risk .\nThe performance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Management Risk . The\nFund generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets. As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the Underlying\nIndex, it is subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of BFA may not produce the\nintended results. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund\u2019s investment results will have a high\ndegree of correlation to those of the\nUnderlying Index or that the Fund will achieve\nits investment objective. Market Trading Risk\n. The Fund faces numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The Fund is exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-9\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Index returns beginning on November\n3, 2016 reflect the performance of the FTSE\nNareit Equity REITs Index, which, effective as\nof November 3, 2016, replaced the FTSE Nareit\nReal Estate 50 Index as the Underlying Index\nof the Fund. After-tax returns in the table\nabove are calculated using the historical\nhighest individual U.S. federal marginal\nincome tax rates and do not reflect the impact\nof state or local taxes. Actual after-tax\nreturns depend on an investor\u2019s tax situation\nand may differ from those shown, and after-tax\nreturns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt\ninvestors or investors who hold shares through\ntax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k)\nplans or individual retirement accounts ( \u201c\nIRAs \u201d ). Fund returns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund shares are\ncalculated assuming that an investor has\nsufficient capital gains of the same character\nfrom other investments to offset any capital\nlosses from the sales of Fund shares. As a\nresult, Fund returns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund shares may\nexceed Fund returns before taxes and/or\nreturns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-10\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-11\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. BASIC MATERIALS ETF Ticker: IYM\nStock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective\nThe iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF (the \u201c\nFund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment results\nof an index composed of U.S. equities in the\nbasic materials sector.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $40        $125     $219      $493  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 11% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Russell 1000 Basic Materials RIC 22.5/45\nCapped Index (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ),\nwhich measures the performance of the basic\nmaterials sector of the U.S. equity market, as\ndefined by FTSE Russell (the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d or \u201c Russell \u201d ). The Underlying Index\nincludes large- and mid-capitalization\ncompanies. The Underlying Index is a subset of\nthe Russell 1000 Index, which is a float-\nadjusted capitalization-weighted index of\nequity securities issued by approximately the\n1,000 largest issuers in the Russell 3000\nIndex. The Russell 3000 Index measures the\nperformance of the broad U.S. equity market,\nas defined by Russell. The Underlying Index\nuses a capping methodology to constrain at\nquarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any\nsingle issuer (as determined by Russell) to a\nmaximum of 22.5%, and (ii) the aggregate\nweight of all issuers that individually exceed\n4.5% of the index weight to a maximum of 45%.\nThe weight of one or more securities in the\nUnderlying Index may exceed these constraints\ndue to fluctuations in market value, corporate\nactions, or other events that change the index\ncomposition between quarterly rebalance dates.\nSubstantially all of the Underlying Index is\nexpected to be represented by securities of\ncompanies in the basic materials industry or\nsector. The components of the Underlying Index\nare likely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. S-12\n\nIndexing may eliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially outperform the\nUnderlying Index but also may reduce some of\nthe risks of active management, such as poor\nsecurity selection. Indexing seeks to achieve\nlower costs and better after-tax performance\nby aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Russell, which is part of the London Stock\nExchange Group and is independent of the Fund\nand BFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Materials Companies\nRisk . Materials companies may be adversely\naffected by volatility in commodity prices,\nchanges in exchange rates, social and\npolitical unrest, war, depletion of resources,\nlower demand, overproduction, litigation and\ngovernment regulations, among other factors.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with S-13 the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Non-\nDiversification Risk . The Fund is classified\nas \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means that,\ncompared with funds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a greater\npercentage of its assets in securities or\nother instruments representing a small number\nof issuers or counterparties and thus may be\nmore susceptible to the risks associated with\nthese particular issuers or counterparties. As\na result, the Fund's performance may depend to\na greater extent on the performance of a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties, which may\nlead to more volatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may S-14 be heightened during times\nof increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions.

The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

Index returns beginning\non September 20, 2021 reflect the performance\nof the Russell 1000 Basic Materials RIC\n22.5/45 Capped Index, which, effective as of\nSeptember 20, 2021, replaced the Dow Jones\nU.S. Basic Materials Index as the Underlying\nIndex of the Fund. After-tax returns in the\ntable above are calculated using the\nhistorical highest individual U.S. federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state or local taxes. Actual\nafter-tax returns depend on an investor\u2019s tax\nsituation and may differ from those shown, and\nafter-tax returns shown are not relevant to\ntax-exempt investors or investors who hold\nshares through tax-deferred arrangements, such\nas 401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ). Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares are calculated assuming that an\ninvestor has sufficient capital gains of the\nsame character from other investments to\noffset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-16\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-17\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY ETF\nTicker: IYC Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca\nInvestment Objective The iShares U.S. Consumer\nDiscretionary ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to\ntrack the investment results of an index\ncomposed of U.S. equities in the consumer\ndiscretionary sector.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $40        $125     $219      $493  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 11% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Russell 1000 Consumer Discretionary 40 Act\n15/22.5 Daily Capped Index (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ), which measures the performance of\nthe consumer discretionary sector of the U.S.\nequity market, as defined by FTSE Russell (the\n\u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c Russell \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index includes large- and mid-\ncapitalization companies. The Underlying Index\nis a subset of the Russell 1000 Index, which\nis a float-adjusted capitalization-weighted\nindex of equity securities issued by\napproximately the 1,000 largest issuers in the\nRussell 3000 Index. The Russell 3000 Index\nmeasures the performance of the broad U.S.\nequity market, as defined by Russell. The\nIndex Provider classifies the Consumer\nDiscretionary industry as including companies\nwhose businesses tend to be the most sensitive\nto economic cycles and whose customers'\npurchasing habits are considered cyclical in\nnature. The Consumer Discretionary industry\nincludes companies that manufacture and\ndistribute household durable goods, apparel,\nhome electronic devices, leisure equipment,\nand automotive and related parts. The services\nsegment of Consumer Discretionary includes\nhotels, restaurants, retail/e-retail,\npassenger transportation, other leisure\nfacilities and media companies that engage in\nentertainment content creation and traditional\nadvertisement. The Underlying Index uses a\ncapping methodology to constrain at quarterly\nrebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer\n(as determined by Russell) to a maximum of\n15%, and (ii) the aggregate weight of all\nissuers that individually exceed 4.5% of the\nindex weight to a maximum of 22.5%. Between\nscheduled quarterly index reviews, the\nUnderlying Index is monitored daily using\nconstituent weights and forward looking\ninformation to ensure all companies that\nconstitute more than 4.8% of the weight S-18\n\nof the Underlying Index do not constitute more\nthan 24% of the weight of the Underlying Index\nin the aggregate on a future date. On the\ncalculation day where the threshold has been\nbreached, the index is recapped using the\nquarterly capping methodology. Substantially\nall of the Underlying Index is expected to be\nrepresented by securities of companies in the\nconsumer discretionary industry or sector. The\ncomponents of the Underlying Index are likely\nto change over time. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Russell, which is part of the London Stock\nExchange Group and is independent of the Fund\nand BFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Consumer goods and\nservices companies ( \u201c consumer companies \u201d )\nface risks related to changes in consumer\npreferences and disposable income, commodity\nprices, government regulation, supply chain\ndisruptions, damage to brand or reputation,\neconomic slowdown and labor shortages, among\nother things. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider S-19 or a third-\nparty data provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions S-20 carried out to\nminimize the distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions.

Index returns\nfrom June 24, 2019 through September 19, 2021\nreflect the performance of the Dow Jones U.S.\nConsumer Services Capped Index. Index returns\nbeginning on September 20, 2021 reflect the\nperformance of the Russell 1000 Consumer\nDiscretionary 40 Act 15/22.5 Daily Capped\nIndex, which, effective as of September 20,\n2021, replaced the Dow Jones U.S. Consumer\nServices Capped Index as the Underlying Index\nof the Fund. After-tax returns in the table\nabove are calculated using the historical\nhighest individual U.S. federal marginal\nincome tax rates and do not reflect the impact\nof state or local taxes. Actual after-tax\nreturns depend on an investor\u2019s tax situation\nand may differ from those shown, and after-tax\nreturns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt\ninvestors or investors who hold shares through\ntax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k)\nplans or individual retirement accounts ( \u201c\nIRAs \u201d ). Fund returns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund shares are\ncalculated assuming that an investor has\nsufficient capital gains of the same character\nfrom other investments to offset any capital\nlosses from the sales of Fund shares. As a\nresult, Fund returns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund shares may\nexceed Fund returns before taxes and/or\nreturns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-22\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-23\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. CONSUMER STAPLES ETF Ticker:\nIYK Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment\nObjective The iShares U.S. Consumer Staples\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the\ninvestment results of an index composed of\nU.S. equities in the consumer staples sector.\nFees and Expenses The following table\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you will\nincur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $41        $128     $224      $505  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 8% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Russell 1000 Consumer Staples RIC 22.5/45\nCapped Index (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ),\nwhich measures the performance of the consumer\nstaples sector of the U.S. equity market, as\ndefined by FTSE Russell (the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d or \u201c Russell \u201d ). The Underlying Index\nincludes large- and mid-capitalization\ncompanies. The Underlying Index is a subset of\nthe Russell 1000 Index, which is a float-\nadjusted capitalization-weighted index of\nequity securities issued by approximately the\n1,000 largest issuers in the Russell 3000\nIndex. The Russell 3000 Index measures the\nperformance of the broad U.S. equity market,\nas defined by Russell. The Index Provider\nclassifies the \u201c Consumer Staples \u201d industry\nas including companies whose businesses tend\nto be less sensitive to economic cycles and\nwhose customers\u2019 purchasing habits are non-\ncyclical in nature. The Consumer Staples\nindustry includes companies that manufacture,\ndistribute, and/or retail food, beverages,\nother non-durable household goods, drug-\nretailing companies as well as agriculture,\nfishing, ranching and milling companies. The\nUnderlying Index uses a capping methodology to\nconstrain at quarterly rebalance: (i) the\nweight of any single issuer (as determined by\nRussell) to a maximum of 22.5%, and (ii) the\naggregate weight of all issuers that\nindividually exceed 4.5% of the index weight\nto a maximum of 45%. The weight of one or more\nsecurities in the Underlying Index may exceed\nthese constraints due to fluctuations in\nmarket value, corporate actions, or other\nevents that change the index composition\nbetween quarterly rebalance dates. S-24\n\nSubstantially all of the Underlying Index is\nexpected to be represented by securities of\ncompanies in the consumer staples industry or\nsector. The components of the Underlying Index\nare likely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Russell, which is part of the London Stock\nExchange Group and is independent of the Fund\nand BFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Consumer goods and\nservices companies ( \u201c consumer companies \u201d )\nface risks related to changes in consumer\npreferences and disposable income, commodity\nprices, government regulation, supply chain\ndisruptions, damage to brand or reputation,\neconomic slowdown and labor shortages, among\nother things. Equity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes in value,\nand their values may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number of reasons\nthat may directly relate to the issuer as well\nas due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. S-25\nAsset Class Risk. The securities and other\nassets in the Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may underperform in\ncomparison to financial markets generally, a\nparticular financial market, another index, or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Non-\nDiversification Risk . The Fund is classified\nas \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means that,\ncompared with funds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a greater\npercentage of its assets in securities or\nother instruments representing a small number\nof issuers or counterparties and thus may be\nmore susceptible to the risks associated with\nthese particular issuers or counterparties. As\na result, the Fund's performance may depend to\na greater extent on the performance of a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties, which may\nlead to more volatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe S-26 Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-27\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Index returns beginning\non September 20, 2021 reflect the performance\nof the Russell 1000 Consumer Staples RIC\n22.5/45 Capped Index, which, effective as of\nSeptember 20, 2021, replaced the Dow Jones\nU.S. Consumer Goods Index as the Underlying\nIndex of the Fund. After-tax returns in the\ntable above are calculated using the\nhistorical highest individual U.S. federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state or local taxes. Actual\nafter-tax returns depend on an investor\u2019s tax\nsituation and may differ from those shown, and\nafter-tax returns shown are not relevant to\ntax-exempt investors or investors who hold\nshares through tax-deferred arrangements, such\nas 401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ). Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares are calculated assuming that an\ninvestor has sufficient capital gains of the\nsame character from other investments to\noffset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-28\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-29\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. ENERGY ETF Ticker: IYE Stock\nExchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective The\niShares U.S. Energy ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks\nto track the investment results of an index\ncomposed of U.S. equities in the energy\nsector.

Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $40        $125     $219      $493  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 10% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Russell 1000 Energy RIC 22.5/45 Capped\nIndex (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which\nmeasures the performance of the energy sector\nof the U.S. equity market, as defined by FTSE\nRussell (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c Russell \u201d\n). The Underlying Index includes large- and\nmid-capitalization companies. The Underlying\nIndex is a subset of the Russell 1000 Index,\nwhich is a float-adjusted capitalization-\nweighted index of equity securities issued by\napproximately the 1,000 largest issuers in the\nRussell 3000 Index. The Russell 3000 Index\nmeasures the performance of the broad U.S.\nequity market, as defined by Russell. The\nUnderlying Index uses a capping methodology to\nconstrain at quarterly rebalance: (i) the\nweight of any single issuer (as determined by\nRussell) to a maximum of 22.5%, and (ii) the\naggregate weight of all issuers that\nindividually exceed 4.5% of the index weight\nto a maximum of 45%. The weight of one or more\nsecurities in the Underlying Index may exceed\nthese constraints due to fluctuations in\nmarket value, corporate actions, or other\nevents that change the index composition\nbetween quarterly rebalance dates.\nSubstantially all of the Underlying Index is\nexpected to be represented by securities of\ncompanies in the energy industry or sector.\nThe components of the Underlying Index are\nlikely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. S-30\n\nIndexing may eliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially outperform the\nUnderlying Index but also may reduce some of\nthe risks of active management, such as poor\nsecurity selection. Indexing seeks to achieve\nlower costs and better after-tax performance\nby aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Russell, which is part of the London Stock\nExchange Group and is independent of the Fund\nand BFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Energy Companies Risk.\nCompanies in the energy sector may be\nadversely affected by volatility in energy and\ncommodity prices, lower demand,\noverproduction, depletion of resources, social\nand political unrest, war, trade disputes,\ngovernment regulations and energy transition\nefforts, among other factors. The energy\nsector is cyclical and can be significantly\nimpacted by changes in economic conditions.\nSome energy companies, such as those in the\noil and gas sector, face substantial costs\nrelated to exploration and production and\nsignificant operational risks. Energy\ncompanies are at risk of environmental damage\nclaims and other litigation. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer as well as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. S-31 Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Non-\nDiversification Risk . The Fund is classified\nas \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means that,\ncompared with funds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a greater\npercentage of its assets in securities or\nother instruments representing a small number\nof issuers or counterparties and thus may be\nmore susceptible to the risks associated with\nthese particular issuers or counterparties. As\na result, the Fund's performance may depend to\na greater extent on the performance of a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties, which may\nlead to more volatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nS-32 in the timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or interest received by\nthe Fund or distributions paid to Fund\nshareholders; tax gains or losses; the\nrequirements for the Fund to maintain pass-\nthrough tax treatment; portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the distribution of\ncapital gains to shareholders; the acceptance\nof custom baskets; changes to the Underlying\nIndex; and impacts to the Fund of complying\nwith certain regulatory requirements or\nlimits. Tracking error risk may be heightened\nduring times of increased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions. S-33\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Index returns beginning on\nSeptember 20, 2021 reflect the performance of\nthe Russell 1000 Energy RIC 22.5/45 Capped\nIndex, which, effective as of September 20,\n2021, replaced the Dow Jones U.S. Oil & Gas\nIndex as the Underlying Index of the Fund.\nAfter-tax returns in the table above are\ncalculated using the historical highest\nindividual U.S. federal marginal income tax\nrates and do not reflect the impact of state\nor local taxes. Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-34\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-35\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES ETF Ticker:\nIYG Stock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment\nObjective The iShares U.S. Financial Services\nETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d ) seeks to track the\ninvestment results of an index composed of\nU.S. equities in the financial services\nsector.

You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.39%     None       0.00%       0.39%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $40        $125     $219      $493  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 18% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Dow Jones U.S. Financial Services Index\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which measures\nthe performance of the financial services\nsector of the U.S. equity market. The\nUnderlying Index is a subset of the Dow Jones\nU.S. Index ( \u201c Parent Index \u201d ) and includes\ncomponents of the following subsectors in the\nParent Index: banks, asset managers, consumer\nfinance, specialty finance, investments\nservices and mortgage finance. The Underlying\nIndex includes large-, mid- and small-\ncapitalization companies and may change over\ntime. As of April 30, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the financials\nindustry or sector. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the Fund\ndoes not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), S-36\n\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c SPDJI \u201d ), which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and publishes information\nregarding the market value of the Underlying\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. S-37 Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Non-Diversification Risk . The Fund is\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means\nthat, compared with funds that are classified\nas \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a\ngreater percentage of its assets in securities\nor other instruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties and thus\nmay be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-38\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-39\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-40\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. FINANCIALS ETF Ticker: IYF\nStock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective\nThe iShares U.S. Financials ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d\n) seeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of U.S. equities in the\nfinancials sector. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.39%     None       0.00%       0.39%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $40        $125     $219      $493  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 6% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Russell 1000 Financials 40 Act 15/22.5\nDaily Capped Index (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d\n), which measures the performance of the\nfinancials sector of the U.S. equity market,\nas defined by FTSE Russell (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c Russell \u201d ). The Underlying\nIndex includes large- and mid-capitalization\ncompanies. The Underlying Index is a subset of\nthe Russell 1000 Index, which is a float-\nadjusted capitalization-weighted index of\nequity securities issued by approximately the\n1,000 largest issuers in the Russell 3000\nIndex. The Russell 3000 Index measures the\nperformance of the broad U.S. equity market,\nas defined by Russell. The Underlying Index\nuses a capping methodology to constrain at\nquarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any\nsingle issuer (as determined by Russell) to a\nmaximum of 15%, and (ii) the aggregate weight\nof all issuers that individually exceed 4.5%\nof the index weight to a maximum of 22.5%.\nBetween scheduled quarterly index reviews, the\nUnderlying Index is monitored daily using\nconstituent weights and forward looking\ninformation to ensure all companies that\nconstitute more than 4.8% of the weight of the\nUnderlying Index do not constitute more than\n24% of the weight of the Underlying Index in\nthe aggregate. On the calculation day where\nthe threshold has been breached, the index is\nrecapped using the quarterly capping\nmethodology. Substantially all of the\nUnderlying Index is expected to be represented\nby securities of companies in the financials\nindustry or sector. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the S-41\n\nFund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it\ntracks and does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Russell, which is part of the London Stock\nExchange Group and is independent of the Fund\nand BFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Financial Companies\nRisk . Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation\nand intervention, which may adversely affect\ntheir profitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and their size, among other things.\nFinancial services companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among other things,\ninterest rates, economic conditions,\nvolatility in financial markets, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and counterparty risk.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in S-42 comparison\nto financial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may S-43 be heightened during times\nof increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. S-44\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions.

Index returns from June 24,\n2019 through September 19, 2021 reflect the\nperformance of the Dow Jones U.S. Financials\nCapped Index. Index returns beginning on\nSeptember 20, 2021 reflect the performance of\nthe Russell 1000 Financials 40 Act 15/22.5\nDaily Capped Index, which, effective as of\nSeptember 20, 2021, replaced the Dow Jones\nU.S. Financials Capped Index as the Underlying\nIndex of the Fund. After-tax returns in the\ntable above are calculated using the\nhistorical highest individual U.S. federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state or local taxes. Actual\nafter-tax returns depend on an investor\u2019s tax\nsituation and may differ from those shown, and\nafter-tax returns shown are not relevant to\ntax-exempt investors or investors who hold\nshares through tax-deferred arrangements, such\nas 401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ). Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares are calculated assuming that an\ninvestor has sufficient capital gains of the\nsame character from other investments to\noffset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-45\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-46\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. HEALTHCARE ETF Ticker: IYH\nStock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective\nThe iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d\n) seeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of U.S. equities in the\nhealthcare sector. Fees and Expenses The\nfollowing table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $40        $125     $219      $493  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 5% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Russell 1000 Health Care RIC 22.5/45\nCapped Index (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ),\nwhich measures the performance of the\nhealthcare sector of the U.S. equity market,\nas defined by FTSE Russell (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c Russell \u201d ). The Underlying\nIndex includes large- and mid-capitalization\ncompanies. The Underlying Index is a subset of\nthe Russell 1000 Index, which is a float-\nadjusted capitalization-weighted index of\nequity securities issued by approximately the\n1,000 largest issuers in the Russell 3000\nIndex. The Russell 3000 Index measures the\nperformance of the broad U.S. equity market,\nas defined by Russell. The Underlying Index\nuses a capping methodology to constrain at\nquarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any\nsingle issuer (as determined by Russell) to a\nmaximum of 22.5%, and (ii) the aggregate\nweight of all issuers that individually exceed\n4.5% of the index weight to a maximum of 45%.\nThe weight of one or more securities in the\nUnderlying Index may exceed these constraints\ndue to fluctuations in market value, corporate\nactions, or other events that change the index\ncomposition between quarterly rebalance dates.\nSubstantially all of the Underlying Index is\nexpected to be represented by securities of\ncompanies in the healthcare industry or\nsector. The components of the Underlying Index\nare likely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. S-47\n\nIndexing may eliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially outperform the\nUnderlying Index but also may reduce some of\nthe risks of active management, such as poor\nsecurity selection. Indexing seeks to achieve\nlower costs and better after-tax performance\nby aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Russell, which is part of the London Stock\nExchange Group and is independent of the Fund\nand BFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Healthcare Companies\nRisk . The profitability of healthcare\ncompanies may be adversely affected by\nextensive government regulations, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising costs of medical products and\nservices, pricing pressure, the protection and\nexpiration of patents, limited product lines,\nsupply chain issues, labor shortages and\nproduct liability claims, among other factors.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of S-48 creation units\n( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Non-Diversification Risk . The Fund is\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means\nthat, compared with funds that are classified\nas \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a\ngreater percentage of its assets in securities\nor other instruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties and thus\nmay be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-49\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect. Past performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily indicate how\nthe Fund will perform in the future.Updated\nperformance information, including the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent NAV, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.comor by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).

After-tax returns in the table above are\ncalculated using the historical highest\nindividual U.S. federal marginal income tax\nrates and do not reflect the impact of state\nor local taxes. Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-50\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-51\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. INDUSTRIALS ETF Ticker: IYJ\nStock Exchange: Cboe BZX Investment Objective\nThe iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d\n) seeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of U.S. equities in the\nindustrials sector.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $40        $125     $219      $493  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d\nits portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 4% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Russell 1000 Industrials 40 Act 15/22.5\nDaily Capped Index (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d\n), which measures the performance of the\nindustrials sector of the U.S. equity market,\nas defined by FTSE Russell (the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d or \u201c Russell \u201d ). The Underlying\nIndex includes large- and mid-capitalization\ncompanies. The Underlying Index is a subset of\nthe Russell 1000 Index, which is a float-\nadjusted capitalization-weighted index of\nequity securities issued by approximately the\n1,000 largest issuers in the Russell 3000\nIndex. The Russell 3000 Index measures the\nperformance of the broad U.S. equity market,\nas defined by Russell. The Underlying Index\nuses a capping methodology to constrain at\nquarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any\nsingle issuer (as determined by Russell) to a\nmaximum of 15%, and (ii) the aggregate weight\nof all issuers that individually exceed 4.5%\nof the index weight to a maximum of 22.5%.\nBetween scheduled quarterly index reviews, the\nUnderlying Index is monitored daily using\nconstituent weights and forward looking\ninformation to ensure all companies that\nconstitute more than 4.8% of the weight of the\nUnderlying Index do not constitute more than\n24% of the weight of the Underlying Index in\nthe aggregate. On the calculation day where\nthe threshold has been breached, the index is\nrecapped using the quarterly capping\nmethodology. Substantially all of the\nUnderlying Index is expected to be represented\nby securities of companies in the industrials\nindustry or sector. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies, the S-52\n\nFund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d the index it\ntracks and does not seek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or appear\novervalued. Indexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially outperform\nthe Underlying Index but also may reduce some\nof the risks of active management, such as\npoor security selection. Indexing seeks to\nachieve lower costs and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Russell, which is part of the London Stock\nExchange Group and is independent of the Fund\nand BFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Industrial Companies\nRisk. Industrial companies face a number of\nrisks, including supply chain and distribution\ndisruptions, business interruptions, product\nobsolescence, third-party vendor risks, cyber\nattacks, trade disputes, product recalls,\nliability claims, scarcity of materials or\nparts, excess capacity, changes in consumer\npreferences, and volatility in commodity\nprices and currencies. The performance of such\ncompanies may also be affected by\ntechnological developments, labor relations,\nlegislative and regulatory changes, government\nspending policies, and changes in domestic and\ninternational economies. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer as well as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in S-53 comparison\nto financial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may S-54 be heightened during times\nof increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions.

After-tax returns in the table\nabove are calculated using the historical\nhighest individual U.S. federal marginal\nincome tax rates and do not reflect the impact\nof state or local taxes. Actual after-tax\nreturns depend on an investor\u2019s tax situation\nand may differ from those shown, and after-tax\nreturns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt\ninvestors or investors who hold shares through\ntax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k)\nplans or individual retirement accounts ( \u201c\nIRAs \u201d ). Fund returns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund shares are\ncalculated assuming that an investor has\nsufficient capital gains of the same character\nfrom other investments to offset any capital\nlosses from the sales of Fund shares. As a\nresult, Fund returns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund shares may\nexceed Fund returns before taxes and/or\nreturns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-56\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-57\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. TECHNOLOGY ETF Ticker: IYW\nStock Exchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective\nThe iShares U.S. Technology ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d\n) seeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of U.S. equities in the\ntechnology sector.

Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $40        $125     $219      $493  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 11% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped\nIndex (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which\nmeasures the performance of the technology\nsector of the U.S. equity market, as defined\nby FTSE Russell (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c\nRussell \u201d ). The Underlying Index includes\nlarge- and mid-capitalization companies. The\nUnderlying Index is a subset of the Russell\n1000 Index, which is a float-adjusted\ncapitalization-weighted index of equity\nsecurities issued by approximately the 1,000\nlargest issuers in the Russell 3000 Index. The\nRussell 3000 Index measures the performance of\nthe broad U.S. equity market, as defined by\nRussell. The Underlying Index uses a capping\nmethodology to constrain at quarterly\nrebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer\n(as determined by Russell) to a maximum of\n22.5%, and (ii) the aggregate weight of all\nissuers that individually exceed 4.5% of the\nindex weight to a maximum of 45%. The weight\nof one or more securities in the Underlying\nIndex may exceed these constraints due to\nfluctuations in market value, corporate\nactions, or other events that change the index\ncomposition between quarterly rebalance dates.\nSubstantially all of the Underlying Index is\nexpected to be represented by securities of\ncompanies in the technology industry or\nsector. The components of the Underlying Index\nare likely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. S-58\n\nIndexing may eliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially outperform the\nUnderlying Index but also may reduce some of\nthe risks of active management, such as poor\nsecurity selection. Indexing seeks to achieve\nlower costs and better after-tax performance\nby aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Russell, which is part of the London Stock\nExchange Group and is independent of the Fund\nand BFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Technology Companies\nRisk . Technology companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technological advances may\nhave limited product lines, markets, financial\nresources, supply chains and personnel. These\ncompanies typically face intense competition,\npotentially rapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and customer\npreferences. They may face unexpected risks\nand costs associated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on intellectual property\nrights and may be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those rights. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer as well as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in S-59 comparison\nto financial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Non-Diversification Risk . The Fund is\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means\nthat, compared with funds that are classified\nas \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a\ngreater percentage of its assets in securities\nor other instruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties and thus\nmay be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the S-60 Underlying Index;\nand impacts to the Fund of complying with\ncertain regulatory requirements or limits.\nTracking error risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. S-61\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Index returns from June 24,\n2019 through September 19, 2021 reflect the\nperformance of the Dow Jones U.S. Technology\nCapped Index. Index returns beginning on\nSeptember 20, 2021 reflect the performance of\nthe Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped\nIndex, which, effective as of September 20,\n2021, replaced the Dow Jones U.S. Technology\nCapped Index as the Underlying Index of the\nFund. After-tax returns in the table above are\ncalculated using the historical highest\nindividual U.S. federal marginal income tax\nrates and do not reflect the impact of state\nor local taxes. Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-62\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-63\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. TRANSPORTATION ETF Ticker: IYT\nStock Exchange: Cboe BZX Investment Objective\nThe iShares U.S. Transportation ETF (the \u201c\nFund \u201d ) seeks to track the investment results\nof an index composed of U.S. equities in the\ntransportation sector.

The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 11% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe S&P Transportation Select Industry FMC\nCapped Index (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ),\nwhich measures the performance of companies\nwithin the transportation sector of the U.S.\nequity market as determined by S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c SPDJI\n\u201d ). The Underlying Index may include large-,\nmid- and small-capitalization companies.\nSecurities in the Underlying Index are\nweighted based on the float-adjusted market\nvalue of their outstanding shares. The\nUnderlying Index uses a capping methodology to\nconstrain at quarterly rebalance: (i) the\nweight of any single issuer (as determined by\nSPDJI) to a maximum of 22.5%, and (ii) the\naggregate weight of all issuers that\nindividually exceed 4.5% of the index weight\nto a maximum of 45%. The weight of one or more\nsecurities in the Underlying Index may exceed\nthese constraints due to fluctuations in\nmarket value, corporate actions, or other\nevents that change the index composition\nbetween quarterly rebalance dates. As of April\n30, 2024, substantially all of the Underlying\nIndex is represented by securities of\ncompanies in the transportation industry or\nsector. The components of the Underlying Index\nare likely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax S-64\n\nperformance by aiming to keep portfolio\nturnover low in comparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy to\nmanage the Fund. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d\nis an indexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative sample of\nsecurities that collectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an applicable\nunderlying index. The securities selected are\nexpected to have, in the aggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors such as\nmarket capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund generally will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby SPDJI, which is independent of the Fund and\nBFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Transportation\nCompanies Risk. Transportation companies may\nbe adversely affected by changes in the\neconomy, volatility in energy prices, labor\nrelations, business interruptions, supply\nchain disruptions, trade disputes, technology\ndevelopments, exchange rates, insurance costs\nand government regulation. Securities of\ntransportation companies are generally\ncyclical and may have sharp price movements.\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of other asset\nclasses. The value of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as due to general\nindustry or market conditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred securities and debt\nin a company\u2019s capital structure. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority, and the greatest\nrisk, with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market Risk . The Fund\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues, recessions, the\nprospect or occurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could result in\nincreased premiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Index-Related Risk. The Index Provider\nmay rely on various sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including information that\nmay be based on assumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances\nthat the Index Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included components.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized S-65 Participant\nis obligated to engage in creation or\nredemption transactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the business or\ndo not place creation or redemption orders for\nthe Fund and no other Authorized Participant\nplaces orders, Fund shares are more likely to\ntrade at a premium or discount to NAV and\npossibly face trading halts or delisting.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Non-Diversification Risk . The Fund is\nclassified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means\nthat, compared with funds that are classified\nas \u201c diversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a\ngreater percentage of its assets in securities\nor other instruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties and thus\nmay be more susceptible to the risks\nassociated with these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend to a greater extent on\nthe performance of a small number of issuers\nor counterparties, which may lead to more\nvolatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV. Operational Risk\n. The Fund is exposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error, processing\nand communication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund\nand BFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage in\nsecurities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities\nfails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline in the value\nof collateral provided for loaned securities\nor a decline in the value of any investments\nmade with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the Underlying Index. Tracking error may\noccur due to a number of factors, including\ndifferences between the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions.

Index returns\nbeginning on July 19, 2021 reflect the\nperformance of the S&P Transportation Select\nIndustry FMC Capped Index, which, effective as\nof July 19, 2021, replaced the Dow Jones\nTransportation Average Index as the Underlying\nIndex of the Fund. After-tax returns in the\ntable above are calculated using the\nhistorical highest individual U.S. federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state or local taxes. Actual\nafter-tax returns depend on an investor\u2019s tax\nsituation and may differ from those shown, and\nafter-tax returns shown are not relevant to\ntax-exempt investors or investors who hold\nshares through tax-deferred arrangements, such\nas 401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ). Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares are calculated assuming that an\ninvestor has sufficient capital gains of the\nsame character from other investments to\noffset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-67\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-68\n\niSHARES \u00ae U.S. UTILITIES ETF Ticker: IDU Stock\nExchange: NYSE Arca Investment Objective The\niShares U.S. Utilities ETF (the \u201c Fund \u201d )\nseeks to track the investment results of an\nindex composed of U.S. equities in the\nutilities sector.

You may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other fees to\nfinancial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the tables and examples below.\n                                              \n            Annual                            \n            Fund                              \n            Operating                         \n            Expenses\u2026                         \n            expenses                          \n            that you                          \n            pay each                          \n            year as                           \n            apercent\u2026                         \n            of the                            \n            value of                          \n            your                              \n            investme\u2026                         \n            Distribu\u2026              Total      \n  Managem\u2026  Service(\u2026  OtherExpe\u2026  AnnualFu\u2026  \n            Fees                              \n  0.39%     None       0.00%       0.39%      \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired\nfund fees and expenses, if any. 2 The amount\nrounded to 0.00%. Example. This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes\nthat you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the\ntime periods indicated and then sell all of\nyour shares at the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the same. Although\nyour actual costs may be higher or lower,\nbased on these assumptions, your costs would\nbe:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $40        $125     $219      $493  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may pay\ntransaction costs, such as commissions, when\nit buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or in the Example, affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. During the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 4% of the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The\nFund seeks to track the investment results of\nthe Russell 1000 Utilities RIC 22.5/45 Capped\nIndex (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which\nmeasures the performance of the utilities\nsector of the U.S. equity market, as defined\nby FTSE Russell (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c\nRussell \u201d ). The Underlying Index includes\nlarge- and mid-capitalization companies. The\nUnderlying Index is a subset of the Russell\n1000 Index, which is a float-adjusted\ncapitalization-weighted index of equity\nsecurities issued by approximately the 1,000\nlargest issuers in the Russell 3000 Index. The\nRussell 3000 Index measures the performance of\nthe broad U.S. equity market, as defined by\nRussell. The Underlying Index uses a capping\nmethodology to constrain at quarterly\nrebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer\n(as determined by Russell) to a maximum of\n22.5%, and (ii) the aggregate weight of all\nissuers that individually exceed 4.5% of the\nindex weight to a maximum of 45%. The weight\nof one or more securities in the Underlying\nIndex may exceed these constraints due to\nfluctuations in market value, corporate\nactions, or other events that change the index\ncomposition between quarterly rebalance dates.\nSubstantially all of the Underlying Index is\nexpected to be represented by securities of\ncompanies in the utilities industry or sector.\nThe components of the Underlying Index are\nlikely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. S-69\n\nIndexing may eliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially outperform the\nUnderlying Index but also may reduce some of\nthe risks of active management, such as poor\nsecurity selection. Indexing seeks to achieve\nlower costs and better after-tax performance\nby aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not hold all of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing up to one-\nthird of the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is sponsored\nby Russell, which is part of the London Stock\nExchange Group and is independent of the Fund\nand BFA. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding the market\nvalue of the Underlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries to\napproximately the same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow,any of which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ),\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with others\nfollowing in alphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk is difficult\nto predict and may change over time. You\nshould review each risk factor carefully. Risk\nof Investing in the U.S . Investing in U.S.\nissuers subjects the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S.\nCertain changes in the U.S., such as a\nweakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in\nits financial markets, may have an adverse\neffect on U.S. issuers. Utility Companies\nRisk. The utilities sector is generally\nsubject to significant government regulation\nand oversight, including restrictions on rates\nas well as environmental and other\nregulations. Utility companies also may face\nrisks related to, among other things, natural\ndisasters, cyber or other attacks, capital\nproject funding, energy price volatility and\nincreased competition. Equity Securities Risk\n. Equity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue, and their values may be more volatile\nthan those of other asset classes. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of\nreasons that may directly relate to the issuer\nas well as due to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure. Common stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk, with respect\nto dividends and any liquidation payments in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other financial crisis,\nor other events could have a significant\nimpact on the Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. The Index Provider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess the criteria\nof components of the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund\nnor BFA can offer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur, and\nthe Index Provider may not identify or correct\nthem promptly or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political unrest or war)\nmay impact the Index Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the Index\nProvider to postpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and other assets in\nthe Underlying Index or in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index, or other\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d is a member or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the Fund or one\nof its service providers that allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of S-70 creation units\n( \u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Concentration\nRisk. The Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including losses due\nto adverse events that affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments more than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or other assets\nof one or more issuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets, industries, project\ntypes, or asset classes. Cybersecurity Risk .\nFailures or breaches of the electronic systems\nof the Fund, its adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of assets in which\nthe Fund invests may cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. The Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems of\nits service providers, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value. Dividend-Paying\nStock Risk . Investing in dividend-paying\nstocks involves the risk that such stocks may\nfall out of favor with investors and\nunderperform other types of stocks or the\nbroader market. Companies that issue dividend-\npaying stocks are not required to pay or\ncontinue paying dividends on such stocks. It\nis possible that issuers of the stocks held by\nthe Fund will not declare dividends in the\nfuture or will reduce or eliminate the payment\nof dividends (including reducing or\neliminating anticipated accelerations or\nincreases in the payment of dividends), which\nmay adversely affect the Fund. Issuer Risk .\nThe performance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Management Risk . The Fund generally\ndoes not attempt to take defensive positions\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. As the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of BFA may not\nproduce the intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment results\nwill have a high degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or that the Fund\nwill achieve its investment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces numerous market\ntrading risks, including the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares (including\nthrough a trading halt), losses from trading\nin secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility, and disruptions in the process of\ncreating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading in the secondary market\nat a premium or discount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. If you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to NAV\nor sell Fund shares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of the Fund\nshares. Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater investment in\nlarge-capitalization stocks. Non-\nDiversification Risk . The Fund is classified\nas \u201c non-diversified. \u201d This means that,\ncompared with funds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified, \u201d the Fund may invest a greater\npercentage of its assets in securities or\nother instruments representing a small number\nof issuers or counterparties and thus may be\nmore susceptible to the risks associated with\nthese particular issuers or counterparties. As\na result, the Fund's performance may depend to\na greater extent on the performance of a small\nnumber of issuers or counterparties, which may\nlead to more volatility in the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third parties, failed\nor inadequate processes and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to\nreduce these operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However, these\nmeasures do not address every possible risk\nand may be inadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Securities Lending Risk.\nThe Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund may be subject\nto \u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other S-71 assets\nheld in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by the Fund that\nthe Underlying Index does not incur; the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash; differences\nin the timing of the accrual or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to Fund shareholders;\ntax gains or losses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index; and\nimpacts to the Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. Tracking\nerror risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. S-72\n\nPerformance Information The performance\ninformation below illustrates how the Fund\u2019s\nperformance has varied over different periods\nand provides some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how\nthe performance of the Fund has varied from\none calendar year to another over the periods\nshown.The table compares the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to that of an appropriate broad-\nbased securities market index and the\nUnderlying Index. Fund returns assume the\nreinvestment of any dividends and\ndistributions. The Fund\u2019s returns reflect the\nimpact of any agreements to waive or reimburse\nexpenses, which would reduce performance if\nnot in effect.

Index returns beginning on\nSeptember 20, 2021 reflect the performance of\nthe Russell 1000 Utilities RIC 22.5/45 Capped\nIndex, which, effective as of September 20,\n2021, replaced the Dow Jones U.S. Utilities\nIndex as the Underlying Index of the Fund.\nAfter-tax returns in the table above are\ncalculated using the historical highest\nindividual U.S. federal marginal income tax\nrates and do not reflect the impact of state\nor local taxes. Actual after-tax returns\ndepend on an investor\u2019s tax situation and may\ndiffer from those shown, and after-tax returns\nshown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors\nor investors who hold shares through tax-\ndeferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts ( \u201c IRAs \u201d ).\nFund returns after taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient capital gains\nof the same character from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from the sales of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-73\n\nManagement Investment Adviser. BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui,\nGreg Savage and Paul Whitehead (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr.\nSavage and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012, 2008 and\n2022, respectively. Purchase and Sale of Fund\nShares The Fund is an exchange-traded fund\n(commonly referred to as an \u201c ETF \u201d ).\nIndividual shares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-74\n\nMore Information About the Funds This\nProspectus contains important information\nabout investing in the Funds that are listed\nbelow.

publicly\ntraded securities. Shares of each Fund are\nlisted on a national securities exchange and\ntrade in the secondary market at market prices\nthat change throughout the day. The market\nprice for a share of a Fund may be different\nfrom the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. Each Fund\ninvests in a particular segment of the markets\nfor securities and other instruments (as\napplicable) and is designed to be used as part\nof broader asset allocation strategies.\nAccordingly, an investment in a Fund should\nnot constitute a complete investment program.\nAn investment in a Fund is not a bank deposit,\nand it is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, any\nother government agency, BFA or any of BFA\u2019s\naffiliates. Index Funds A share of a Fund\nrepresents an ownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of securities and other\ninstruments (as applicable) that is intended\nto track the Fund\u2019s Underlying Index. An index\nis a financial calculation, based on a\ngrouping of financial instruments, and is not\nan investment product, while each Fund is an\nactual investment portfolio. The performance\nof a Fund and that of its Underlying Index may\nvary\n\n1\n\nfor a number of reasons, including transaction\ncosts, asset or currency valuations, corporate\nactions, timing variances and differences\nbetween the composition of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nand that of the Underlying Index resulting\nfrom the Fund\u2019s use of representative sampling\nor from legal restrictions (such as\ndiversification requirements) that apply to\nthe Fund but not to its Underlying Index. From\ntime to time, the provider of the Underlying\nIndex ( \u201c Index Provider \u201d ) may make changes\nto the index methodology or other adjustments\nto a Fund\u2019s Underlying Index. Unless otherwise\ndetermined by BFA, any such change will be\nreflected in the calculation of the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s performance on a going-forward basis\nafter the effective date of such change.\nTherefore, the performance of the Underlying\nIndex that is shown for periods prior to the\neffective date of any such change generally\nwill not be recalculated or restated to\nreflect the change. BFA uses a representative\nsampling indexing strategy to manage the\nFunds. \u201c Representative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of the applicable underlying index.\nBecause the Funds use representative sampling,\nthey can be expected to have a larger tracking\nerror than if they used a replication indexing\nstrategy. \u201c Replication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests in\nsubstantially all of the securities in its\nunderlying index in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying index. 2\n\nAdditional Information About the Funds' Risks\nEach Fund is subject to various risks, any of\nwhich may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV,\ntrading price, yield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective. Each Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. You could lose all or part of\nyour investment in a Fund, which could\nunderperform other investments. The table\nbelow identifies the principal and other (non-\nprincipal) risks that apply to each Fund. A\nFund that invests in an Underlying Fund also\nmay be indirectly exposed to these risks\nthrough such investment. A description of each\nrisk is provided after the table.\n                                              \n       iSh\u2026  iSha\u2026  iSh\u2026         iSh\u2026  iSha\u2026  \n       Coh\u2026

 Utility Companies     \u2713                     \n  Risk                                        \n                                              \nAsset Class Risk. The securities and other\nassets in a Fund\u2019s portfolio or its Underlying\nIndex may underperform in comparison to other\nindexes that track, or assets that represent,\nother countries or geographic units,\nindustries, markets, market segments, or asset\nclasses. Various types of securities, other\nassets and indexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and underperformance in\ncomparison to\n\n5\n\nfinancial markets generally. This divergence\nmay be due to a number of factors including,\namong other things, inflation, interest rates,\nproductivity, global demand for local products\nor resources, and regulation and governmental\ncontrols. This may cause a Fund to\nunderperform other investment vehicles that\ninvest in different asset classes. Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk. Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage in creation\nor redemption transactions directly with a\nFund. There are a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants for the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or do not place\ncreation or redemption orders for a Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant places orders,\nFund shares are more likely to trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk may be\nheightened for a Fund that invests in\nsecurities issued by non-U.S. issuers or\ninstruments with lower trading volume. Such\nassets often entail greater settlement and\noperational complexity and higher capital\ncosts for Authorized Participants, which may\nlimit the number of Authorized Participants\nthat engage with the Fund. Close-Out Risk for\nQualified Financial Contracts. Regulations\nadopted by global prudential regulators\nrequire counterparties that are part of U.S.\nor foreign global systemically important\nbanking organizations to include contractual\nrestrictions on close-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified financial\ncontracts. Qualified financial contracts\ninclude agreements relating to swaps, currency\nforwards and other derivatives as well as\nrepurchase agreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions prevent a Fund\nfrom closing out a qualified financial\ncontract during a specified time period if the\ncounterparty is subject to resolution\nproceedings and also prohibit a Fund from\nexercising default rights due to a\nreceivership or similar proceeding of an\naffiliate of the counterparty. These\nrequirements may increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. Concentration Risk. A\nFund may be susceptible to an increased risk\nof loss, including losses due to adverse\nevents that affect the Fund\u2019s investments more\nthan the market as a whole, to the extent that\nthe Fund\u2019s investments are concentrated in the\nsecurities or other assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other geographic units,\nmarkets, industries, project types, or asset\nclasses. A Fund with investment concentration\nmay be more adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets, may\nexperience greater price volatility and may be\nmore susceptible to adverse economic, market,\npolitical or regulatory impacts on those\nassets compared to a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments. Consumer Goods\nand Services Companies Risk. Many consumer\ngoods and services companies ( \u201c consumer\ncompanies \u201d ) rely heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending and may\nbe impacted by social trends, marketing\ncampaigns, demographic shifts and other\nfactors affecting consumer preferences and\ndemand. In addition, damage to a brand or a\nreputation crisis can have a substantial\nadverse impact on consumer companies. Certain\nconsumer companies, such as those providing\nmore discretionary goods or services, may\ndepend more on business cycles, overall\neconomic conditions and consumer confidence.\nMany consumer goods and services are subject\nto government regulation and the related\ncompliance costs, and consumer companies also\nface the risk of product liability claims.\nConsumer companies also may be adversely\naffected by volatility in commodity prices,\nsupply chain disruptions and labor shortages.\nCybersecurity Risk. A Fund and entities that\ninteract with the Fund are susceptible to\noperational, information security and related\ncybersecurity risks, both directly and through\ntheir service providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to, a Fund\u2019s\nadviser, distributor, other service providers\n( e.g ., index and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer agents and\nadministrators), counterparties, market\nmakers, Authorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market operators,\nand governmental authorities. Cybersecurity\nrisks are also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in which a Fund\ninvests, which could result in material\nadverse consequences for such issuers and may\ncause the Fund\u2019s investment in such issuers to\nlose value. Cyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or unintentional events.\nThey include, but are not limited to, gaining\nunauthorized access to systems,\nmisappropriating assets or sensitive\ninformation, corrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational disruption.\nGeopolitical tensions may increase the scale\nand sophistication of deliberate attacks,\nparticularly those from nation-states or from\nentities with nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions\nand impact business operations and may result\nin any of the following: financial losses,\ninterference with a Fund\u2019s ability to\ncalculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to trading,\nsubmission of erroneous trades or erroneous\ncreation or redemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service providers to transact\nbusiness, violations of applicable privacy and\nother laws, regulatory fines, penalties,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other legal and\ncompliance expenses. In addition, cyber\nincidents may render records of Fund assets\nand transactions, shareholder ownership of\nFund shares, and other data integral to a\nFund\u2019s functioning inaccessible, inaccurate or\nincomplete. A Fund may incur substantial costs\nin order to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. Each Fund has established business\ncontinuity plans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent, cyber\nincidents. However, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that prevention and\nremediation efforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go undetected.\nFurthermore, a Fund cannot control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and other third\nparties whose activities affect the Fund. A\nFund and its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk. Investing in dividend-paying stocks\ninvolves the risk that such stocks may fall\nout of favor with investors and underperform\nother types of stocks or the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of dividend-paying stocks will not\ndeclare dividends in the future or will reduce\nor 6 eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends), which may adversely affect a Fund\nwith such holdings. In addition, the value of\ndividend-paying stocks can decline when\ninterest rates rise, as fixed-income\ninvestments become more attractive to\ninvestors. Energy Companies Risk. The energy\nsector tends to be closely tied to the\neconomic cycle and can be significantly\naffected by supply-demand dynamics and\nvolatility in commodity prices. Energy\ncompanies also may be adversely affected by\nexchange rate fluctuations, war or other\nconflicts, sanctions, import/export controls,\ndepletion of resources, technological advances\nand labor relations. This sector generally is\nsubject to substantial government regulation,\nand companies may incur significant costs in\ncomplying with environmental and other laws.\nPolicies that promote energy conservation,\nclean energy or the transition to low carbon\nalternatives also may affect the performance\nof energy companies. Energy companies may\ndepend on a relatively small number of\ncustomers, including governmental entities and\nutilities. The exploration and production of\nenergy sources and the development of energy\ninfrastructure often require significant\ncapital expenditures, and companies may face\nhigh interest costs and difficulty in raising\ncapital. Energy companies also may face\nchallenges from operating in countries with a\nhistory of adverse policies or events, such as\nexpropriation, confiscation of assets,\ncorruption, political instability and social\nunrest. The operations of energy companies may\nbe disrupted by events that target or damage\nenergy infrastructure, including cyber or\nother attacks, accidents and natural\ndisasters. Energy companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. The energy sector may\nexperience significant market volatility. For\nexample, Russia's large-scale invasion of\nUkraine in 2022 led to disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nimposed various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. It is impossible to predict the\neffect of current or future sanctions and\nrestrictions, the extent and duration of the\nconflict, and associated disruptions in the\nenergy sector. The effect of these events or\nany related developments could be significant\nand may have a severe adverse effect on a\nFund's performance. Equity Securities Risk.\nEquity securities are subject to changes in\nvalue due to general market or economic\nconditions, perceptions about the markets in\nwhich issuers participate or a number of\nfactors relating to a specific issuer.\nInvestments in equity securities may be more\nvolatile than investments in other asset\nclasses. Equity securities (both common and\npreferred stock) are subordinated to debt\nsecurities in a company\u2019s capital structure,\nand so equity holders are generally subject to\nmore risks, particularly in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Common stock has the\nlowest priority and the greatest risks,\nincluding with respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments. Financial Companies\nRisk. Financial services companies are subject\nto extensive governmental regulation and\nintervention, which may change frequently and\nmay adversely affect their profitability, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and liquid\nassets they must maintain and their size,\namong other things. Financial services\ncompanies also may be significantly affected\nby, among other things, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, credit rating downgrades,\nadverse public perception and exposure\nconcentration. Increased risk-taking by\nfinancial companies may result in greater\noverall risk in the global financial sector.\nCertain events may cause an unusually high\ndegree of volatility in financial markets and\npose the risk of large losses for financial\nservices companies. Financial companies\nfrequently operate with substantial financial\nleverage and are exposed directly to the\ncredit risk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, which also may be leveraged to\nan unknown degree. Financial companies may\nhave significant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties; as a result, a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother financial companies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk may result in\nsignificant negative impacts to companies with\ndirect exposure to the defaulting counterparty\nas well as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financial sector generally.\nGeographic and Security Risks. Issuers in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio may be located in, or\notherwise connected to, parts of the world\naffected by natural disasters, such as severe\nheat, earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic\neruptions, wildfires, droughts, floods,\nhurricanes and tsunamis. In addition, issuers\nmay be impacted by security concerns with\nrespect to a country or region, such as war\nand other types of conflict, terrorism,\nstrained international relations and\nterritorial disputes. Any of these events may\nadversely affect the issuers, markets and\neconomies to which a Fund is exposed, which\nmay adversely affect the value of the Fund.\nHealthcare Companies Risk. The profitability\nof healthcare companies may be adversely\naffected by the following factors, among\nothers: extensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, a\nlimited number of products, labor shortages,\nsupply chain issues and industry innovation.\nMany new products in the healthcare sector\nentail significant research and development\nand require regulatory approval, all of which\nmay be long and costly, and such efforts\nultimately may be unsuccessful. Many\nhealthcare companies depend heavily on\nobtaining and defending patents, which can be\n7 costly, and may be adversely affected by the\nexpiration of patents. Healthcare companies\nalso are subject to extensive litigation based\non product liability and similar claims.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. A Fund may not\nacquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, a Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nLiquid investments may become illiquid after\npurchase by a Fund, particularly during\nperiods of market turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or instrument that\nis deemed to be liquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long as it is\nheld by a Fund, and any security or instrument\nheld by a Fund may be deemed an illiquid\ninvestment pursuant to a Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent a Fund holds\nilliquid investments, the illiquid investments\nmay reduce the returns of a Fund because a\nFund may be unable to transact at advantageous\ntimes or prices. An investment may be illiquid\ndue to, among other things, the reduced number\nand capacity of traditional market\nparticipants to make a market in securities or\ninstruments or the lack of an active market\nfor such securities or instruments. To the\nextent that a Fund invests in securities or\ninstruments with substantial market and/or\ncredit risk, a Fund will tend to have\nincreased exposure to the risks associated\nwith illiquid investments. Illiquid\ninvestments may be harder to value, especially\nin changing markets. If a Fund is forced to\nsell underlying investments at reduced prices\nor under unfavorable conditions to meet\nredemption requests or for other cash needs, a\nFund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified\nin a rising interest rate environment or other\ncircumstances where redemptions from a Fund\nmay be greater than normal. Other market\nparticipants may be attempting to liquidate\nholdings at the same time as a Fund, causing\nincreased supply of a Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments in the market and contributing to\nilliquid investments risk and downward pricing\npressure. In addition, if a Fund is limited in\nits ability to sell illiquid investments\nduring periods when shareholders are redeeming\ntheir shares, a Fund will need to sell liquid\nsecurities to meet redemption requests and\nilliquid securities will become a larger\nportion of a Fund\u2019s holdings. During periods\nof market volatility, liquidity in the market\nfor a Fund\u2019s shares may be impacted by the\nliquidity in the market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by a Fund,\nwhich could lead to a Fund\u2019s shares trading at\na premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.\nIndex-Related Risk. Each Fund seeks to achieve\na return that corresponds generally to the\nprice and yield performance, before fees and\nexpenses, of its Underlying Index as published\nby the Index Provider. There is no assurance\nthat the Index Provider or its agents will\nconstruct or calculate the Underlying Index\naccurately. While the Index Provider describes\nwhat the Underlying Index is designed to\nachieve, neither the Index Provider nor its\nagents provide any warranty or accept any\nliability regarding the quality, accuracy or\ncompleteness of the Underlying Index or its\nrelated data, and they do not guarantee that\nthe Underlying Index will be in line with the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology. BFA also does\nnot provide any warranty or guarantee against\nthe Index Provider\u2019s or any agent\u2019s errors.\nThe Index Provider may rely on various sources\nof information to assess the criteria of\ncomponents of the Underlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on assumptions\nand estimates. Neither a Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology or sources of information will\nprovide an accurate assessment of included\ncomponents. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of an\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the Index Provider\nmay not identify or correct them promptly or\nat all, particularly for indexes that are less\ncommonly used as benchmarks. In addition,\nthere may be heightened risks associated with\nthe adequacy and reliability of information\nabout emerging markets constituents, as such\nmarkets may have less information available or\nless regulatory oversight. Errors related to\nan Underlying Index may negatively or\npositively impact a Fund and its shareholders.\nFor example, if the Underlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund will have\nexposure to such constituents and will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying Index\u2019s other\nconstituents. Shareholders should understand\nthat any gains from an Index Provider\u2019s errors\nwill be kept by the Fund and its shareholders\nand any losses or costs from such errors will\nbe borne by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnusual market conditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural disasters,\npolitical unrest or war) may impact an Index\nProvider or a third-party data provider and\ncould cause the Index Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to an Underlying Index.\nThis could cause the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom its normal or expected composition. If a\nscheduled rebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that would otherwise be removed\nat the rebalance (due to, for example, changes\nin market capitalization or issuer credit\nratings) may remain, causing the performance\nand constituents of the Underlying Index to\nvary from those expected under normal\nconditions. In addition, to the extent\ncircumstances evolve between periodic index\nreviews and reconstitutions, an Underlying\nIndex may include constituents that do not\nalign with its objective or selection\ncriteria, and the Fund tracking the Underlying\nIndex may be similarly affected. In addition\nto scheduled rebalances, an Index Provider or\nits agents may carry out ad hoc index\nrebalances due to reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market conditions,\ncorporate events, or corrections of errors.\nThe relevant Fund will in turn rebalance its\nportfolio to attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the portfolio and the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund and its\nshareholders will directly bear any\ntransaction costs and market exposure from\nsuch portfolio rebalancing. Therefore, index-\nrelated errors and ad hoc rebalances may\nincrease a Fund\u2019s costs and tracking error.\nIndustrial Companies Risk. Industrial\ncompanies face a number of risks, including\nsupply chain and distribution disruptions,\nbusiness interruptions, third-party vendor\nrisks, cyber attacks, trade disputes, product\nrecalls, liability and environmental damage\nclaims, scarcity of materials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer preferences, and\nvolatility in commodity prices and currencies.\nThe products of industrial companies may face\nobsolescence due to technological developments\nand new product introduction. Furthermore,\nchanges in trade restrictions and tariffs as\nwell as broader geopolitical developments\ncould adversely affect industrial companies.\nThese companies also may be significantly\naffected by domestic and international\neconomic conditions, legislative and\nregulatory changes, and labor relations.\nIndustrial companies may depend on public or\nprivate sector financing, which may become\ndifficult to obtain due to government spending\n8 constraints or reduced availability of\ncapital. Such companies may be unable to\nprotect their intellectual property rights or\nmay be liable for infringing the intellectual\nproperty rights of others. Issuer Risk. The\nperformance of a Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other assets may\ndecline, or perform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of the\nissuer or counterparty. Large-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Large-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-capitalization\ncompanies to adapt to changing market\nconditions and competitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of large-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets. Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders of a\nFund, including an Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares or may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or loan Fund\nshares (to secure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party. There can be no\nassurance that any large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not redeem their\ninvestment or that the size of a Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a large number of\nFund shares may adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the extent a Fund\npermits redemptions in cash, these redemptions\nmay force the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material effect on the\nmarket price of Fund shares, increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or capital\ngains, and cause the Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders earlier than\nthe Fund otherwise would have. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such tax year. A\nFund also may be required to sell its more\nliquid investments to meet a large redemption,\nin which case the Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile, and more\ndifficult to price. To the extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund shares on the\nsecondary market, such transactions may\naccount for a large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may, therefore,\nhave a material upward or downward effect on\nthe market price of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s performance to the extent\nthat the Fund is delayed in investing new cash\nand is required to maintain a larger cash\nposition than it ordinarily would, diluting\nits investment returns. Management Risk. An\nindex Fund invests in securities or other\nassets included in, or representative of, its\nUnderlying Index, regardless of their\ninvestment merits. Such a Fund may be affected\nby a general decline in market segments\nrelated to its Underlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to invest the\nFund\u2019s assets in defensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including declining\nmarkets. Market disruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an adverse effect on a\nFund\u2019s ability to adjust its exposure to the\nrequired levels in order to track its\nUnderlying Index. Because BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy, a\nFund will not fully replicate its Underlying\nIndex and may hold securities or other assets\nnot included in the Underlying Index. As a\nresult, a Fund is subject to the risk that\nBFA\u2019s investment strategy, whose\nimplementation is subject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the intended\nresults. There is no guarantee that a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a high degree of\ncorrelation to those of its Underlying Index\nor that a Fund will achieve its investment\nobjective. Market Risk. A Fund could lose\nmoney over short periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over longer periods\nduring more prolonged market downturns. The\nvalue of a financial instrument or other asset\nmay decline due to changes in general market\nconditions, economic trends or events that are\nnot specifically related to the particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors that affect\none or more issuers, counterparties,\nexchanges, countries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or asset classes.\nLocal, regional or global events such as war,\nacts of terrorism, pandemics or other public\nhealth issues, recessions, the prospect or\noccurrence of a sovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments and could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s NAV. Changes\nin market and economic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all types of\ninstruments and assets. Market Trading Risk. A\nFund faces numerous market trading risks, any\nof which may lead to its shares trading in the\nsecondary market at a premium or discount to\nNAV or to the intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy Fund shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto NAV or sell Fund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a discount to the NAV, you\nmay pay significantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the underlying value\nof the Fund shares. Absence of an Active\nPrimary Market. Although Fund shares are\nlisted for trading on one or more stock\nexchanges, there can be no assurance that an\nactive primary trading market for Fund shares\nwill develop or be maintained by market makers\nor Authorized Participants. Secondary Listing\nRisks. A Fund\u2019s shares may be listed or traded\non U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other\nthan the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing is maintained. Fund shares\nalso may be available to non-U.S. investors\nthrough funds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary receipts. There\ncan be no assurance that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to trade on any such stock exchange\nor in any market or that a Fund\u2019s shares will\ncontinue to meet the requirements for exchange\nlisting or market trading. A Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe less actively traded in certain markets\nthan in others, and investors are subject to\nthe execution and settlement risks and market\nstandards of the market where they or their\nbroker direct their trades for execution.\nCertain information that is available to\ninvestors 9 who trade Fund shares on a U.S.\nstock exchange during regular U.S. market\nhours may not be available to investors who\ntrade in other markets, which may result in\nsecondary market prices in such markets being\nless efficient. Secondary Market Trading Risk.\nShares of a Fund may trade in the secondary\nmarket at times when the Fund does not accept\norders to create or redeem shares. At such\ntimes, shares may trade in the secondary\nmarket with more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might be experienced at\ntimes when the Fund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities held by a Fund\nmay be traded in markets that close at a\ndifferent time than an exchange on which Fund\nshares are traded. Liquidity in those\nsecurities may be reduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during the time\nwhen the exchange is open but after the\napplicable market closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be wider bid/ask\nspreads on the exchange and a greater premium\nor discount to NAV. In stressed market\nconditions, the market for a Fund\u2019s shares may\nbecome less liquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the markets for the\nFund\u2019s portfolio holdings, and an investor may\nbe unable to sell their Fund shares. Secondary\nmarket trading in Fund shares may be halted by\na stock exchange because of market conditions\nor for other reasons. In times of\nextraordinary market volatility, Fund shares\nmay be subject to trading halts pursuant to \u201c\ncircuit breaker \u201d rules of a stock exchange or\nmarket. If there is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an exchange or\nmarket, an investor may be unable to purchase\nor sell Fund shares. In addition, if trading\nin certain securities or financial instruments\nis restricted, this may disrupt a Fund\u2019s\ncreation/redemption process, affect the price\nat which Fund shares trade in the secondary\nmarket, and result in a Fund being unable to\ntrade certain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such circumstances, a Fund may\nbe unable to rebalance its portfolio or\naccurately price its portfolio holdings and\nmay incur substantial trading losses. Shares\nof a Fund, similar to shares of other issuers\nlisted on a stock exchange, may be sold short\nand are therefore subject to the risk of\nincreased volatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short. In addition,\ntrading activity in derivative products based\non a Fund may lead to increased trading volume\nand volatility in the secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares May Trade at\nPrices Other Than NAV . Shares of a Fund trade\non stock exchanges at prices at, above or\nbelow the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV. A Fund\u2019s NAV\nis calculated at the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in the market\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings. The\ntrading price of a Fund\u2019s shares fluctuates\nthroughout trading hours based on both market\nsupply of and demand for Fund shares and the\nunderlying value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the trading\nprices of a Fund\u2019s shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant redemption requests,\nor other unusual market conditions However,\nbecause Fund shares can be created and\nredeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or premiums to a\nFund\u2019s NAV are not likely to be sustained over\nthe long term (unlike shares of many closed-\nend funds, which frequently trade at\nappreciable discounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While the\ncreation/redemption feature is designed to\nmake it more likely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock exchanges at\nprices close to the Fund\u2019s next calculated\nNAV, exchange prices are not expected to\ncorrelate exactly with the Fund\u2019s NAV due to\ntiming reasons, supply and demand imbalances\nand other factors. In addition, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers, Authorized\nParticipants, or other market participants,\nand during periods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading prices for\nshares of a Fund that differ significantly\nfrom its NAV. Authorized Participants may be\nless willing to create or redeem a Fund\u2019s\nshares if there is a lack of an active market\nfor such shares or the Fund\u2019s underlying\ninvestments, which may contribute to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or Selling Fund\nShares. Buying or selling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of costs that\napply to all securities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you will likely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c spread, \u201d which is\nthe difference between what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares (the \u201c bid \u201d\nprice) and the price at which they are willing\nto sell Fund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price). The\nspread varies over time for Fund shares based\non trading volume and market liquidity. It is\ngenerally narrower if a Fund has more trading\nvolume and market liquidity and wider if a\nFund has less trading volume and market\nliquidity. Increased market volatility also\nmay cause wider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other charges that are\nincurred as a result of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in buying or\nselling Fund shares, frequent trading may\ndetract significantly from investment results,\nand an investment in Fund shares may not be\nadvisable for investors who anticipate\nregularly making small investments through a\nbrokerage account. Materials Companies Risk.\nThe materials sector tends to be closely tied\nto the economic cycle and can be significantly\naffected by supply-demand dynamics. Materials\ncompanies may be adversely affected by\ncommodity price volatility, exchange rate\nfluctuations, social and political unrest,\nwar, import and export controls, supply chain\ndisruption, increased competition, depletion\nof resources, technical advances, labor\nrelations, litigation and government\nregulations, among other factors. Materials\ncompanies are at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may incur significant costs in\ncomplying with environmental laws. Mid-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Investments in\nmid-capitalization companies may be riskier,\nless liquid, more volatile and more\nsusceptible to economic, market and industry\nchanges than investments in large-\ncapitalization companies. Mid-capitalization\ncompanies may have more limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources and management\nexperience. As a result, they generally are\nmore vulnerable than large-capitalization\ncompanies to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Mid-capitalization companies may\nhave a shorter business track record, with\nrelatively less information available to\ninvestors. The securities of mid-sized\ncompanies may trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than the securities of larger\ncompanies. 10 Non-Diversification Risk. A Fund\nthat is classified as \u201c non-diversified \u201d may\ninvest a greater percentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments representing a\nsmall number of issuers or counterparties,\ncompared with funds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified. \u201d A non-diversified Fund thus may\nbe more susceptible to the risks associated\nwith these particular issuers or\ncounterparties. The gains and losses on such\nholdings may have a greater impact on a non-\ndiversified Fund\u2019s performance than they would\non the performance of a diversified Fund, and\na non-diversified Fund\u2019s NAV may be more\nvolatile. Operational Risk. Each Fund is\nexposed to operational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited\nto, human error, processing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s service\nproviders, counterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures. Each Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these operational risks\nthrough controls and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address every possible\nrisk and may be inadequate to address\nsignificant operational risks. Real Estate\nCompanies Risk. Real estate companies, which\ninclude real estate investment trusts, real\nestate holding and operating companies, and\nreal estate management or development\ncompanies, expose investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly as well as to the\nrisks from the way that such companies\noperate. Real estate companies and property\nvalues may be adversely affected by\nregulations and other governmental actions,\nincluding tax increases, zoning changes and\nother usage restrictions, environmental\nregulations, regulatory limitations on rent or\neviction, and eminent domain. Certain real\nestate companies, such as REITs, could fail to\nqualify for favorable tax or regulatory\ntreatment. Real estate is highly sensitive to\ngeneral and local economic conditions and can\nbe subject to intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Real estate companies may own a\nlimited number of properties and concentrate\ntheir investments in a particular geographic\nregion, industry or property type. Economic\ndownturns or other adverse events (e.g.,\nnatural disasters) that affect a particular\nregion, industry or property type may lead to\ndecreases in property values, leasing declines\nand defaults by borrowers or tenants. In the\nevent of a default, a real estate company may\nexperience substantial delays and costs in\nenforcing its rights with respect to the\nproperty and protecting its investment. In\naddition, because real estate is relatively\nilliquid, a company may be constrained in its\nability to diversify or liquidate its\ninvestments in response to economic conditions\nor other events. Real estate companies may\ndepend on the management skills of a few key\nindividuals and may have limited financial\nresources. They may be highly leveraged, which\ncan magnify losses, and interest rate\nincreases can make it difficult for them, as\nwell as borrowers and tenants, to obtain debt\nfinancing and meet payment obligations.\nDeclining interest rates could result in\nincreased prepayment on loans and require\nredeployment of capital in less desirable\ninvestments. Certain real estate companies,\nsuch as REITs, could fail to qualify for\nfavorable tax or regulatory treatment, which\ncould produce adverse economic consequences\nfor the company and its investors, including a\nFund. 11 Risk of Investing in the U.S.\nInvesting in U.S. issuers involves legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks that are specific to the U.S. A\ndecrease in imports or exports, changes in\ntrade regulations, inflation, an economic\nrecession, financial system stress, or\npolitical turmoil, among other risks, may have\nan adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the\nsecurities listed on U.S. exchanges. The U.S.\nis also subject to the risk of natural\ndisasters, such as droughts, earthquakes,\nfires and floods. U.S. security risks include\nacts of terrorism, internal unrest and a\ndeterioration in relations between the U.S.\nand certain countries. Any of these may\nadversely affect the U.S. economy, financial\nmarkets or issuers. Governmental agencies\nproject that the U.S. will maintain elevated\npublic debt levels for the foreseeable future.\nAlthough elevated debt levels do not\nnecessarily indicate or cause economic\nproblems, the costs of servicing such debt may\nconstrain future economic growth.\nCircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal on\nU.S. government debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. Securities Lending\nRisk. A Fund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that a\nFund may lose money because the borrower of\nthe loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. A\nFund could also lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund. Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Investments in\nsmall-capitalization companies may be riskier,\nless liquid, more volatile and more\nsusceptible to economic, market and industry\nchanges than investments in large- or mid-\ncapitalization companies. Small-capitalization\ncompanies may have more limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources, personnel and\nmanagement experience. As a result, they\ngenerally are more vulnerable than larger\ncompanies to adverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Small-capitalization companies\nmay have a short business track record, with\nrelatively less information available to\ninvestors. The securities of smaller companies\nmay trade less frequently and in lower volumes\nthan the securities of larger companies. Some\nsecurities of smaller issuers may be illiquid\nor restricted as to resale, and their values\nmay have significant volatility. A Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such\nsecurities at any time, or at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet the Fund\u2019s\nobligations. Technology Companies Risk.\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources and personnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence as well as\nunexpected risks and costs related to new\nproduct introduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies may\nbe adversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs.\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk. If certain\naggregate and/or fund-level ownership\nthresholds are reached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates or a Fund,\nor as a result of third-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or regulator, the ability\nof BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients\n(including a Fund) to purchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or undertake\nbusiness transactions may be restricted by\nregulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity\nof a Fund to invest in certain securities or\nother assets may be affected by the relevant\nthreshold limits, and such limitations may\nhave adverse effects on the liquidity and\nperformance of the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nTo the extent a Fund tracks an index, such\nlimits may increase the risk of the Fund being\nunderinvested in an asset relative to its\nUnderlying Index and increase the risk of\ntracking error. For example, ownership limits\nmay apply to securities whose issuers operate\nin certain regulated industries or in certain\ninternational markets. Such limits also may\napply where the investing entity (such as a\nFund) is subject to corporate or regulatory\nownership restrictions or invests in certain\nfutures or other derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel amounts invested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including a Fund) may not\nexceed the relevant limits without the grant\nof a license or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent. In other cases, exceeding such\nthresholds may cause BFA and its affiliates, a\nFund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions.\nTracking Error Risk. A Fund may be subject to\n\u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the divergence of\na Fund\u2019s performance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error may occur due\nto a number of factors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other assets held\nin a Fund\u2019s portfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences in the\ntiming and methodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets; transaction costs\nand other expenses incurred by a Fund that the\nUnderlying Index does not incur; a Fund\u2019s\nholding of uninvested cash; differences in the\ntiming of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by a Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund shareholders; tax\ngains or losses; the requirements for a Fund\nto maintain pass-through tax treatment;\nportfolio transactions carried out to minimize\nthe 12 distribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of custom\nbaskets; changes to the Underlying Index, such\nas during a rebalancing or reconstitution; and\nimpacts to a Fund of complying with certain\nregulatory requirements or limits. A Fund that\ntracks an index composed of a large number of\nsecurities or other assets may experience\ngreater tracking error than a Fund that tracks\na more narrow index. Tracking error risk may\nbe heightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nTransportation Companies Risk. Transportation\ncompanies may be adversely affected by changes\nin the economy, volatility in energy prices,\nlabor relations, business interruptions,\nsupply chain disruptions, trade disputes,\ntechnology developments, exchange rates,\ninsurance costs and government regulation.\nTransportation companies are also affected by\nnatural disasters, environmental incidents,\nterrorism, war and other events that target or\ndamage transportation infrastructure. As a\nresult of such events, insurance premiums and\nother operating costs may increase\nsignificantly, and insurance coverage may\nbecome unavailable. Securities of\ntransportation companies are generally\ncyclical and may be subject to sharp price\nmovements. Utility Companies Risk. Utility\ninfrastructure often requires significant\ncapital expenditures, and utility companies\nmay face high interest costs and difficulty in\nraising capital. Technological innovations may\nrender existing equipment or products\nobsolete, and companies may experience\ndifficulty in obtaining regulatory approval of\nnew technologies. Utility operations may be\ndisrupted by events that target or damage\nutility infrastructure, including natural\ndisasters and cyber or other attacks.\nUtilities companies may be adversely affected\nby volatility in the price of certain energy\nresources. Utility companies face risks from\ngovernment regulation and oversight as well as\nfrom deregulation (if applicable). Regulators\nmay monitor and control companies\u2019 revenues\nand costs. There is no assurance that\nregulators will grant rate increases or that\nrate levels will be adequate to permit the\npayment of stock dividends or bond coupon\npayments. In addition, there may be regulatory\nrestrictions on the ability of utility\ncompanies to enter new lines of business and\ngeographic areas. Utility companies incur\ncosts in complying with environmental and\nother regulations and may face significant\nchallenges in obtaining regulatory approval\nfor certain projects, such as nuclear power\nplants. Utility companies are at risk of\nliability for environmental harm and other\ntypes of damages. Energy conservation, climate\nchange and other sustainability policies also\nmay impact utility companies. Deregulation may\nsubject companies to greater competition, may\nadversely affect their profitability and may\nlead them to engage in riskier ventures.\nPortfolio Holdings Information A description\nof the policies and procedures with respect to\nthe disclosure of the Funds' portfolio\nsecurities and other assets (as applicable) is\navailable in the applicable Statement of\nAdditional Information ( \u201c SAI \u201d ). Each Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. Fact sheets providing\ninformation about each Fund\u2019s top holdings are\nposted on www.iShares.com when available and\nmay be requested by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737). Management of the Funds\nInvestment Adviser As investment adviser, BFA\nhas overall responsibility for the general\nmanagement and administration of the Funds.\nBFA provides an investment program for the\nFunds and manages the investment of the Funds\u2019\nassets. In seeking to achieve the Funds\u2019\nrespective investment objectives, BFA uses\nteams of portfolio managers, investment\nstrategists and other investment specialists\nand may draw upon the trading, research and\nexpertise of its affiliates. This team\napproach brings together many disciplines and\nleverages BFA\u2019s extensive resources. BFA is an\nindirect wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ) and is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. As of\nJune 30, 2024, BFA and its affiliates provided\ninvestment advisory services for assets of\napproximately $10.6 trillion. From time to\ntime, an employee of BlackRock may express\nviews regarding a particular security or other\ninstrument, asset class, company, industry, or\nmarket sector. Such views are the views of\nonly that individual as of the time expressed.\nThey do not necessarily represent the views of\nBlackRock or any other person within the\nBlackRock organization. Such views may change\nat any time based upon market or other\nconditions, and BlackRock has no\nresponsibility to update such views. You\nshould not rely on any such views as\ninvestment advice or as an indication of\ntrading intent on behalf of a Fund. Fees and\nExpenses Pursuant to the Investment Advisory\nAgreement between BFA and the Trust (entered\ninto on behalf of the Funds), BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\neach Fund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses and any\nextraordinary expenses (as determined by a\nmajority of the Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the Trust). Operating\nexpenses paid by BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude acquired fund fees\nand expenses, if any. A discussion regarding\nthe basis for the approval by the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d ) of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with BFA is\navailable in the Funds\u2019 Form N-CSR filed with\nthe SEC for the period ended October 31 and in\nthe applicable financial statements posted at\nwww.iShares.com. 13\n\nFor its investment advisory services to each\nFund, for the fiscal year ended April 30,\n2024, BFA was paid a management fee from each\nFund, as a percentage of the Fund\u2019s average\ndaily net assets, net of any applicable\nwaivers, at the annual rate set forth in the\ntable below. If BFA has contractually agreed\nto waive a portion of its management fees for\na Fund, the contractual waiver may be\nterminated prior to its expiration date only\nupon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.\nIn addition, BFA may from time to time\nvoluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce a Fund\u2019s total annual fund\noperating expenses (excluding acquired fund\nfees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary\nwaiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by\nBFA at any time.\n                                              \n  Fund                        Management Fee  \n  iShares Cohen & Steers      0.33%1          \n  REIT ETF                                    \n  iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF  0.08%           \n  iShares U.S. Basic          0.39%1          \n  Materials ETF                               \n  iShares U.S. Consumer       0.39%1          \n  Discretionary ETF                           \n  iShares U.S. Consumer       0.40%1          \n  Staples ETF                                 \n  iShares U.S. Energy ETF     0.39%1          \n  iShares U.S. Financial      0.39%1          \n  Services ETF                                \n  iShares U.S. Financials     0.39%1          \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares U.S. Healthcare     0.39%1          \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares U.S. Industrials    0.39%1          \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares U.S. Technology     0.39%1          \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares U.S.                0.39%1          \n  Transportation ETF                          \n  iShares U.S. Utilities ETF  0.39%1          \n                                              \n1 The management fee schedule for the Fund,\nincluding its breakpoint pricing arrangements,\nis described in the Fund\u2019s Statement of\nAdditional Information. Portfolio Managers The\nPortfolio Managers for each Fund are\nresponsible for various functions related to\nportfolio management, including, but not\nlimited to, investing cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of their respective\nportfolio management teams to focus on certain\nasset classes, implementing investment\nstrategy, researching and reviewing investment\nstrategy and overseeing members of their\nrespective teams who have more limited\nresponsibilities.

BFA and its Affiliates are\ninvolved worldwide with a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset management\nactivities and in the ordinary course of\nbusiness may engage in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests of other\nclients may conflict with those of a Fund. BFA\nand its Affiliates act, or may act, as an\ninvestor, research provider, investment\nmanager, commodity pool operator, commodity\ntrading advisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent\nand/or principal. BFA and its Affiliates may\nhave other direct and indirect interests in\nsecurities, currencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other assets in which a Fund\nmay directly or indirectly invest. BFA and its\nAffiliates may engage in proprietary trading\nand advise accounts and other funds that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in and compete for\ntransactions in the same or similar types of\nsecurities, currencies and other assets as are\nheld by a Fund. This may include transactions\nin securities issued by other open-end and\nclosed-end investment companies, including\ninvestment companies that are affiliated with\nthe Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ). The trading\nactivities of BFA and its Affiliates are\ncarried out without reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by a Fund. These\nactivities may result in BFA or an Affiliate\nhaving positions in assets that are senior or\njunior to, or that have interests different\nfrom or adverse to, the assets held by a Fund.\nA Fund may invest in securities issued by, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nwith which an Affiliate has significant debt\nor equity investments or other interests. A\nFund may also invest in issuances (such as\ndebt offerings or structured notes) for which\nan Affiliate is compensated for providing\nadvisory, cash management or other services. A\nFund also may invest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions with, entities\nfor which an Affiliate provides or may provide\nresearch coverage or other analysis. An\nAffiliate may have business relationships\nwith, and receive compensation from,\ndistributors, consultants or others who\nrecommend a Fund or who engage in transactions\nwith or for a Fund. Neither BlackRock nor any\nAffiliate is under any obligation to share any\ninvestment opportunity, idea or strategy with\na Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete\nwith a Fund for appropriate investment\nopportunities. The results of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of other\naccounts managed by an Affiliate. It is\npossible that a Fund could sustain losses\nduring periods in which one or more Affiliates\nand other accounts achieve profits on their\ntrading for proprietary or other accounts. The\nopposite result is also possible. In addition,\na Fund may enter into transactions in which\nBFA or an Affiliate or their directors,\nofficers, employees or clients have an adverse\ninterest. A Fund may be adversely impacted by\nthe effects of transactions undertaken by BFA\nor an Affiliate or their directors, officers,\nemployees or clients. From time to time,\nBlackRock or its advisory clients (including\nother funds and accounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, purchase and\nhold shares of a Fund. The price,\navailability, liquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by BlackRock\nor its advisory clients. A Fund\u2019s activities\nmay be limited because of regulatory\nrestrictions applicable to BFA or an Affiliate\nor their policies designed to comply with such\nrestrictions. Under a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board, the Funds have\nretained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as\ntheir securities lending agent to the extent\nthat they participate in the securities\nlending program. For these services, the\nsecurities lending agent will receive a fee\nfrom the participating Fund based on the\nreturns earned on the Fund\u2019s lending\nactivities, including investment of the cash\nreceived as collateral for the loaned\nsecurities. In addition, one or more\nAffiliates may be among the entities to which\na Fund may lend its portfolio securities under\nthe securities lending program. Under an ETF\nServices Agreement, certain iShares ETFs have\nretained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an Affiliate of\nBFA, to perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock\n\n15\n\ncollaborated with, and received payment from,\nCitibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d ) on the design\nand development of the ETF Services platform.\nCitibank may have, or from time to time may\ndevelop, additional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its\nAffiliates. BlackRock and its Affiliates may\nbenefit from a Fund using a BlackRock index by\ncreating increasing acceptance in the\nmarketplace for such indexes. BlackRock and\nits Affiliates are not obligated to license an\nindex to a Fund, and no Fund is under an\nobligation to use a BlackRock index. The terms\nof a Fund\u2019s index licensing agreement with\nBlackRock or its Affiliates may not be as\nfavorable as the terms offered to other\nlicensees. The activities of BFA and its\nAffiliates and their respective directors,\nofficers or employees may give rise to other\nconflicts of interest that could disadvantage\na Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted\npolicies and procedures designed to address\nthese potential conflicts of interest. Please\nsee the SAI for further information.\nShareholder Information Additional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy and sell\nshares of the Funds, is available free of\ncharge by calling toll-free 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting www.iShares.com.\nBuying and Selling Shares Transactions in\nshares of the Funds occur in the primary\nmarket and the secondary market. Primary\nmarket transactions, known as \u201c creations \u201d\nand \u201c redemptions, \u201d occur only between the\nFunds and Authorized Participants ( i.e .,\nfinancial institutions that are authorized to\nparticipate in such transactions), as\ndescribed in the Creations and Redemptions\nsection below. Fund shares are listed on U.S.\nnational securities exchanges, where they can\nbe bought and sold throughout the trading day\nat market prices, like shares of other\npublicly traded companies. A Fund\u2019s shares may\nalso be available in other secondary markets,\nsuch as on non-U.S. exchanges and through\nfunds or structured investment vehicles\nsimilar to depositary receipts. The Funds do\nnot impose any minimum investment for Fund\nshares purchased on an exchange or otherwise\nin the secondary market. Buying or selling\nFund shares on an exchange or other secondary\nmarket generally involves two types of costs\nthat are common in securities transactions.\nFirst, when buying or selling Fund shares\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. The commission\nis frequently a fixed amount; it may be a\nsignificant proportional cost if you are\nseeking to buy or sell small amounts of\nshares. Second, you may incur the cost of the\n\u201c spread, \u201d which is any difference between\nthe bid price and the ask price for the\nshares. The spread varies over time based on a\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market liquidity.\nGenerally, the spread is smaller if a Fund has\nhigh trading volume and market liquidity, and\nlarger if a Fund has lower trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. The latter is often the case\nfor newly launched or smaller funds. A Fund\u2019s\nspread may also be impacted by the liquidity\n(or lack thereof) of the underlying securities\nor other assets held by the Fund, particularly\nfor newly launched or smaller funds, or by\ninstances of significant volatility of the\nunderlying assets. The U.S. national\nsecurities exchanges that list Fund shares are\nopen for trading Monday through Friday and are\nclosed on weekends and the following holidays\n(or the days on which they are observed): New\nYear\u2019s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents\u2019 Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,\nJuneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.\nInvestments in Investment Companies Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts\ninvestments by investment companies, including\nforeign and unregistered investment companies,\nin the securities of other investment\ncompanies. For example, a registered\ninvestment company (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Funds, may not knowingly sell or\notherwise dispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any investment company\n(the \u201c Acquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company or\ncompanies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if,\nimmediately after such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or\n(ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and other investment\ncompanies and companies controlled by them.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, registered\ninvestment companies are permitted to invest\nin a Fund beyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions set forth in Rule 12d1-4 under the\n1940 Act. To make such an investment in an\nAcquired Fund, a registered investment company\nmust, among other things, enter into an\nagreement with the Trust. If an Acquired Fund\ninvests significantly in other registered\ninvestment companies in reliance on Rule\n12d1-4, an Acquiring Fund will not be\npermitted to rely on Rule 12d1-4 and invest in\nthe Fund beyond the Section 12(d)(1) limits.\nAny investment company interested in\npurchasing shares of a Fund beyond the limits\nset forth in Section 12(d)(1) should contact\nBFA. Foreign investment companies are\npermitted to invest in a Fund only up to the\nlimits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject\nto any applicable SEC no-action relief. Book\nEntry Shares of the Funds are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The Depository Trust\nCompany ( \u201c DTC \u201d ), which serves as the\nsecurities depository for shares of the Funds,\nor its nominee is the record owner of, and\nholds legal title to, all outstanding shares\nof the Funds. 16 Investors owning Fund shares\nare beneficial owners as shown on the records\nof DTC or its participants. DTC participants\ninclude securities brokers and dealers, banks,\ntrust companies, clearing corporations and\nother institutions that directly or indirectly\nmaintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As\na beneficial owner of Fund shares, you are not\nentitled to receive physical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares registered in\nyour name, and you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares. Therefore, to\nexercise any right as an owner of Fund shares,\nyou must rely upon the procedures of DTC and\nits participants. These procedures are the\nsame as those that apply to any other\nsecurities held in book-entry or \u201c street name\n\u201d form. Share Prices The trading prices of a\nFund\u2019s shares in the secondary market\ngenerally differ from the Fund\u2019s daily NAV and\nare affected by various factors, such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF shares and the\nsecurities or other assets held by a Fund as\nwell as other market and economic conditions.\nDetermination of Net Asset Value The NAV of a\nFund normally is determined once daily Monday\nthrough Friday, on each day that the New York\nStock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) is open for\ntrading. The NAV generally is determined as of\nthe close of the NYSE\u2019s regular trading hours,\nnormally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, based on\nprices at the time of closing. Any Fund assets\nor liabilities that are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing\nmarket rates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data service providers.\nThe NAV of a Fund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s net assets ( i.e .,\nthe value of its total assets, including the\nvalue of any underlying fund shares in which\nthe Fund invests, less total liabilities) by\nthe total number of outstanding shares of the\nFund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.\nThe value of a Fund\u2019s assets and liabilities\nis determined pursuant to BFA\u2019s valuation\npolicies and procedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the valuation\ndesignee for each Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5\nunder the Investment Company Act. Equity\nsecurities and other equity instruments for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at market value, which is generally\ndetermined using the last reported official\nclosing price or, if a reported closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on the\nexchange or market on which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at the time of\nvaluation. Shares of underlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds) that are not\ntraded on an exchange are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying ETFs and closed-\nend funds that trade on exchanges are valued\nat their most recent market closing price.\nFixed-income securities are valued using last\navailable bid prices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or prices\n(including evaluated prices) supplied by the\nFunds\u2019 approved independent third-party\npricing services, each in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s valuation policies and procedures.\nPricing services may use matrix pricing or\nvaluation models that utilize certain inputs\nand assumptions to derive values. Pricing\nservices generally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly transactions of an\ninstitutional round lot size, but a Fund may\nhold or transact in such securities in smaller\nodd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower\nprices than institutional round lots. An\namortized cost method of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations with 60 days\nor less remaining to maturity unless BFA\ndetermines in good faith that such method does\nnot represent fair value. Generally, trading\nin certain instruments ( e.g ., non-U.S.\nsecurities, money market instruments, etc.) is\nsubstantially completed each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of the NYSE\u2019s regular\ntrading hours. The values of such instruments\nused in computing a Fund\u2019s NAV are determined\nas of such times. For certain foreign assets,\na third-party vendor supplies evaluated,\nsystematic fair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-factor model\nafter the relevant foreign markets have\nclosed. This systematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to correlate the\nprices of foreign assets in one or more\nnon-U.S. markets following the close of the\nlocal markets to the prices that might have\nprevailed as of a Fund\u2019s pricing time.\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options may\nbe valued using a mathematical model that may\nincorporate a number of market data factors.\nWhen market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in accordance with its policies\nand procedures. Fair value represents a good\nfaith approximation of the value of an asset\nor liability. It is the amount that the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive from the\ncurrent sale of an asset or the cost to\nextinguish a liability in an arm\u2019s-length\ntransaction. BFA may conclude that a market\nquotation is not readily available or is\nunreliable if: \u25a0 An asset or liability does\nnot have a price source due to its lack of\ntrading or other reasons; \u25a0 A market quotation\ndiffers significantly from recent price\nquotations or otherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value; \u25a0 The asset or liability\nis thinly traded; \u25a0 There is a significant\nevent subsequent to the most recent market\nquotation; or \u25a0 The trading market on which an\ninstrument is listed is suspended or closed\nand no appropriate alternative trading market\nis available. 17 A \u201c significant event \u201d is\ndeemed to occur if BFA determines, in its\nreasonable business judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u2019s assets or\nliabilities, that the event is likely to cause\na material change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nof the Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities. Valuing a\nFund\u2019s investments using fair value pricing\nmay result in prices that differ from current\nmarket valuations and that may not be the\nprices at which those investments could have\nbeen sold during the period for which the\nparticular fair values were used. For an index\nFund, the use of both fair value prices and\ncurrent market valuations in a particular NAV\ncalculation could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used by the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying index. This could, in turn, result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of its underlying index.\nDividends and Distributions General Policies.\nA Fund generally declares and pays dividends\nfrom net investment income, if any, at least\nonce a year. Distributions of net realized\nsecurities gains, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid once a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more frequent\nbasis for a Fund. The Trust reserves the right\nto declare special distributions if, in its\nreasonable discretion, such action is\nnecessary or advisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d )\nor to avoid the imposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or realized\ngains. Dividends and other distributions on\nFund shares are distributed on a pro rata\nbasis to beneficial owners of the shares.\nDividend payments and other distributions are\nmade through DTC participants and indirect\nparticipants to beneficial owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from the Funds.\nDividend Reinvestment Service. No dividend\nreinvestment service is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make the DTC book-entry\nDividend Reinvestment Program available to\nbeneficial owners of Fund shares for the\nreinvestment of distributions. Beneficial\nowners should contact their broker to\ndetermine the availability and costs of the\nservice and the details of participation.\nBrokers may require beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and timetables.\nIf the program is used, dividend distributions\nof both income and realized gains will be\nautomatically reinvested in additional whole\nFund shares purchased in the secondary market.\nNote on Tax Information. The following\nsections summarize some of the consequences\nunder current U.S. federal tax law of an\ninvestment in a Fund. This information is not\na substitute for personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and local taxation on\nFund distributions and sales of Fund shares.\nDistributions that are attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal government\nobligations may be exempt from certain state\nand local tax. Consult your personal tax\nadvisor about the potential tax consequences\nof an investment in Fund shares under all\napplicable tax laws. Taxes As with any\ninvestment, you should consider how your\ninvestment in shares of a Fund will be taxed,\nincluding possible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or when you sell Fund\nshares. The tax information in this Prospectus\nis provided as general information, based on\ncurrent law. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund. There is no\nguarantee that shares of a Fund will receive\ncertain regulatory or accounting treatment.\nTaxes on Fund Distributions Shareholders in a\nFund will receive information after the end of\neach calendar year setting forth the amount of\ndividends and long-term capital gains\ndistributed to them by the Fund during the\nprior year, if any. Likewise, the amount of\ntax-exempt income, if any, that a Fund\ndistributes will be reported. Such income must\nbe reported on the shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax return. In general, distributions\nare subject to U.S. federal income tax for the\nyear when they are paid. Certain distributions\npaid in January, however, may be treated as\npaid on December 31 of the prior year. Capital\nGains. Distributions from a Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than qualified\ndividend income or from net tax-exempt income,\nif any), including distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and distributions out\nof a Fund\u2019s net short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as ordinary income.\nDistributions by a Fund of net long-term\ncapital gains, if any, in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses (capital gain dividends)\nare taxable to you as long-term capital gains,\nregardless of how long you have held the\nFund\u2019s shares. Long-term capital gains and\nqualified dividend income are generally\neligible for taxation at preferential rates\nfor non-corporate shareholders. However,\ndifferent preferential rates may apply\ndepending on the type of capital gains, such\nas Fund distributions of certain amounts\nreceived from REITs, if any. Return of\nCapital. If a Fund\u2019s distributions exceed\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits,\nall or a portion of the distributions made in\nthe taxable year may be recharacterized as a\nreturn of capital to shareholders. A return of\ncapital distribution generally will not be\ntaxable but will reduce the shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis and result in a higher capital gain or\nlower capital loss when those shares on which\nthe distribution was received are sold. Once a\nshareholder\u2019s cost basis is reduced to zero,\nfurther distributions will be treated as\ncapital gains, if the shareholder holds shares\nof the Fund as capital assets. Distributions\nin excess of a Fund\u2019s minimum distribution\nrequirements, but not in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be taxable to\nshareholders and will not constitute\nnontaxable returns of capital. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by a Fund that\nqualify as qualified dividend income, if any,\nare taxable to you at long-term capital gain\nrates. Dividends will be qualified dividend\nincome to you if they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income received by a Fund.\n18 Generally, qualified dividend income\nincludes dividend income from stock issued by\ntaxable U.S. corporations and qualified\nnon-U.S. corporations, provided that the Fund\nsatisfies certain holding period requirements\nand has not hedged its position in the stock\nin certain ways. For this purpose, a qualified\nnon-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S.\ncorporation that is eligible for benefits\nunder a comprehensive income tax treaty with\nthe U.S., which includes an exchange of\ninformation program, or if the stock with\nrespect to which the dividend was paid is\nreadily tradable on an established U.S.\nsecurities market. The term excludes a\ncorporation that is a passive foreign\ninvestment company. Dividends received by a\nFund from a RIC, if any, generally are\nqualified dividend income only to the extent\nthat such dividend distributions are made out\nof qualified dividend income received by such\nRIC. Additionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from a REIT, if\nany, and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a Fund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified business income\n\u201d deduction for non-corporate U.S.\nshareholders to the extent that the Fund\u2019s\nincome is derived from ordinary REIT\ndividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.\nFor a dividend to be treated as qualified\ndividend income, the dividend must be received\nwith respect to a share of stock held without\nbeing hedged by the relevant Fund, and with\nrespect to a share of the Fund held without\nbeing hedged by you, for 61 days during the\n121-day period beginning at the date that is\n60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such date. Fund\ndistributions, to the extent attributable to\ndividends from U.S. corporations, will be\neligible for the dividends received deduction\nfor Fund shareholders that are corporations,\nsubject to certain hedging and holding\nrequirements. Substitute dividends received by\na Fund with respect to dividends paid on\nsecurities lent out, if any, will not be\nqualified dividend income. Medicare Tax. A\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is\nimposed on \u201c net investment income, \u201d\nincluding, but not limited to, interest,\ndividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if\nmarried and filing jointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Alternative Minimum Tax. The AMT is a\nseparate U.S. federal tax system that operates\nin parallel to the regular federal income tax\nsystem but eliminates many deductions and\nexclusions. The AMT has different tax rates\nand treats as taxable certain types of income\nthat are nontaxable for regular income tax\npurposes, such as the interest on certain \u201c\nprivate activity \u201d municipal bonds. If a\ntaxpayer\u2019s overall AMT liability is higher\nthan regular income tax liability, then the\ntaxpayer owes the regular income tax liability\nplus the difference between the AMT liability\nand the regular income tax liability. Market\nDiscount Bonds Any market discount recognized\non a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or adjusted issue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount. To the extent that a\nFund does not include the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gains on the Fund\u2019s\ndisposition of such an obligation will be\ntreated as ordinary income rather than capital\ngains to the extent of the accrued market\ndiscount. Derivatives and Other Complex\nInstruments A Fund may invest in derivatives\nand other complex instruments, and such\ninvestments may be subject to special and\ncomplicated rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund\nare treated as ordinary income or capital\ngains, accelerate the recognition of income to\na Fund or defer a Fund\u2019s ability to recognize\nlosses. In addition, these rules may affect\nthe amount, timing or character of income\ndistributed to you by a Fund. You should\nconsult your personal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules. Non-U.S.\nIncome Taxes Dividends, interest and capital\ngains (if any) earned by a Fund with respect\nto securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may\ngive rise to withholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If,\nat the close of a year, more than 50% of a\nFund\u2019s total assets consist of non-U.S. stocks\nor securities (generally, for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ), generally the Fund may \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to you certain non-U.S. income\ntaxes, including withholding taxes, paid by\nthe Fund. This means that you would be\nconsidered to have received as an additional\ndividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes,\nbut you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your U.S.\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not pass through\nnon-U.S. taxes, the Fund will be entitled to\nclaim a deduction for certain foreign taxes\nthat it incurs. Under certain circumstances,\nif a Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes\npaid with respect to a prior year, the value\nof Fund shares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions passed\nthrough to shareholders with respect to the\nFund\u2019s foreign taxes for the current year\ncould be reduced. If, at the close of the\nyear, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets\nconsist of stocks or securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers, including depositary\nreceipts (no matter where traded) of non-U.S.\ncompanies, or, at the close of each quarter,\nmore than 50% of a Fund\u2019s total assets 19\nconsist of shares of an Underlying Fund, the\nFund may \u201c pass-through \u201d to you certain\nnon-U.S. income taxes (including withholding\ntaxes) paid by the Fund or, if its assets meet\nthese requirements, the Underlying Fund. For\npurposes of foreign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of a Fund, foreign capital gains\ntaxes may not produce associated foreign\nsource income, limiting the availability of\nsuch credits for U.S. persons. Non-U.S.\nShareholders If you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S.\nentity (other than a pass-through entity to\nthe extent owned by U.S. persons), a Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term capital\ngains), if any, generally will be subject to a\n30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a\nlower treaty rate applies. However,\nwithholding tax generally will not apply to\nany gain or income realized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder with respect to any distribution\nof long-term capital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of Fund shares. Separately,\na 30% withholding tax may be imposed on Fund\ndistributions (if any) paid to certain foreign\nentities, unless such entities comply, or are\ndeemed compliant, with extensive reporting and\nwithholding requirements designed to inform\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury of\nU.S.-owned foreign investment accounts. Real\nProperty Interests If at least 50% of a Fund's\nassets consist of U.S. real property\ninterests, including certain REITs and U.S.\nreal property holding corporations (as defined\nin the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury\nregulations), special rules may apply to a\nforeign shareholder receiving a Fund\ndistribution. Distributions that are\nattributable to gains from the disposition of\na U.S. real property interest will be taxable\nas ordinary dividends and subject to\nwithholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if\nthe foreign shareholder held no more than 5%\nof the Fund's shares at any time during the\none-year period ending on the date of the\ndistribution. If the foreign shareholder held\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares, the\ndistribution will be treated as income\neffectively connected with a trade or business\nwithin the U.S. As a result, the foreign\nshareholder will be subject to withholding tax\nat a rate of 21% and generally will be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences generally will\napply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the\nsale of shares of a Fund with at least 50% of\nits assets in U.S. real property interests,\nunless (i) the Fund is domestically controlled\n(meaning that more than 50% of the value of\nthe Fund's shares is held directly or\nindirectly by U.S. shareholders) or (ii) the\nforeign shareholder owns no more than 5% of\nthe Fund's shares at any time during the five-\nyear period ending on the date of the sale.\nShareholders that are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities are urged to consult their\nown tax advisor about the potential tax\nconsequences to them of an investment in a\nFund whose assets include U.S. real property\ninterests. Backup Withholding If you are a\nresident or a citizen of the U.S. and you have\nnot provided a taxpayer identification number\nor social security number and made other\nrequired certifications, by law, backup\nwithholding at a 24% rate will apply to Fund\ndistributions and proceeds (if any).\nSecurities Lending If your shares of a Fund\nare loaned out pursuant to a securities\nlending arrangement, you may lose the ability\nto treat Fund dividends that are paid while\nthe shares are held by the borrower as\nqualified dividend income, and you may lose\nthe ability to use non-U.S. tax credits passed\nthrough by the Fund. Fund of Funds If a Fund\ninvests in an Underlying Fund, short-term\ncapital gains earned by the Underlying Fund,\nif any, will be ordinary income when\ndistributed to the Fund and will not be offset\nby the Fund\u2019s capital losses. To the extent\nsuch Fund is expected to invest in an\nUnderlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s realized losses on\nsales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be\nindefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c wash\nsales. \u201d Capital loss carryforwards of the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will not offset net\ncapital gains of the Fund. Taxes on the Sale\nof Exchange-Listed Fund Shares Any capital\ngain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund\nshares is generally treated as a long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares have been\nheld for more than one year. Any capital gain\nor loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares\nthat have been held for one year or less is\ngenerally treated as a short-term capital gain\nor loss. However, any capital loss on a sale\nof Fund shares held for six months or less is\ntreated as a long-term capital loss to the\nextent that capital gain dividends were paid\nwith respect to such shares. Any such capital\ngains, including from sales of Fund shares or\nfrom capital gain dividends, are included in \u201c\nnet investment income \u201d for purposes of the\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax\nmentioned above. Creations and Redemptions\nPrior to being traded in the secondary market,\nFund shares are \u201c created \u201d at NAV by\nAuthorized Participants ( i.e. , market\nmakers, large investors and other financial\ninstitutions) in block-size Creation Units or\nmultiples thereof. Fund shares are created or\nredeemed only in Creation Units, and only\nAuthorized Participants may create or redeem\nCreation Units with the Funds. 20\n\nEach Authorized Participant is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC and has entered into a written\nagreement with the Funds\u2019 Distributor, an\naffiliate of BFA. The agreement allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of Creation Units.\nAuthorized Participants may create or redeem\nCreation Units for their own accounts or for\ncustomers, including, without limitation,\naffiliates of the Funds. Creation transactions\nare subject to acceptance by the Distributor\nand the relevant Fund. Generally, there are\nthree transaction methods for creating and\nredeeming Fund shares: in-kind securities ( \u201c\nin-kind \u201d ), partial cash and all cash. In-\nKind . In a creation transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits into a Fund a\n\u201c creation basket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets designated by the\nFund, as well as a cash amount. The Authorized\nParticipant receives a specified number of\nCreation Units in return. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits Creation Units with a Fund and\nreceives from the Fund a \u201c redemption basket,\n\u201d which is a portfolio of securities or other\nassets designated by the Fund, as well as a\ncash amount. Partial Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund a creation basket and a\ncash amount, including cash that replaces a\nsecurity or other asset in the creation\nbasket, in exchange for Creation Units. In a\nredemption transaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation Units with a\nFund and receives from the Fund a redemption\nbasket and a cash amount, including cash that\nreplaces a security or other asset in the\nredemption basket. All Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund an amount of cash\nspecified by the Fund in exchange for Creation\nUnits. In a redemption transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits Creation Units\nwith a Fund and receives from the Fund a\nspecified amount of cash. The creation and\nredemption baskets for a Fund may differ in\ncomposition, and certain iShares ETFs accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d More information about\ncustom baskets is provided in the Funds\u2019 SAI.\nEach Fund generally engages in creation and\nredemption transactions according to the\nmethod indicated in the table below. In\ncertain circumstances, however, a Fund may use\nanother transaction method ( e.g. , an in-kind\nFund may transact partially or fully in cash).\n                                              \n  Fund        In-Kind  Partial      All Cash  \n                       Cash                   \n  iShares                                     \n  Cohen &     \u2713                               \n  Steers                                      \n  REIT ETF                                    \n  iShares                                     \n  Core U.S.   \u2713                               \n  REIT ETF                                    \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S. Basic  \u2713                               \n  Materials                                   \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Consumer    \u2713                               \n  Discretio\u2026                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Consumer    \u2713                               \n  Staples                                     \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.        \u2713                               \n  Energy ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Financial   \u2713                               \n  Services                                    \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.        \u2713                               \n  Financials                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.        \u2713                               \n  Healthcare                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.        \u2713                               \n  Industria\u2026                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.        \u2713                               \n  Technology                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.        \u2713                               \n  Transport\u2026                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  U.S.        \u2713                               \n  Utilities                                   \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nThe prices at which creations and redemptions\noccur are based on the next calculation of a\nFund\u2019s NAV after a creation or redemption\norder is tendered in an acceptable form under\nthe Authorized Participant agreement. In the\nevent of a system failure or other\ninterruption, including disruptions at market\nmakers or Authorized Participants, creation\nand redemption orders may not be executed\naccording to a Fund\u2019s instructions or may not\nbe executed at all. Additional information\nabout the creation and redemption of Creation\nUnits (including the cut-off times for the\nreceipt of creation and redemption orders) is\nincluded in the Funds\u2019 SAI. The Funds do not\nimpose restrictions on the frequency of\npurchases and redemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with a Fund. The Board determined not\nto adopt policies and procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares because each Fund\ngenerally sells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions that are in-kind\nand/or for cash, with a deadline for placing\ncash-related transactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities. However, the Funds have\ntaken certain measures ( e.g. , imposing\ntransaction fees on purchases and redemptions\nof Creation Units and reserving the right to\nreject purchases of Creation Units under\ncertain circumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of frequent cash\npurchases and redemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased tracking\nerror, disruption of portfolio management,\ndilution to the Funds, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the vast majority\nof trading in Fund shares occurs on the\nsecondary market, which does not involve the\nFunds directly, and such trading is unlikely\nto cause many of the harmful effects of\nfrequent cash purchases or redemptions of Fund\nshares.\n\n21\n\nTo the extent a Fund engages in in-kind\ntransactions, the Fund intends to comply with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws in accepting\nsecurities for deposit and satisfying\nredemptions with redemption securities by,\namong other means, assuring that any\nsecurities accepted for deposit and any\nsecurities used to satisfy redemption requests\nwill be sold in transactions that would be\nexempt from registration under the Securities\nAct of 1933, as amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ).\nFurther, an Authorized Participant that is not\na \u201c qualified institutional buyer, \u201d as such\nterm is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933\nAct, will not be able to receive restricted\nsecurities eligible for resale under Rule\n144A. Because Fund shares may be created and\nissued on an ongoing basis, at any point\nduring the life of a Fund a \u201c distribution, \u201d\nas such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be\noccurring. Broker-dealers and other persons\nare cautioned that some activities on their\npart may, depending on the circumstances,\nresult in their being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters subject to the\nprospectus delivery and liability provisions\nof the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether\none is an underwriter must take into account\nall the relevant facts and circumstances of\neach particular case. Broker-dealers should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are participating in a\ndistribution (as contrasted to ordinary\nsecondary transactions), and thus dealing with\nshares that are part of an \u201c unsold allotment\n\u201d within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of\nthe 1933 Act, would be unable to take\nadvantage of the prospectus delivery exemption\nprovided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act.\nFor delivery of prospectuses to exchange\nmembers, the prospectus delivery mechanism of\nRule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only\nwith respect to transactions on a national\nsecurities exchange. Householding Householding\nis an option available to certain Fund\ninvestors. Householding is a method of\ndelivery, based on the preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a single copy of\ncertain shareholder documents can be delivered\nto investors who share the same address, even\nif their accounts are registered under\ndifferent names. Please contact your broker-\ndealer if you are interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a single copy of\nprospectuses and other shareholder documents,\nor if you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change your\nhouseholding status. Distribution The\nDistributor or its agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the iShares ETFs on an agency basis.\nThe Distributor does not maintain a secondary\nmarket in shares of the Funds. The Distributor\nhas no role in determining the policies of the\nFunds or the securities or other assets (as\napplicable) that are purchased or sold by the\nFunds. The Distributor\u2019s principal address is\n50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. BFA or\nits affiliates make payments to broker-\ndealers, registered investment advisers, banks\nor other intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, data provision services, or\ntheir making shares of iShares ETFs available\nto their customers generally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such payments, which may\nbe significant to the intermediary, are not\nmade by the Funds. Rather, such payments are\nmade by BFA or its affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or indirectly\nin part from fees paid by the iShares ETFs.\nPayments of this type are sometimes referred\nto as revenue-sharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions about which\ninvestment options it recommends or makes\navailable, or the level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the payments or\nother financial incentives the intermediary is\neligible to receive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives that are offered\nor made to an intermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary and its\ncustomers and may cause the intermediary to\nrecommend iShares ETFs over another\ninvestment. More information regarding these\npayments is contained in the applicable SAI.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments that their firm\nmay receive from BFA or its affiliates.\nFinancial Highlights The financial highlights\ntable for each Fund is intended to help you\nunderstand the Fund\u2019s financial performance\nfor the past five fiscal years or, if shorter,\nthe period since the Fund\u2019s inception.

Shares are redeemable only in\nCreation Units by Authorized Participants (as\ndefined in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units-Role of the Authorized\nParticipant section of this SAI) and,\ngenerally, in exchange for portfolio\nsecurities and a Cash Amount (as defined in\nthe Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI). Creation Units typically are a\nspecified number of shares, generally ranging\nfrom 50,000 to 120,000 shares or multiples\nthereof. The Trust reserves the right to\npermit or require that creations and\nredemptions of shares are effected fully or\npartially in cash and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of cash. Shares may be\nissued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities, subject to various conditions,\nincluding a requirement that the Authorized\nParticipant maintain with the Trust collateral\nas set forth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to purchase Deposit\nSecurities. See the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI.\nTransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith creations or redemptions that include a\ncash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin each Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of each Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe applicable Prospectus. Shares of each Fund\nare listed for trading, and trade throughout\nthe day, on the applicable Listing Exchange\nand in other secondary markets. Shares of\ncertain Funds may also be listed on certain\nnon-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance\nthat the requirements of the Listing Exchange\nnecessary to maintain the listing of shares of\nany Fund will continue to be met. The Listing\nExchange may, but is not required to, remove\nthe shares of a Fund from listing if, among\nother things: (i) following the initial\n12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no\nlonger eligible to operate in reliance on Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act; (iii)\nany of the other listing requirements are not\ncontinuously maintained; or (iv) any\n\n1\n\nevent shall occur or condition shall exist\nthat, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of a Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of such Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of a Fund through\na broker, you may incur a brokerage commission\ndetermined by that broker, as well as other\ncharges. The Trust reserves the right to\nadjust the share price of the Funds in the\nfuture to maintain convenient trading ranges\nfor investors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Funds or an investor's\nequity interest in the Funds. Investment\nStrategies and Risks Each Fund seeks to\nachieve its objective by investing primarily\nin securities issued by issuers that compose\nits relevant Underlying Index and in\ninvestments that provide substantially similar\nexposure to securities in the Underlying\nIndex. Each Fund operates as an index fund.\nAdverse performance of a security in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio will ordinarily not result in the\nelimination of the security from the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Each Fund engages in representative\nsampling, which is investing in a sample of\nsecurities selected by BFA to have a\ncollective investment profile similar to that\nof the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities\nselected have aggregate investment\ncharacteristics (based on market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability, earnings valuation and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to those of the\nFund\u2019s Underlying Index. A fund that uses\nrepresentative sampling generally does not\nhold all of the securities that are in its\nunderlying index. Although the Funds do not\nseek leveraged returns, certain instruments\nused by the Funds may have a leveraging effect\nas described below. Borrowing. Each Fund may\nborrow for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The iShares\nEnvironmentally Aware Real Estate ETF, iShares\nGlobal Clean Energy ETF and iShares\nInternational Select Dividend ETF, along with\ncertain other iShares funds, have entered into\na syndicated line of credit with the Bank of\nNew York Mellon ( \u201c BNY \u201d ), which serves as\nadministrative agent for itself and the other\nbanks. The syndicated line of credit may be\nused for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding redemption, settlement of trades and\nrebalancing of portfolio holdings. Interest\nrates related to the syndicated line of credit\nare based on the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ) published by the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York plus a spread.\nPursuant to the terms of the credit agreement,\nif SOFR were to cease being published or\nrepresentative, it would be replaced by a rate\nbased on an alternate benchmark selected by\nBNY. The purchase of securities while\nborrowings are outstanding may have the effect\nof leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of\nleverage increases a Fund\u2019s exposure to risk,\nand borrowed funds are subject to interest\ncosts that will reduce net income. Purchasing\nsecurities while borrowings are outstanding\ncreates special risks, such as the potential\nfor greater volatility in the NAV of Fund\nshares and in the yield on a Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nIn addition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\na Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the amount\navailable (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\na Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank\nor may result in a Fund being subject to\ncovenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire a Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Currency\nTransactions. A currency forward contract is\nan over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) obligation to\npurchase or sell a specific currency at a\nfuture date, which may be any fixed number of\ndays greater than two days from the date on\nwhich the contract is agreed upon by the\nparties, at a price set at the time of the\ncontract. A non-deliverable currency forward\nis an OTC\n\n2\n\ncurrency forward settled in a specified\ncurrency, on a specified date, based on the\ndifference between the agreed-upon exchange\nrate and the market exchange rate. A currency\nfutures contract is a contract that trades on\nan organized futures exchange involving an\nobligation to deliver or acquire a specified\namount of a specific currency, at a specified\nprice and at a specified future time. Currency\nfutures contracts may be settled on a net cash\npayment basis rather than by the sale and\ndelivery of the underlying currency. The Funds\ndo not expect to engage in currency\ntransactions for the purpose of hedging\nagainst declines in the value of the Funds'\nassets that are denominated in a non-U.S.\ncurrency. A Fund may enter into non-U.S.\ncurrency forward and non-U.S. currency futures\ntransactions to facilitate local securities\nsettlements or to protect against currency\nexposure in connection with its distributions\nto shareholders, but may not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes. Foreign\nexchange transactions involve a significant\ndegree of risk and the markets in which\nforeign exchange transactions are effected may\nbe highly volatile, highly specialized and\nhighly technical. Significant changes,\nincluding changes in liquidity and prices, can\noccur in such markets within very short\nperiods of time, often within minutes. Foreign\nexchange trading risks include, but are not\nlimited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty\nrisk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and\npotential interference by foreign governments\nthrough regulation of local exchange markets,\nforeign investment or particular transactions\nin non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the correlation of a\nFund's return with the performance of its\nUnderlying Index and may lower the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. A Fund could experience losses if the\nvalue of its currency forwards, options or\nfutures positions were poorly correlated with\nits other investments or if it could not close\nout its positions because of an illiquid\nmarket or otherwise. In addition, a Fund could\nincur transaction costs, including trading\ncommissions, in connection with certain\nnon-U.S. currency transactions.\nDiversification Status. The following table\nsets forth the diversification status of each\nFund:\n                                              \n  Diversified Funds    Non-Diversified Funds  \n  iShares Global REIT  iShares                \n  ETF                  Environmentally Aware  \n                       Real Estate ETF        \n  iShares                                     \n  International        iShares Global Clean   \n  Developed Real       Energy ETF             \n  Estate ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  International                               \n  Select Dividend ETF                         \n                                              \nA fund classified as \u201c diversified \u201d under the\n1940 Act may not purchase securities of an\nissuer (other than (i) obligations issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities and (ii)\nsecurities of other investment companies) if,\nwith respect to 75% of its total assets, (a)\nmore than 5% of the fund\u2019s total assets would\nbe invested in securities of that issuer or\n(b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of that issuer.\nWith respect to the remaining 25% of its total\nassets, the fund may invest more than 5% of\nits assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act,\na fund cannot change its classification from\ndiversified to non-diversified without\nshareholder approval. A non-diversified fund\nis a fund that is not limited by the 1940 Act\nwith regard to the percentage of its assets\nthat may be invested in the securities of a\nsingle issuer. The securities of a particular\nissuer (or securities of issuers in particular\nindustries) may constitute a significant\npercentage of the underlying index of such a\nfund and, consequently, the fund\u2019s investment\nportfolio. This may adversely affect a fund\u2019s\nperformance or subject the fund\u2019s shares to\ngreater price volatility than that experienced\nby more diversified investment companies. Each\nFund (whether diversified or non-diversified)\nintends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S.\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that each Fund will meet their\ninvestment objectives. Futures, Options on\nFutures and Securities Options. Futures\ncontracts, options on futures and securities\noptions may be used by a Fund to simulate\ninvestment in its Underlying Index, to\nfacilitate trading or to reduce transaction\ncosts. Each Fund may enter into futures\ncontracts and options on futures that are\ntraded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange.\nEach Fund will not use futures, options on\nfutures or securities options for speculative\npurposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and\noptions on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5\nof the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under the\nCommodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA, with\nrespect to certain Funds, has claimed an\nexclusion from the definition\n\n3\n\nof the term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d in\naccordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with\nrespect to such Funds, is not subject to\nregistration or regulation as a commodity pool\noperator under the CEA. See the Regulation\nRegarding Derivatives section of this SAI for\nmore information. Futures contracts provide\nfor the future sale by one party and purchase\nby another party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. Each\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, a Fund will\nbe required to deposit with the broker an\namount of cash or cash equivalents known as \u201c\ninitial margin, \u201d which is similar to a\nperformance bond or good faith deposit on the\ncontract and is returned to the Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, each Fund may elect to close the\nposition by taking an opposite position, which\nwill operate to terminate the Fund\u2019s existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof each Fund. The potential for loss related\nto writing call options is unlimited. The\npotential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. The Funds may purchase and write put and\ncall options on futures contracts that are\ntraded on an exchange as a hedge against\nchanges in value of their portfolio securities\nor in anticipation of the purchase of\nsecurities, and may enter into closing\ntransactions with respect to such options to\nterminate existing positions. There is no\nguarantee that such closing transactions can\nbe effected. Securities options may be used by\na Fund to obtain access to securities in its\nUnderlying Index or to dispose of securities\nin its Underlying Index at favorable prices,\nto invest cash in a securities index that\noffers similar exposure to that provided by\nits Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve\nthe Fund\u2019s objective of tracking its\nUnderlying Index. A call option gives a holder\nthe right to purchase a specific security at a\nspecified price ( \u201c exercise price \u201d ) within\na specified period of time. A put option gives\na holder the right to sell a specific security\nat an exercise price within a specified period\nof time. The initial purchaser of a call\noption pays the \u201c writer \u201d a premium, which is\npaid at the time of purchase and is retained\nby the writer whether or not such option is\nexercised. Each Fund may purchase put options\nto hedge its portfolio against the risk of a\ndecline in the market value of securities held\nand may purchase call options to hedge against\nan increase in the price of securities it is\ncommitted to purchase. Each Fund may write put\nand call options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell\nsecurities options on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nsecurities exchange or in the OTC market\nthrough a transaction with a dealer. Options\non a securities index are typically settled on\na net basis based on the appreciation or\ndepreciation of the index level over the\nstrike price. Options on single name\nsecurities may be cash- or physically-settled,\ndepending upon the market in which they are\ntraded. Options may be structured so as to be\nexercisable only on certain dates or on a\ndaily basis. Options may also be structured to\nhave conditions to exercise ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-\nin Events \u201d ) or conditions that trigger\ntermination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out Events \u201d ).\nLending Portfolio Securities. Each Fund may\nlend portfolio securities to certain borrowers\nthat BFA determines to be creditworthy,\nincluding borrowers affiliated with BFA. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is\nmaintained in an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent market value of the securities loaned.\nNo securities loan shall be made on behalf of\na Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of\nall securities loans of the particular Fund\nexceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's\ntotal\n\n4\n\nassets (including the value of the collateral\nreceived). A Fund may terminate a loan at any\ntime and obtain the return of the securities\nloaned. Each Fund receives, by way of\nsubstitute payment, the value of any interest\nor cash or non-cash distributions paid on the\nloaned securities that it would have otherwise\nreceived if the securities were not on loan.\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized\nby cash, the borrower may be entitled to\nreceive a fee based on the amount of cash\ncollateral. The Funds are compensated by any\npositive difference between the amount earned\non the reinvestment of cash collateral and the\nfee paid to the borrower. In the case of\ncollateral other than cash, a Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of each Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nEach Fund conducts its securities lending\npursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC\npermitting it to lend portfolio securities to\nborrowers affiliated with the Fund and to\nretain an affiliate of the Fund to act as\nsecurities lending agent. To the extent that a\nFund engages in securities lending, BlackRock\nInstitutional Trust Company, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d )\nacts as securities lending agent for the Fund,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC\nadministers the lending program in accordance\nwith guidelines approved by the Trust's Board\nof Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the trustees of\nwhich are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ). JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d ) serves as\ncustodian for the Funds in connection with\ncertain securities lending activities.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk\n(i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If a Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Funds'\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, a Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return a Fund\u2019s securities as agreed, the\nFund\u2019s ability to participate in a corporate\naction event may be impacted, or the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. This latter event\ncould trigger adverse tax consequences for a\nFund. A Fund could lose money if its short-\nterm investment of the collateral declines in\nvalue over the period of the loan. Substitute\npayments received by a Fund representing\ndividends paid on securities loaned out by the\nFund will not be considered qualified dividend\nincome. BTC will take into account the tax\neffects on shareholders caused by this\ndifference in connection with a Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to a Fund (as permitted by\napplicable law). Regulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require certain bank-\nregulated counterparties and certain of their\naffiliates to include in certain financial\ncontracts, including many securities lending\nagreements, terms that delay or restrict the\nrights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to\nterminate such agreements, foreclose upon\ncollateral, exercise other default rights or\nrestrict transfers of credit support in the\nevent that the counterparty and/or its\naffiliates are subject to certain types of\nresolution or insolvency proceedings. It is\npossible that these requirements, as well as\npotential additional government regulation and\nother developments in the market, could\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to\nterminate existing securities lending\nagreements or to realize amounts to be\nreceived under such agreements. Liquidity Risk\nManagement. Rule 22e-4 under the Investment\nCompany Act (the \u201c Liquidity Rule \u201d ) requires\nopen-end funds, including exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) such as the Funds, to\nestablish a liquidity risk management program\n(the \u201c Liquidity Program \u201d ) and enhance\ndisclosures regarding fund liquidity. As\nrequired by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have\nimplemented a Liquidity Program, and the\nBoard, including a majority of the Independent\nTrustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as\nthe administrator of the Liquidity Program.\nUnder the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses,\nmanages, and\n\n5\n\nperiodically reviews each Fund\u2019s liquidity\nrisk and classifies each investment held by a\nFund as a \u201c highly liquid investment, \u201d \u201c\nmoderately liquid investment, \u201d \u201c less liquid\ninvestment \u201d or \u201c illiquid investment. \u201d The\nLiquidity Rule defines \u201c liquidity risk \u201d as\nthe risk that a Fund could not meet requests\nto redeem shares issued by a Fund without\nsignificant dilution of the remaining\ninvestors\u2019 interest in a Fund. The liquidity\nof a Fund's portfolio investments is\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment-specific considerations under\nthe Liquidity Program. There are exclusions\nfrom certain portions of the liquidity risk\nmanagement program requirements for \u201c in-kind\n\u201d ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To\nthe extent that an investment is deemed to be\nan illiquid investment or a less liquid\ninvestment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to\ngreater liquidity risk. Non-U.S. Securities.\nThe Funds may purchase publicly traded common\nstocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the extent a\nFund invests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers,\nthe Fund's investment in such stocks may be in\nthe form of American Depositary Receipts ( \u201c\nADRs \u201d ), Global Depositary Receipts ( \u201c GDRs\n\u201d ) and European Depositary Receipts ( \u201c EDRs\n\u201d ) (collectively, \u201c depositary receipts \u201d ).\nDepositary receipts are receipts, typically\nissued by a bank or trust issuer, which\nevidence ownership of underlying securities\nissued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary\nreceipts may not necessarily be denominated in\nthe same currency as their underlying\nsecurities. ADRs typically are issued by a\nU.S. bank or trust company and evidence\nownership of underlying securities issued by a\nnon-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes\nreferred to as continental depositary\nreceipts, are receipts issued in Europe,\ntypically by foreign banks and trust\ncompanies, that evidence ownership of either\nforeign or domestic underlying securities.\nGDRs are depositary receipts structured like\nglobal debt issues to facilitate trading on an\ninternational basis. Generally, ADRs, issued\nin registered form, are designed for use in\nthe U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued\nin bearer form, are designed for use in\nEuropean securities markets. GDRs are tradable\nboth in the U.S. and in Europe and are\ndesigned for use throughout the world.\nDepositary receipts are generally subject to\nthe same risks as the foreign securities that\nthey evidence or into which they may be\nconverted. In addition to investment risks\nassociated with the underlying issuer,\ndepositary receipts expose a Fund to\nadditional risks associated with the non-\nuniform terms that apply to depositary receipt\nprograms, credit exposure to the depository\nbank and to the sponsors and other parties\nwith whom the depository bank establishes the\nprograms, currency risk and liquidity risk.\nUnsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned\nby the issuer of the underlying common stock,\ngenerally expose investors to greater risks\nthan sponsored programs and do not provide\nholders with many of the shareholder benefits\nthat come from investing in a sponsored\ndepositary receipts. Investing in the\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers involves\nspecial risks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in U.S. issuers.\nThese include differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards;\nthe possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation; adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations;\npolitical instability, which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in non-U.S. countries; and\npotential restrictions on the flow of\ninternational capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be\nsubject to less governmental regulation than\nU.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S.\neconomies may differ favorably or unfavorably\nfrom the U.S. economy in such respects as\ngrowth of gross domestic product ( \u201c GDP \u201d ),\nrate of inflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and balance of\npayment positions. Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives. The CFTC subjects advisers to\nregistered investment companies to regulation\nby the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the\nadviser either (i) invests, directly or\nindirectly, more than a prescribed level of\nits liquidation value in CFTC-regulated\nfutures, options and swaps ( \u201c CFTC\nDerivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to each of the Funds. BFA is not,\ntherefore, subject to registration or\nregulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA with respect to the Funds. The\niShares Environmentally Aware Real Estate ETF,\niShares Global REIT ETF, iShares International\nDeveloped Real Estate ETF and iShares\nInternational Select Dividend ETF (the \u201c No-\nAction Letter Funds \u201d ) may also have\ninvestments in \u201c underlying funds \u201d (and such\nunderlying funds themselves may invest in\nunderlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term\n\u201c underlying fund \u201d for purposes of the no-\naction letter referenced below may include,\nbut is not limited to, certain securitized\nvehicles, mortgage or international real\nestate investment trusts, business development\ncompanies and, investment companies that may\ninvest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of the\nforegoing), and therefore may be viewed by the\nCFTC as commodity pools.\n\n6\n\nBFA may not have transparency into the\nholdings of these underlying funds because\nthey are not advised by BFA. To address this\nissue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff\nissued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012\npermitting the adviser of a fund that invests\nin such underlying funds and that would\notherwise have filed a claim of exclusion\npursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay\nregistration as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nuntil six months from the date on which the\nCFTC issues additional guidance on the\ntreatment of CFTC Derivatives held by\nunderlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-\nAction Letter Funds, has filed a claim with\nthe CFTC for such fund to rely on this no-\naction relief. Accordingly, BFA is not\ncurrently subject to registration or\nregulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA in respect of such fund.\nDerivative contracts, including, without\nlimitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-\ndeliverable forwards, are subject to\nregulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act ( \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under comparable\nregimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.\njurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards\nand certain other derivatives traded in the\nOTC market are subject to variation margin and\ninitial margin requirements. Implementation of\nthe margining and other provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory\ntrading, reporting and documentation of swaps\nand other derivatives have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact the costs to a Fund of\ntrading these instruments and, as a result,\nmay affect returns to investors in a Fund.\nRule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act\npermits a Fund to enter into Derivatives\nTransactions (as defined below) and certain\nother transactions notwithstanding the\nrestrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior\nsecurities \u201d under Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act. Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act, among other things,\nprohibits open-end funds, including the Funds,\nfrom issuing or selling any \u201c senior security,\n\u201d other than borrowing from a bank (subject to\na requirement to maintain 300% \u201c asset\ncoverage \u201d ). Under Rule 18f-4, \u201c Derivatives\nTransactions \u201d include the following: (1) any\nswap, security-based swap (including a\ncontract for differences), futures contract,\nforward contract, option (excluding purchased\noptions), any combination of the foregoing, or\nany similar instrument, under which a Fund is\nor may be required to make any payment or\ndelivery of cash or other assets during the\nlife of the instrument or at maturity or early\ntermination, whether as margin or settlement\npayment or otherwise; (2) any short sale\nborrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions ( e.g. ,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nand borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat\nthese transactions as Derivatives Transactions\nunder Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or\nforward-settling securities ( e.g. , firm and\nstandby commitments, including to-be-announced\n( \u201c TBA \u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and\nnon-standard settlement cycle securities,\nunless the Fund intends to physically settle\nthe transaction and the transaction will\nsettle within 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\nUnless a Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to\nadopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if a Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Repurchase\nAgreements. A repurchase agreement is an\ninstrument under which the purchaser ( i.e. ,\na Fund) acquires a security and the seller\nagrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase\nthe security at a mutually agreed-upon time\nand price, thereby determining the yield\nduring the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by a Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Fund may suffer\ntime delays and incur costs or losses in\nconnection with the disposition of the\ncollateral. In any repurchase transaction, the\ncollateral for a repurchase agreement may\ninclude: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations\nissued by the U.S. government or its agencies\nor instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations\nthat, at the time the repurchase agreement is\n\n7\n\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for a\nFund that utilizes them. Such risks are not\nunique to the Funds, but are inherent in\nrepurchase agreements. The Funds seek to\nminimize such risks, but because of the\ninherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, a Fund\nwould likely retain the status of an unsecured\ncreditor of the counterparty ( i.e. , the\nposition a Fund would normally be in if it\nwere to hold, pursuant to its investment\npolicies, other unsecured debt securities of\nthe defaulting counterparty) with respect to\nthe amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured\ncreditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing\nsome or all of the principal and income\ninvolved in the transaction. Reverse\nRepurchase Agreements. Reverse repurchase\nagreements involve the sale of securities with\nan agreement to repurchase the securities at\nan agreed-upon price, date and interest\npayment and have the characteristics of\nborrowing. Generally, the effect of such\ntransactions is that a Fund can recover all or\nmost of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are advantageous\nonly if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a\nrate of interest on the cash derived from\nthese transactions that is greater than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available, and a Fund intends to use\nthe reverse repurchase technique only when BFA\nbelieves it will be advantageous to the Fund.\nThe use of reverse repurchase agreements may\nexaggerate any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of a Fund\u2019s assets. The use of reverse\nrepurchase agreements is a form of leverage,\nand the proceeds obtained by a Fund through\nreverse repurchase agreements may be invested\nin additional securities. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits a Fund to enter\ninto reverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions ( e.g., recourse and\nnon-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed\nbonds) notwithstanding the limitation on the\nissuance of senior securities in Section 18 of\nthe Investment Company Act, provided that a\nFund either (i) complies with the 300% asset\ncoverage ratio with respect to such\ntransactions and any other borrowings in the\naggregate, or (ii) treats such transactions as\nDerivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4.\n(See \u201c Regulation Regarding Derivatives \u201d\nabove.) Securities of Investment Companies.\nEach Fund may invest in the securities of\nother investment companies (including money\nmarket funds) to the extent permitted by law.\nPursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund\u2019s investment\nin registered investment companies is\ngenerally limited to, subject to certain\nexceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of any one investment company;\n(ii) 5% of a Fund\u2019s total assets with respect\nto any one investment company; and (iii) 10%\nof a Fund\u2019s total assets with respect to\ninvestment companies in the aggregate. Other\ninvestment companies in which a Fund may\ninvest can be expected to incur fees and\nexpenses for operations, such as investment\nadvisory and administration fees, which would\nbe in addition to those incurred by the Fund.\nPursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff,\nfees and expenses of money market funds used\nfor cash collateral received in connection\nwith loans of securities are not treated as\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect\na Fund\u2019s pro rata share of the fees and\nexpenses incurred by investing in other\ninvestment companies (as disclosed in the\nProspectus, as applicable). Short-Term\nInstruments and Temporary Investments. Each\nFund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, on an\nongoing basis to provide liquidity or for\nother reasons. Money market instruments are\ngenerally short-term investments that may\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) shares of\nmoney market funds (including those advised by\nBFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c\nCDs \u201d ), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed-time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nnon-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches)\nand similar institutions; (iv) commercial\npaper rated, at the date of purchase, \u201c\nPrime-1 \u201d by Moody's \u00ae Investors Service,\nInc., \u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch Ratings, Inc., or \u201c A-1\n\u201d by Standard & Poor's \u00ae Global Ratings, a\nsubsidiary of S&P Global, Inc. ( \u201c S&P Global\nRatings \u201d ), or if unrated, of comparable\nquality as determined by BFA; (v) non-\nconvertible corporate debt securities ( e.g. ,\nbonds and debentures) with remaining\nmaturities at the date of purchase of not more\nthan 397 days and that have been determined to\npresent minimal credit risks, in accordance\nwith the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7\nunder the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase\nagreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-\ndenominated obligations of non-U.S. banks\n(including U.S. branches) that, in the\n\n8\n\nopinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to\nobligations of U.S. banks that may be\npurchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments\nmay be purchased on a current or forward-\nsettled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions. Swap Agreements.\nSwap agreements are contracts between parties\nin which one party agrees to make periodic\npayments to the other party based on a pre-\ndetermined underlying investment or notional\namount. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the first party\nbased on the return (or a differential in rate\nof return) earned or realized on the\nunderlying investment or notional amount. Swap\nagreements will usually be performed on a net\nbasis, with a Fund receiving or paying only\nthe net amount of the two payments. The net\namount of the excess, if any, of a Fund\u2019s\nobligations over its entitlements with respect\nto each swap is accrued on a daily basis.\nCertain of the Funds may enter into swap\nagreements, including currency swaps, interest\nrate swaps and index swaps, or for the iShares\nGlobal Clean Energy ETF and iShares\nInternational Select Dividend ETF, total\nreturn swaps (some of which may be referred to\nas contracts for difference or \u201c CFDs \u201d ). The\nuse of swaps is a highly specialized activity\nthat involves investment techniques and risks\ndifferent from those associated with ordinary\nportfolio security transactions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets. Tracking Stocks. A tracking stock is a\nseparate class of common stock whose value is\nlinked to a specific business unit or\noperating division within a larger company and\nis designed to \u201c track \u201d the performance of\nsuch business unit or division. The tracking\nstock may pay dividends to shareholders\nindependent of the parent company. The parent\ncompany, rather than the business unit or\ndivision, generally is the issuer of tracking\nstock. However, holders of the tracking stock\nmay not have the same rights as holders of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock. Future Developments.\nThe Board may, in the future, authorize each\nFund to invest in securities contracts and\ninvestments, other than those listed in this\nSAI and in the applicable Prospectuses,\nprovided they are consistent with each Fund's\ninvestment objective and do not violate any of\nits investment restrictions or policies.\nGeneral Considerations and Risks A discussion\nof some of the principal risks associated with\nan investment in a Fund is contained in the\napplicable Prospectus. An investment in a Fund\nshould be made with an understanding that the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of stocks in\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce a Fund\u2019s return.\nBorrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to\ndo so to satisfy its obligations. Custody\nRisk. Custody risk refers to the risks\ninherent in the process of clearing and\nsettling trades and to the holding of\nsecurities, cash and other assets by local\nbanks, agents and depositories. Low trading\nvolumes and volatile prices in less developed\nmarkets make trades harder to complete and\nsettle, and governments or trade groups may\ncompel local agents to hold securities in\ndesignated depositories that may not be\nsubject to independent evaluation. Local\nagents are held only to the standards of care\nof their local markets, and thus may be\nsubject to limited or no government oversight.\nCommunications between the U.S. and emerging\nmarket countries may be unreliable, increasing\nthe risk of delayed settlements or losses of\nsecurity certificates. In general, the less\ndeveloped a country\u2019s securities market is,\nthe greater the likelihood of custody\nproblems. Practices in relation to the\nsettlement of securities transactions in\nemerging markets involve higher risks than\nthose in developed markets, in part because of\nthe use of brokers and counterparties that are\noften less well capitalized, and custody and\nregistration of assets in some countries may\nbe unreliable. The possibility of fraud,\nnegligence or undue influence being exerted by\nthe issuer or refusal to recognize ownership\nexists in some emerging markets, and, along\nwith other factors, could result in ownership\nregistration being lost. In addition, the laws\nof certain countries may put limits on a\nFund\u2019s ability to recover its assets if a\nforeign bank or depository or issuer of a\nsecurity or an agent of any of the foregoing\ngoes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss\nresulting from such custody problems and may\nhave no successful claim for compensation.\n\n9\n\nDividend-Paying Stock Risk. Investing in\ndividend-paying stocks involves the risk that\nsuch stocks may fall out of favor with\ninvestors and underperform the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of the stocks held by a Fund will not\ndeclare dividends in the future or will reduce\nor eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends) in the future. Illiquid Investments\nRisk. Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that a Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without significantly changing the market\nvalue of the investment. The liquidity of an\ninvestment will be determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment\nspecific considerations as set out in the\nLiquidity Program as required by the Liquidity\nRule. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Infectious Illness\nRisk. A widespread outbreak of an infectious\nillness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may\nadversely affect the economies of many nations\nand the global economy and may impact\nindividual issuers and capital markets in ways\nthat cannot be foreseen. An infectious illness\noutbreak may result in travel restrictions,\nclosed international borders, disruption of\nhealthcare services, prolonged quarantines,\ncancellations, supply chain disruptions,\ntemporary and permanent business closures,\nlower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings\ndowngrades, credit defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and political\nimpacts, as well as general concern and\nuncertainty. An outbreak may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social and economic\nrisks in certain countries or globally. These\nimpacts, which could adversely affect a Fund\nand its investments, could be present for an\nextended period of time. In addition, markets\nmay experience temporary closures, extreme\nvolatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity\nand increased trading costs. Such events may\nadversely affect a Fund and its investments\nand may impact a Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or\nsell securities or other assets. Market or\neconomic disruptions could cause elevated\ntracking error and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to a Fund's NAV. Additionally, a\nFund could be adversely impacted if an\noutbreak impairs the operations of its service\nproviders, including BFA. Governmental and\nquasi-governmental may respond to an outbreak\nand any resulting disruptions with a variety\nof fiscal and monetary policy changes, such as\nchanges in interest rates. A reversal of these\npolicies, or the ineffectiveness of such\npolicies, is likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely affect a\nFund\u2019s investments. Money Market Instruments\nRisk. A Fund may hold money market\ninstruments. The value of money market\ninstruments may be affected by changes in\ninterest rates or in the credit ratings of the\ninvestments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of a Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. It is possible to\nlose money by investing in a money market\nfund. Money market funds other than U.S.\ngovernment money market funds and retail money\nmarket funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV instead of\nusing a stable $1.00 per share price.\nOperational Risk. BFA and a Fund's other\nservice providers may experience disruptions\nor operating errors such as processing errors\nor human errors, inadequate or failed internal\nor external processes, or systems or\ntechnology failures, that could negatively\nimpact the Funds. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from a Fund\u2019s in the setting of\npriorities, the personnel and resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. BFA, through its monitoring and\noversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect a\nFund or to develop processes and controls to\ncompletely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Reference Rate\nReplacement Risk. A Fund may be exposed to\nfinancial instruments that recently\ntransitioned from, or continue to be tied to,\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate ( \u201c LIBOR \u201d\n) to determine payment obligations, financing\nterms, hedging strategies or investment value.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct\nAuthority ( \u201c FCA \u201d ), which regulates LIBOR,\nhas ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In\nApril 2023, however, the FCA announced that\nsome USD LIBOR settings will continue to be\npublished under a synthetic methodology until\nSeptember 30, 2024 for certain legacy\ncontracts. SOFR, which\n\n10\n\nis a broad measure of the cost of borrowing\ncash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities in the repurchase agreement market,\nhas been used increasingly on a voluntary\nbasis in new instruments and transactions.\nUnder U.S. regulations that implement a\nstatutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR,\nbenchmark rates based on SOFR have replaced\nLIBOR in different categories of financial\ncontracts. Neither the effect of the LIBOR\ntransition process nor its ultimate success\ncan yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-\nbased instruments may contemplate a scenario\nwhere LIBOR is no longer available by\nproviding for an alternative rate-setting\nmethodology, there may be significant\nuncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any\nsuch alternative methodologies to replicate\nLIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may have alternative rate-setting\nprovisions and there remains uncertainty\nregarding the willingness and ability of\nissuers to add alternative rate-setting\nprovisions in certain existing instruments.\nParties to contracts, securities, or other\ninstruments using LIBOR may disagree on\ntransition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. A Fund may have\ninstruments linked to other interbank offered\nrates that may also cease to be published in\nthe future. Risk of Derivatives. A derivative\nis a financial contract, the value of which\ndepends on, or is derived from, the value of\nan underlying asset, such as a security, a\ncommodity (such as gold or silver), a currency\nor an index (a measure of value or rates, such\nas the S&P 500 \u00ae or the prime lending rate). A\nFund may invest in futures contracts,\nsecurities options, CFDs (for the iShares\nGlobal Clean Energy ETF and iShares\nInternational Select Dividend ETF) and other\nderivatives. Compared to securities,\nderivatives can be more sensitive to changes\nin interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in\nmarket prices and thus a Fund\u2019s losses may be\ngreater if it invests in derivatives than if\nit invests only in conventional securities.\nDerivatives are also subject to counterparty\nrisk, which is the risk that the other party\nin the transaction will not fulfill its\ncontractual obligations. Derivatives generally\ninvolve the incurrence of leverage. When a\nderivative is used as a hedge against a\nposition that a Fund holds or is committed to\npurchase, any loss generated by the derivative\ngenerally should be substantially offset by\ngains on the hedged investment, and vice\nversa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate\nlosses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains\nand, in some cases, hedging can cause losses\nthat are not offset by gains, and the Fund\nwill recognize losses on both the investment\nand the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to\nimperfect matching between the derivative and\nthe underlying security, and there can be no\nassurance that a Fund's hedging transactions,\nwhich entail additional transaction costs,\nwill be effective. Risk of Equity Securities.\nAn investment in a Fund should be made with an\nunderstanding of the risks inherent in an\ninvestment in equity securities, including the\nrisk that the financial condition of issuers\nmay become impaired or that the general\ncondition of stock markets may deteriorate\n(either of which may cause a decrease in the\nvalue of the portfolio securities and thus in\nthe value of shares of the Fund). Common\nstocks are susceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations and to increases and decreases in\nvalue as market confidence and perceptions of\ntheir issuers change. These investor\nperceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Common stocks may experience extreme\nprice volatility due to actions taken by\nparticular investors or groups of investors\n(for example, retail investors influenced by\nsocial media activity or other media coverage\nor significant \u201c short \u201d positions taken by\ninstitutional investors). Holders of common\nstocks incur more risks than holders of\npreferred stocks and debt obligations because\ncommon stockholders generally have rights to\nreceive payments from stock issuers that are\ninferior to the rights of creditors, or\nholders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (the value of which,\nhowever, is subject to market fluctuations\nprior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stocks have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity date. In addition, issuers may, in\ntimes of distress or at their own discretion,\ndecide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which\nmay also cause their stock price to decline.\nAlthough most of the securities in each\nUnderlying Index are listed on a securities\nexchange, the principal trading market for\nsome of the securities may be in the OTC\nmarket. The existence of a liquid trading\nmarket for certain securities may depend on\nwhether dealers will make a market in such\nsecurities. There can be no assurance that a\nmarket will be made or maintained or that any\nsuch market will be or remain liquid. The\nprice at which securities may be sold and the\nvalue of a Fund\u2019s shares will be adversely\naffected if trading markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities are limited or absent, or\nif bid/ask spreads are wide.\n\n11\n\nRisk of Futures and Options on Futures\nTransactions. There are several risks\naccompanying the utilization of futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts. A\nposition in futures contracts and options on\nfutures contracts may be closed only on the\nexchange on which the contract was made (or a\nlinked exchange). While each Fund plans to\nutilize futures contracts only if an active\nmarket exists for such contracts, there is no\nguarantee that a liquid market will exist for\nthe contract at a specified time. Futures\ncontracts, by definition, project price levels\nin the future and not current levels of\nvaluation; therefore, market circumstances may\nresult in a discrepancy between the price of\nthe future and the movement in a Fund's\nUnderlying Index. In the event of adverse\nprice movements, a Fund would continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if a Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, a Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit their risk exposure to\nlevels comparable to a direct investment in\nthe types of stocks in which they invest.\nUtilization of futures and options on futures\nby a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or\neven negative correlation to its Underlying\nIndex if the index underlying the futures\ncontract differs from the Underlying Index.\nThere is also the risk of loss of margin\ndeposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom a Fund has an open position\nin the futures contract or option. The\npurchase of put or call options will be based\nupon predictions by BFA as to anticipated\ntrends, which predictions could prove to be\nincorrect. Because the futures market\ngenerally imposes less burdensome margin\nrequirements than the securities market, an\nincreased amount of participation by\nspeculators in the futures market could result\nin price fluctuations. Certain financial\nfutures exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation permitted in futures contract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\nlimit establishes the maximum amount by which\nthe price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, each\nFund would be required to make daily cash\npayments of variation margin. Risk of\nInvesting in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. An\ninvestment in any of the Funds involves risks\nsimilar to those of investing in portfolios of\nequity securities traded on non-U.S.\nexchanges. These risks include market\nfluctuations caused by such factors as\neconomic and political developments in those\nforeign countries, changes in interest rates\nand perceived trends in stock prices.\nInvesting in securities issued by issuers\ndomiciled in countries other than the domicile\nof the investor and denominated in currencies\nother than an investor\u2019s local currency\nentails certain considerations and risks not\ntypically encountered by the investor in\nmaking investments in its home country and in\nthat country\u2019s currency. These considerations\ninclude favorable or unfavorable changes in\ninterest rates, currency exchange rates,\nexchange control regulations and the costs\nthat may be incurred in connection with\nconversions between various currencies.\nInvesting in any of these Funds also involves\ncertain risks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in a fund whose\nportfolio contains exclusively securities of\nU.S. issuers. These risks include generally\nless liquid and less efficient securities\nmarkets; generally greater price volatility;\nless publicly available information about\nissuers; the imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; the imposition of restrictions on\nthe expatriation of funds or other assets of\nthe Funds; higher transaction and custody\ncosts; delays and risks attendant in\nsettlement procedures; difficulties in\nenforcing contractual obligations; lower\nliquidity and significantly smaller market\ncapitalization; different accounting and\ndisclosure standards; lower levels of\nregulation of the securities markets; more\nsubstantial government interference with the\neconomy and businesses; higher rates of\ninflation; greater social, economic, and\npolitical uncertainty; the risk of\nnationalization or expropriation of assets;\nand the risk of war.\n\n12\n\nRisk of Swap Agreements. The risk of loss with\nrespect to swaps is generally limited to the\nnet amount of payments that a Fund is\ncontractually obligated to make. Swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nswap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, a Fund\nwill have contractual remedies pursuant to the\nagreements related to the transaction.\nHowever, such remedies may be subject to\nbankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could\naffect such Fund\u2019s rights as a creditor ( e.g.\n, a Fund may not receive the net amount of\npayments that it is contractually entitled to\nreceive). A Fund is required to post and\ncollect variation margin and initial margin\n(comprised of specified liquid securities\nsubject to haircuts) in connection with\ntrading of OTC swaps. These requirements may\nraise the costs for a Fund\u2019s investment in\nswaps. Tracking Error Risk. A Fund may be\nsubject to tracking error, which is the\ndivergence of a Fund\u2019s performance from that\nof the applicable underlying index. Tracking\nerror may occur because of differences between\nthe securities and other instruments held in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio and those included in its\napplicable underlying index, pricing\ndifferences, transaction costs incurred by a\nFund, a Fund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash,\ndifferences in timing of the accrual of or the\nvaluation of dividends or interest received by\na Fund or distributions paid to a Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, the requirements to maintain\npass-through tax treatment, portfolio\ntransactions carried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to shareholders,\nacceptance of custom baskets, changes to the\napplicable underlying index or the costs to a\nFund of complying with various new or existing\nregulatory requirements. This risk may be\nheightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result because a Fund\nincurs fees and expenses, while its applicable\nunderlying index does not. Tracking error may\noccur due to differences between the\nmethodologies used in calculating the value of\nthe applicable Underlying Index and\ndetermining a Fund\u2019s NAV. When an issuer is\nintroduced by an index provider into an index\ntracked by a Fund, BFA may conduct an analysis\non such issuer\u2019s securities to identify and\nscreen for outlier high risk behavior (such as\nrapid or unusual price growth that does not\nappear to be supported by publicly available\ninformation on the business and assets of the\nissuer, unusual or significant short interest\nor lending activity, negative sentiment,\nsuspended trading or incorrect free-float\ncalculations, which could be indicators of\npossible irregularities, miscalculations or\neven fraud). If it identifies such behavior,\nBFA may, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the\nrebalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from a\nFund\u2019s portfolio and, if it does so, such a\nfund will be subject to increased tracking\nerror due to the divergence in the securities\nincluded in its portfolio from its underlying\nindex. The application of the abovementioned\nanalysis and screening to a Fund and its\nUnderlying Index is in the sole discretion of\nBFA and its affiliates (without any\nguarantees). The analysis and screening may\nnot exclude any or all high risk securities\nfrom an Underlying Index or a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\na Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more such\nsecurities declines in value. Risk of\nInvesting in Asia. Investments in securities\nof issuers in certain Asian countries involve\nrisks not typically associated with\ninvestments in securities of issuers in other\nregions. Such heightened risks include, among\nothers, expropriation and/or nationalization\nof assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of\nintellectual property, data and other security\nbreaches (especially of data stored\nelectronically), political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision-making,\narmed conflict and social instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or socio-\neconomic unrest. Certain Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid rates of economic growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, and there\nis no assurance that these rates of economic\ngrowth and industrialization will be\nmaintained. Certain Asian countries have\ndemocracies with relatively short histories,\nwhich may increase the risk of political\ninstability. These countries have faced\npolitical and military unrest, and further\nunrest could present a risk to their local\neconomies and securities markets. Indonesia\nand the Philippines have each experienced\nviolence and terrorism, which has negatively\nimpacted their economies. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect Asian issuers that\nrely on the U.S. for trade. Political,\nreligious, and border disputes persist in\nIndia. India has recently experienced and may\ncontinue to experience civil unrest and\nhostilities with certain of its neighboring\ncountries. Increased political and social\nunrest in these geographic areas could\nadversely affect the performance of\ninvestments in this region.\n\n13\n\nCertain governments in this region administer\nprices on several basic goods, including fuel\nand electricity, within their respective\ncountries. Certain governments may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector in their respective countries\nand may own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in this\nregion, which in turn could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments adversely affecting investments\nin the region. Corruption and the perceived\nlack of a rule of law in dealings with\ninternational companies in certain Asian\ncountries may discourage foreign investment\nand could negatively impact the long-term\ngrowth of certain economies in this region. In\naddition, certain countries in the region are\nexperiencing high unemployment and corruption,\nand have fragile banking sectors. Some\neconomies in this region are dependent on a\nrange of commodities, including oil, natural\ngas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly\naffected by international commodity prices and\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. The market\nfor securities in this region may also be\ndirectly influenced by the flow of\ninternational capital, and by the economic and\nmarket conditions of neighboring countries.\nChina is a key trading partner of many Asian\ncountries and any changes in trading\nrelationships between China and other Asian\ncountries may affect the region as a whole.\nAdverse economic conditions or developments in\nneighboring countries may increase investors'\nperception of the risk of investing in the\nregion as a whole, which may adversely impact\nthe market value of the securities issued by\ncompanies in the region. Risk of Investing in\nAustralasia. The economies of Australasia,\nwhich include Australia and New Zealand, are\ndependent on exports from the agricultural and\nmining sectors. This makes Australasian\neconomies susceptible to fluctuations in the\ncommodity markets. Australasian economies are\nalso increasingly dependent on their growing\nservice and tourism industries. Australia and\nNew Zealand are located in a part of the world\nthat has historically been prone to natural\ndisasters, such as drought and flooding. Any\nsuch event in the future could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the economies of\nAustralia and New Zealand and affect the value\nof securities held by a relevant Fund. The\neconomies of Australia and New Zealand are\ndependent on trading with certain key trading\npartners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic\nevents in the U.S., Asia, or in other key\ntrading countries can have a significant\neconomic effect on the Australasian economies.\nThe economies of Australia and New Zealand are\nheavily dependent on the mining sector.\nPassage of new regulations limiting foreign\nownership of companies in the mining sector or\nimposition of new taxes on profits of mining\ncompanies may dissuade foreign investment, and\nas a result, have a negative impact on\ncompanies to which a Fund has exposure. Risk\nof Investing in Central and South America. The\neconomies of certain Central and South\nAmerican countries have experienced high\ninterest rates, economic volatility,\ninflation, currency devaluations, government\ndefaults, high unemployment rates and\npolitical instability which can adversely\naffect issuers in these countries. In\naddition, commodities (such as oil, gas and\nminerals) represent a significant percentage\nof exports for the regions and many economies\nin these regions are particularly sensitive to\nfluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse\neconomic events in one country may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on other countries\nof these regions. The governments of certain\ncountries in Central and South America may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in such countries, which\ncould have a negative impact on the securities\nin which a Fund invests. Diplomatic\ndevelopments may also adversely affect\ninvestments in certain countries in Central\nand South America. Some countries in Central\nand South America may be affected by public\ncorruption and crime, including organized\ncrime. Certain countries in Central and South\nAmerica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. In addition, certain issuers\nlocated in countries in Central and South\nAmerica in which a Fund invests may be the\nsubject of sanctions (for example, the U.S.\nhas imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan\nindividuals, corporate entities and the\nVenezuelan government) or have dealings with\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its\nreputation if it is identified as an issuer\nthat has dealings with such countries. A Fund\nmay be adversely affected if it invests in\nsuch issuers.\n\n14\n\nRisk of Investing in Developed Countries. Many\ncountries with developed markets have recently\nexperienced significant economic pressures.\nThese countries generally tend to rely on the\nservices sectors ( e.g. , the financial\nservices sector) as the primary source of\neconomic growth and may be susceptible to the\nrisks of individual service sectors. For\nexample, companies in the financial services\nsector are subject to governmental regulation\nand, recently, government intervention, which\nmay adversely affect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and\namount of capital they must maintain.\nDislocations in the financial sector and\nperceived or actual governmental influence\nover certain financial companies may lead to\ncredit rating downgrades and, as a result,\nimpact, among other things, revenue growth for\nsuch companies. If financial companies\nexperience a prolonged decline in revenue\ngrowth, certain developed countries that rely\nheavily on financial companies as an economic\ndriver may experience a correlative slowdown.\nConcerns have emerged with respect to the\neconomic health of certain developed\ncountries. These concerns primarily stem from\nheavy indebtedness of many developed countries\nand their perceived inability to continue to\nservice high debt loads without simultaneously\nimplementing stringent austerity measures.\nSuch concerns have led to tremendous downward\npressure on the economies of these countries.\nAs a result, it is possible that interest\nrates on debt of certain developed countries\nmay rise to levels that make it difficult for\nsuch countries to service such debt. Spending\non health care and retirement pensions in most\ndeveloped countries has risen dramatically.\nMedical innovation, extended life expectancy\nand higher public expectations are likely to\ncontinue the increase in health care and\npension costs. Any increase in health care and\npension costs will likely have a negative\nimpact on the economic growth of many\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries rely on imports of certain key\nitems, such as crude oil, natural gas, and\nother commodities. As a result, an increase in\ndemand for, or price fluctuations of, certain\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Developed market countries\ngenerally are dependent on the economies of\ncertain key trading partners. Changes in any\none economy may cause an adverse impact on\nseveral developed countries. In addition,\nheavy regulation of, among others, labor and\nproduct markets may have an adverse effect on\ncertain issuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value\nof a Fund\u2019s investments. Risk of Investing in\nEmerging Markets. Investments in emerging\nmarket countries may be subject to greater\nrisks than investments in developed countries.\nThese risks include: (i) less social,\npolitical, and economic stability; (ii)\ngreater illiquidity and price volatility due\nto smaller or limited local capital markets\nfor such securities, or low or non-existent\ntrading volumes; (iii) companies, custodians,\nclearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-\ndealers may be subject to less scrutiny and\nregulation by local authorities; (iv) local\ngovernments may decide to seize or confiscate\nsecurities held by foreign investors and/or\nlocal governments may decide to suspend or\nlimit an issuer's ability to make dividend or\ninterest payments; (v) local governments may\nlimit or entirely restrict repatriation of\ninvested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi)\ncapital gains may be subject to local\ntaxation, including on a retroactive basis;\n(vii) issuers facing restrictions on standard\npayments imposed by local governments may\nattempt to make dividend or interest payments\nto foreign investors in the local currency;\n(viii) there may be significant obstacles to\nobtaining information necessary for\ninvestigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and investors may experience\ndifficulty in enforcing legal claims related\nto the securities and/or local judges may\nfavor the interests of the issuer over those\nof foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments\nmay only be permitted to be paid in the local\ncurrency; (x) limited public information\nregarding the issuer may result in greater\ndifficulty in determining market valuations of\nthe securities; and (xi) lack of financial\nreporting on a regular basis, substandard\ndisclosure and differences in accounting\nstandards may make it difficult to ascertain\nthe financial health of an issuer. The Funds\nare not actively managed and do not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. Emerging market securities\nmarkets are typically marked by a high\nconcentration of market capitalization and\ntrading volume in a small number of issuers\nrepresenting a limited number of industries,\nas well as a high concentration of ownership\nof such securities by a limited number of\ninvestors. In addition, brokerage and other\ncosts associated with transactions in emerging\nmarket securities can be higher, sometimes\nsignificantly, than similar costs incurred in\nsecurities markets in developed countries.\nAlthough some emerging markets have become\nmore established and tend to issue securities\nof higher credit quality, the markets for\nsecurities in other emerging market countries\nare in the earliest stages of their\ndevelopment, and these countries issue\nsecurities across the credit spectrum. Even\nthe markets for relatively widely traded\nsecurities in emerging market countries may\nnot be able to absorb, without price\ndisruptions, a significant increase in trading\nvolume or trades of a size customarily\nundertaken by institutional investors in the\nsecurities markets of developed countries. The\nlimited size of many of these securities\nmarkets can cause prices to be erratic for\nreasons apart from factors that affect the\nsoundness and competitiveness of the\nsecurities issuers. For example, prices may be\nunduly influenced by traders who control large\npositions in these markets. Additionally,\nmarket making and arbitrage activities are\ngenerally less extensive in such markets,\nwhich may contribute to increased volatility\nand reduced liquidity of such markets. The\nlimited liquidity of\n\n15\n\nemerging market country securities may also\naffect a Fund's ability to accurately value\nits portfolio securities or to acquire or\ndispose of securities at the price and time it\nwishes to do so or in order to meet redemption\nrequests. Many emerging market countries\nsuffer from uncertainty and corruption in\ntheir legal frameworks. Legislation may be\ndifficult to interpret and laws may be too new\nto provide any precedential value. Laws\nregarding foreign investment and private\nproperty may be weak or non-existent. Sudden\nchanges in governments may result in policies\nwhich are less favorable to investors such as\npolicies designed to expropriate or\nnationalize \u201c sovereign \u201d assets. Certain\nemerging market countries in the past have\nexpropriated large amounts of private\nproperty, in many cases with little or no\ncompensation, and there can be no assurance\nthat such expropriation will not occur in the\nfuture. Investment in the securities markets\nof certain emerging market countries is\nrestricted or controlled to varying degrees.\nThese restrictions may limit a Fund's\ninvestment in certain emerging market\ncountries and may increase the expenses of the\nFund. Certain emerging market countries\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestments by foreign persons or limit\ninvestment by foreign persons to only a\nspecified percentage of an issuer's\noutstanding securities or a specific class of\nsecurities which may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\ncompany available for purchase by nationals.\nMany emerging market countries lack the\nsocial, political, and economic stability\ncharacteristic of the U.S. Political\ninstability among emerging market countries\ncan be common and may be caused by an uneven\ndistribution of wealth, social unrest, labor\nstrikes, civil wars, and religious oppression.\nEconomic instability in emerging market\ncountries may take the form of: (i) high\ninterest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation,\nincluding hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of\nunemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes\nin government economic and tax policies,\nincluding confiscatory taxation; and (v)\nimposition of trade barriers. A Fund's income\nand, in some cases, capital gains from foreign\nsecurities will be subject to applicable\ntaxation in certain of the emerging market\ncountries in which it invests, and treaties\nbetween the U.S. and such countries may not be\navailable in some cases to reduce the\notherwise applicable tax rates. Emerging\nmarkets also have different clearance and\nsettlement procedures, and in certain of these\nemerging markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of securities transactions, making\nit difficult to conduct such transactions. In\nthe past, certain governments in emerging\nmarket countries have become overly reliant on\nthe international capital markets and other\nforms of foreign credit to finance large\npublic spending programs, which in the past\nhave caused huge budget deficits. Often,\ninterest payments have become too overwhelming\nfor a government to meet, representing a large\npercentage of total GDP. These foreign\nobligations have become the subject of\npolitical debate and served as fuel for\npolitical parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\nRisk of Investing in Europe. Investing in\nEuropean countries exposes a Fund to the\neconomic and political risks associated with\nEurope in general and the specific European\ncountries in which it invests. The economies\nand markets of European countries are often\nclosely connected and interdependent, and\nevents in one European country can have an\nadverse impact on other European countries. A\nFund makes investments in securities of\nissuers that are domiciled in, have\nsignificant operations in, or that are listed\non at least one securities exchange within\nmember states of the European Union (the \u201c EU\n\u201d ). A number of countries within the EU are\nalso members of the Economic and Monetary\nUnion (the \u201c eurozone \u201d ) and have adopted the\neuro as their currency. Eurozone membership\nrequires member states to comply with\nrestrictions on inflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates, debt levels and fiscal and\nmonetary controls, each of which may\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe.\nChanges in import or export tariffs, changes\nin governmental or EU regulations on trade,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro and\nother currencies of certain EU countries which\nare not in the eurozone, the default or threat\nof default by an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt, and/or an economic recession\nin an EU member state may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other EU\nmember states and their trading partners.\nAlthough certain European countries are not in\nthe eurozone, many of these countries are\nobliged to meet the criteria for joining the\neurozone.\n\n16\n\nConsequently, these countries must comply with\nmany of the restrictions noted above. The\nEuropean financial markets have experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due to concerns\nabout economic downturns, government debt\nlevels and the possible default of government\ndebt in several European countries, including,\nbut not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus,\nFrance, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal,\nSpain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further\neconomic deterioration, certain countries,\nwithout prior warning, can institute \u201c capital\ncontrols. \u201d Countries may use these controls\nto restrict volatile movements of capital\nentering and exiting their country. Such\ncontrols may negatively affect a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. A default or debt restructuring\nby any European country would adversely impact\nholders of that country\u2019s debt and sellers of\ncredit default swaps linked to that country\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, which may be located in\ncountries other than those listed above. In\naddition, the credit ratings of certain\nEuropean countries were downgraded in the\npast. These events have adversely affected the\nvalue and exchange rate of the euro and may\ncontinue to significantly affect the economies\nof every country in Europe, including\ncountries that do not use the euro and non-EU\nmember states. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central\nbanks and others, including austerity measures\nand reforms, may not produce the desired\nresults, may result in social unrest and may\nlimit future growth and economic recovery or\nhave other unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The impact of these actions, especially if\nthey occur in a disorderly fashion, is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely impact the value\nof a Fund\u2019s investments in the region. The\nUnited Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) left the EU ( \u201c\nBrexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could\nadversely affect European or worldwide\npolitical, regulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute to instability\nin global political institutions, regulatory\nagencies and financial markets. Certain\nEuropean countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect European issuers\nthat rely on the U.S. for trade. The national\npolitics of countries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding for example, secessionist movements.\nThe governments of European countries may be\nsubject to change and such countries may\nexperience social and political unrest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region also could impact financial\nmarkets. The impact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of a Fund's investments. Russian\nInvasion of Ukraine . Russia launched a large-\nscale invasion of Ukraine on February 24,\n2022. The extent and duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and resulting\nfuture market disruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the value of the\nruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible\nto predict, but could be significant.\nDisruptions caused by Russian military action\nor other actions (including cyberattacks and\nespionage) or resulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity, including\npurchasing and financing restrictions,\nboycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser\npreferences, sanctions, import and export\nrestrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian companies or\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nmay impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which a Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Risk of Investing in Japan. Japan\nmay be subject to political, economic, labor\nand other risks. Any of these risks,\nindividually or in the aggregate, can impact\nan investment made in Japan. Currency Risk .\nThe Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at\ntimes and any increase in its value may cause\na decline in exports that could weaken the\nJapanese economy. Japan has, in the past,\nintervened in the currency markets to attempt\nto maintain or reduce the value of the yen.\nJapanese intervention in the currency markets\ncould cause the value of the yen to fluctuate\nsharply and unpredictably and could cause\nlosses to investors. Economic Risk . The\ngrowth of Japan\u2019s economy has recently lagged\nthat of its Asian neighbors and other major\ndeveloped economies. Since 2000, Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth rate has generally remained\nlow relative to other advanced economies, and\nit may remain low in the future. The Japanese\neconomy is heavily dependent on international\ntrade and has been adversely affected by trade\ntariffs, other protectionist measures,\ncompetition from emerging economies and the\neconomic conditions of its trading partners.\nJapan is also heavily dependent on oil\nimports, and higher commodity prices could\ntherefore have a negative impact on the\nJapanese economy.\n\n17\n\nGeographic Risk . Natural disasters, such as\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and\ntsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding\nareas and could negatively affect the Japanese\neconomy, and, in turn, could negatively affect\na Fund. Labor Risk . Japan has an aging\nworkforce and has experienced a significant\npopulation decline in recent years. Japan\u2019s\nlabor market appears to be undergoing\nfundamental structural changes, as a labor\nmarket traditionally accustomed to lifetime\nemployment adjusts to meet the need for\nincreased labor mobility, which may adversely\naffect Japan\u2019s economic competitiveness. Large\nGovernment and Corporate Debt Risk . The\nJapanese economy faces several concerns,\nincluding a financial system with large levels\nof nonperforming loans, over-leveraged\ncorporate balance sheets, extensive cross-\nownership by major corporations, a changing\ncorporate governance structure, and large\ngovernment deficits. These issues may cause a\nslowdown of the Japanese economy. Political\nRisk . Historically, Japan has had\nunpredictable national politics and may\nexperience frequent political turnover. Future\npolitical developments may lead to changes in\npolicy that might adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. In addition, China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan. Japan\u2019s\npolitical relationship with China, however,\nhas been strained. Should political tension\nincrease, it could adversely affect the\nJapanese economy and destabilize the region as\na whole. Risk of Investing in the Middle East.\nMany Middle Eastern countries have little or\nno democratic tradition, and the political and\nlegal systems in such countries may have an\nadverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in\nthe Middle East are highly reliant on income\nfrom the sale of oil and natural gas or trade\nwith countries involved in the sale of oil and\nnatural gas, and their economies are therefore\nvulnerable to changes in the market for oil\nand natural gas and foreign currency values.\nAs global demand for oil and natural gas\nfluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may\nbe significantly impacted. In addition, many\nMiddle Eastern governments have exercised and\ncontinue to exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector. In\ncertain cases, a Middle Eastern country\u2019s\ngovernment may own or control many companies,\nincluding some of the largest companies in the\ncountry. Accordingly, governmental actions in\nthe future could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Middle Eastern\ncountries. This could affect private sector\ncompanies and a Fund, as well as the value of\nsecurities in a Fund's portfolio. Certain\nMiddle Eastern markets are in the earliest\nstages of development. As a result, there may\nbe a high concentration of market\ncapitalization and trading volume in a small\nnumber of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of investors and financial\nintermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern\ncountries typically are fewer in number and\nless capitalized than brokers in the U.S. The\nlegal systems in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries also may have an adverse impact on a\nFund. For example, the potential liability of\na shareholder in a U.S. corporation with\nrespect to acts of the corporation generally\nis limited to the amount of the shareholder\u2019s\ninvestment. However, the notion of limited\nliability is less clear in certain Middle\nEastern countries. A Fund therefore may be\nliable in certain Middle Eastern countries for\nthe acts of a corporation in which it invests\nfor an amount greater than its actual\ninvestment in that corporation. Similarly, the\nrights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers\nmay be more limited than those of shareholders\nof a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain or enforce a legal\njudgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some\nMiddle Eastern countries prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on investments in\ntheir capital markets, particularly their\nequity markets, by foreign entities such as a\nFund. For example, certain countries may\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestment by foreign persons or limit the\namount of investment by foreign persons in a\nparticular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern\ncountries may also limit investment by foreign\npersons to only a specific class of securities\nof an issuer that may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\nissuer available for purchase by nationals of\nthe relevant Middle Eastern country. The\nmanner in which foreign investors may invest\nin companies in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries, as well as limitations on those\ninvestments, may have an adverse impact on the\noperations of a Fund. For example, in certain\nof these countries, a Fund may be required to\ninvest initially through a local broker or\nother entity and then have the shares that\nwere purchased re-registered in the name of a\nFund. Re-registration in some instances may\nnot be possible on a timely basis. This may\nresult in a delay during which a Fund may be\ndenied certain of its rights as an investor,\nincluding rights as to dividends or to be made\naware of certain corporate actions. There also\nmay be instances where a Fund places a\npurchase order but is subsequently informed,\nat the time of re-registration, that the\npermissible allocation of the investment to\nforeign investors has already been filled and,\nconsequently, a Fund may not be able to invest\nin the relevant company.\n\n18\n\nSubstantial limitations may exist in certain\nMiddle Eastern countries with respect to a\nFund\u2019s ability to repatriate investment income\nor capital gains. A Fund could be adversely\naffected by delays in, or a refusal to grant,\nany required governmental approval for\nrepatriation of capital, as well as by the\napplication to a Fund of any restrictions on\ninvestment. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nmay be heavily dependent upon international\ntrade and, consequently, have been and may\ncontinue to be negatively affected by trade\nbarriers, exchange controls, managed\nadjustments in relative currency values and\nother protectionist measures imposed or\nnegotiated by the countries with which they\ntrade. These countries also have been and may\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by economic\nconditions in the countries with which they\ntrade. In addition, certain issuers located in\nMiddle Eastern countries in which a Fund\ninvests may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer which operates in, or\nhas dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as\nan investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. Certain\nMiddle Eastern countries have strained\nrelations with other Middle Eastern countries\ndue to territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, international alliances, defense\nconcerns or other reasons, which may adversely\naffect the economies of these Middle Eastern\ncountries. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nexperience significant unemployment, as well\nas widespread underemployment. There has also\nbeen a recent increase in recruitment efforts\nand an aggressive push for territorial control\nby terrorist groups in the region, which has\nled to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities.\nWarfare in Syria has spread to surrounding\nareas, including many portions of Iraq and\nTurkey. Such hostilities may continue into the\nfuture or may escalate at any time due to\nethnic, racial, political, religious or\nideological tensions between groups in the\nregion or foreign intervention or lack of\nintervention, among other factors. Risk of\nInvesting in North America. A decrease in\nimports or exports, changes in trade\nregulations or an economic recession in any\nNorth American country can have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire North American\nregion and on some or all of the North\nAmerican countries in which the Fund invests.\nThe U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest\ntrading and investment partner. The Canadian\nand Mexican economies are significantly\naffected by developments in the U.S. economy.\nSince the implementation of the North American\nFree Trade Agreement ( \u201c NAFTA \u201d ) in 1994\namong Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total\nmerchandise trade among the three countries\nhas increased. However, political developments\nincluding the implementation of tariffs by the\nU.S., and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the\nform of the United States-Mexico-Canada\nAgreement ( \u201c USMCA \u201d ), which replaced NAFTA\non July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North\nAmerica\u2019s economic outlook and, as a result,\nthe value of securities held by a Fund. Policy\nand legislative changes in one country may\nhave a significant effect on North American\nmarkets generally, as well as on the value of\ncertain securities held by a Fund. Risk of\nInvesting in Saudi Arabia. The ability of\nforeign investors (such as the Funds) to\ninvest in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers is relatively new. Such ability could\nbe restricted by the Saudi Arabian government\nat any time, and unforeseen risks could\nmaterialize with respect to foreign ownership\nin such securities. In addition, the Capital\nMarket Authority ( \u201c CMA \u201d ) places investment\nlimitations on the ownership of the securities\nof Saudi Arabian issuers by foreign investors,\nincluding a limitation on the Fund\u2019s ownership\nof the securities of any single issuer listed\non the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may\nprevent the Fund from investing in accordance\nwith its strategy and contribute to tracking\nerror against the Underlying Index. These\nrestrictions may be changed or new\nrestrictions, such as licensing requirements,\nspecial approvals or additional foreign taxes,\nmay be instituted at any time. The Fund may\nnot be able to obtain or maintain any such\nlicenses or approvals and may not be able to\nbuy and sell securities at full value. Major\ndisruptions or regulatory changes could occur\nin the Saudi Arabian market, any of which\ncould negatively impact the Fund. These risks\nmay be exacerbated, compared to more developed\nmarkets, given the limited history of foreign\ninvestment in the Saudi Arabian market.\nInvestments in Saudi Arabia may also be\nsubject to loss due to expropriation or\nnationalization of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on additional\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital. Such heightened risks may include,\namong others, restrictions on and government\nintervention in international trade,\nconfiscatory taxation, political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision making,\narmed conflict, crime and instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has\nprivatized, or has begun the process of\nprivatizing, certain entities and industries.\nNewly privatized companies may face strong\ncompetition from government-sponsored\ncompetitors that have not been privatized. In\nsome instances, investors in newly privatized\nentities have suffered losses due to the\ninability of the newly privatized entities to\nadjust quickly to a competitive environment or\nchanging regulatory and legal standards or, in\nsome cases, due to re-nationalization of such\nprivatized entities. There is no assurance\nthat similar\n\n19\n\nlosses will not recur. Further, under income\ntax laws imposed by the General Authority of\nZakat and Tax, dividends paid by a Saudi\nArabian company to foreign stockholders are\ngenerally subject to a 5% withholding tax\n(different tax rates may apply pursuant to an\napplicable treaty). Saudi Arabia is highly\nreliant on income from the sale of petroleum\nand trade with other countries involved in the\nsale of petroleum, and its economy is\ntherefore vulnerable to changes in foreign\ncurrency values and the market for petroleum,\nas well as acts targeting petroleum production\nor processing facilities in Saudi Arabia. As\nglobal demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi\nArabia may be significantly impacted. In the\nrecent past, the Saudi Arabian government has\nexplored privatization and diversification of\nthe economy in the wake of a diminished\npetroleum market. Like most Middle Eastern\ngovernments, the government of Saudi Arabia\nexercises substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector. Although\nliberalization in the wider economy is\nunderway, in many areas it has lagged\nsignificantly: restrictions on foreign\nownership persist, and the government has an\nownership stake in many key industries. The\nsituation is exacerbated by the fact that\nSaudi Arabia is governed by an absolute\nmonarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Incidents involving a Middle Eastern\ncountry\u2019s or the region\u2019s security, including\nterrorism, may cause uncertainty in their\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. Governmental\nactions in the future could have a significant\neffect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia,\nwhich could affect private sector companies\nand the Fund, as well as the value of\nsecurities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio. Any\neconomic sanctions on Saudi Arabian\nindividuals or Saudi Arabian corporate\nentities, or even the threat of sanctions, may\nresult in the decline of the value and\nliquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a\nweakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse\nconsequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. Any\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Saudi Arabian securities and/or\nfunds investing in prohibited assets,\nimpairing the ability of the Fund to buy,\nsell, receive or deliver those securities\nand/or assets. In addition, Saudi Arabia\u2019s\neconomy relies heavily on cheap, foreign\nlabor, and changes in the availability of this\nlabor supply could have an adverse effect on\nthe economy. The securities markets in Saudi\nArabia may not be as developed as those in\nother countries. As a result, securities\nmarkets in Saudi Arabia are subject to greater\nrisks associated with market volatility, lower\nmarket capitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations, uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets, governmental\ncontrol and heavy regulation of labor and\nindustry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian\ncompanies tend to trade less frequently than\nthose of companies on exchanges in more\ndeveloped markets. Such infrequent trading may\nadversely affect the pricing of these\nsecurities and the Fund\u2019s ability to sell\nthese securities in the future. Although the\npolitical situation in Saudi Arabia is largely\nstable, Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced political instability, and there\nremains the possibility that the stability\nwill not hold in the future or that\ninstability in the larger Middle East region\ncould adversely impact the economy of Saudi\nArabia. Instability may be caused by military\ndevelopments, government interventions in the\nmarketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes,\nattempted social or political reforms,\nreligious differences, or other factors.\nAdditionally, anti-Western views held by\ncertain groups in the Middle East may\ninfluence government policies regarding\nforeign investment. Further developments in\nU.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other\nMiddle-Eastern countries may affect these\nattitudes and policies. The U.S. is a\nsignificant trading partner of, or foreign\ninvestor in, Saudi Arabia. As a result,\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be\nparticularly affected by changes in the U.S.\neconomy. A decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, new trade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar\nexchange rate or an economic slowdown in the\nU.S. may have a material adverse effect on the\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a\nresult, securities to which the Fund has\nexposure. Political instability in North\nAfrica and the larger Middle East region has\ncaused significant disruptions to many\nindustries. Continued political and social\nunrest in these areas may negatively affect\nthe value of securities in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Certain issuers located in Saudi\nArabia may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain\ndamage to its reputation if it is identified\nas an issuer which operates in, or has\ndealings with, such countries. The Fund, as an\ninvestor in such issuers, will be indirectly\nsubject to those risks. U.S. Economic Trading\nPartners Risk. The U.S. is a significant, and\nin some cases the most significant, trading\npartner of, or foreign investor in, certain\ncountries in which a Fund invests. As a\nresult, economic conditions of such countries\nmay be particularly affected by changes in the\nU.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, new trade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar\nexchange rate or an economic slowdown in the\nU.S. may have a material\n\n20\n\nadverse effect on a country\u2019s economic\nconditions and, as a result, securities to\nwhich a Fund has exposure. Circumstances could\narise that could prevent the timely payment of\ninterest or principal on U.S. government debt,\nsuch as reaching the legislative \u201c debt\nceiling. \u201d Such non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences for the U.S.\neconomy and the global financial system. There\nare strained relations between the U.S. and a\nnumber of foreign countries. If these\nrelations were to worsen, it could adversely\naffect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S.\nissuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The\nU.S. has also experienced increased internal\nunrest and discord. If this trend were to\ncontinue, it may have an adverse impact on the\nU.S. economy and many of the issuers in which\na Fund invests. Risk of Investing in the Basic\nMaterials Industry. Issuers in the basic\nmaterials industry could be adversely affected\nby commodity price volatility, inflation,\nexchange rate fluctuations, social and\npolitical unrest, import controls and\nincreased competition. Companies in the basic\nmaterials industry may be subject to swift\nfluctuations in supply and demand.\nFluctuations may be caused by events relating\nto political and economic developments, the\nenvironmental impact of basic materials\noperations, and the success of exploration\nprojects. Production of industrial materials\noften exceeds demand as a result of over-\nbuilding or economic downturns, leading to\npoor investment returns. Issuers in the basic\nmaterials industry are at risk for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may be adversely affected by\ndepletion of resources, delays in technical\nprogress, labor relations, tax and government\nregulations related to changes to, among other\nthings, energy and environmental policies.\nRisk of Investing in the Clean Energy Sub-\nIndustry. Many clean energy companies are\ninvolved in the development and\ncommercialization of new technologies, which\nmay be subject to delays resulting from budget\nconstraints and technological difficulties.\nClean energy companies may be highly dependent\nupon government subsidies and contracts with\ngovernment entities, and may be negatively\naffected if such subsidies or contracts are\nunavailable. Clean energy companies may depend\non the successful development of new and\nproprietary technologies. There can be no\nassurance that the development of new\ntechnologies will be successful or that\nintellectual property rights will be obtained\nwith respect to new technologies. The loss or\nimpairment of intellectual property rights may\nadversely affect the profitability of clean\nenergy companies. In addition, seasonal\nweather conditions, fluctuations in supply of,\nand demand for, clean energy products, changes\nin energy prices, international political\nevents, the success of project development and\nchange in government regulatory policies may\ncause fluctuations in the performance of clean\nenergy companies and the prices of their\nsecurities. Risk of Investing in the\nCommunication Services Sector. The\ncommunication services sector consists of both\ncompanies in the telecommunication services\nindustry as well as those in the media and\nentertainment industry. Examples of companies\nin the telecommunication services industry\ngroup include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-\nline, cellular and wireless telecommunications\nnetworks. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industry group encompass a\nvariety of services and products including\ntelevision broadcasting, gaming products,\nsocial media, networking platforms, online\nclassifieds, online review websites, and\nInternet search engines. Companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be affected\nby industry competition, substantial capital\nrequirements, government regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications products and\nservices due to technological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and international demand,\nshifting demographics and often unpredictable\nchanges in consumer tastes can drastically\naffect a communication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\n\n21\n\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Risk of Investing in the Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector. Companies engaged in the\ndesign, production or distribution of products\nor services for the consumer discretionary\nsector (including, without limitation,\ntelevision and radio broadcasting,\nmanufacturing, publishing, recording and\nmusical instruments, motion pictures,\nphotography, amusement and theme parks, gaming\ncasinos, sporting goods and sports arenas,\ncamping and recreational equipment, toys and\ngames, apparel, travel-related services,\nautomobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food\nand other restaurants) are subject to the risk\nthat their products or services may become\nobsolete quickly. The success of these\ncompanies can depend heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending. During\nperiods of an expanding economy, the consumer\ndiscretionary sector may outperform the\nconsumer staples sector, but may underperform\nwhen economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the\nconsumer discretionary sector can be\nsignificantly affected by several factors,\nincluding, without limitation, the performance\nof domestic and international economies,\nexchange rates, changing consumer preferences,\ndemographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical\nrevenue generation, consumer confidence,\ncommodity price volatility, labor relations,\ninterest rates, import and export controls,\nintense competition, technological\ndevelopments and government regulation. Risk\nof Investing in the Consumer Goods Industry.\nCompanies in the consumer goods industry\ninclude companies involved in the design,\nproduction or distribution of goods for\nconsumers, including food, household, home,\npersonal and office products, clothing and\ntextiles. The success of the consumer goods\nindustry is tied closely to the performance of\nthe domestic and international economy,\ninterest rates, exchange rates, competition,\nconsumer confidence and consumer disposable\nincome. The consumer goods industry may be\naffected by trends, marketing campaigns and\nother factors affecting consumer demand.\nGovernmental regulation affecting the use of\nvarious food additives may affect the\nprofitability of certain companies in the\nconsumer goods industry. In addition, tobacco\ncompanies may be adversely affected by new\nlaws, regulations and litigation. Many\nconsumer goods may be marketed globally, and\nconsumer goods companies may be affected by\nthe demand and market conditions in other\ncountries and regions. Companies in the\nconsumer goods industry may be subject to\nsevere competition, which may also have an\nadverse impact on their profitability. Changes\nin demographics and consumer preferences may\naffect the success of consumer products. Risk\nof Investing in the Consumer Services\nIndustry. The success of firms in the consumer\nservices industry and certain retailers\n(including food and beverage, general\nretailers, media, and travel and leisure) is\ntied closely to the performance of the\ndomestic and international economy, interest\nrates, exchange rates, competition and\nconsumer confidence. The consumer services\nindustry depends heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending.\nCompanies in the consumer services industry\nmay be subject to severe competition, which\nmay also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Companies in the consumer\nservices industry are facing increased\ngovernment and regulatory scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or regulatory\naction. Changes in demographics and consumer\npreferences may affect the success of consumer\nservice providers. Risk of Investing in the\nConsumer Staples Sector. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector may be adversely\naffected by changes in the global economy,\nconsumer spending, competition, demographics\nand consumer preferences, and production\nspending. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may also be affected by changes in\nglobal economic, environmental and political\nevents, economic conditions, the depletion of\nresources, and government regulation. For\ninstance, government regulations may affect\nthe permissibility of using various food\nadditives and production methods of companies\nthat make food products, which could affect\ncompany profitability. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector also may be subject to\n\n22\n\nrisks pertaining to the supply of, demand for\nand prices of raw materials. The prices of raw\nmaterials fluctuate in response to a number of\nfactors, including, without limitation,\nchanges in government agricultural support\nprograms, exchange rates, import and export\ncontrols, changes in international\nagricultural and trading policies, and\nseasonal and weather conditions. Companies in\nthe consumer staples sector may be subject to\nsevere competition, which may also have an\nadverse impact on their profitability. Risk of\nInvesting in the Energy Sector. Companies in\nthe energy sector are strongly affected by the\nchanges in and volatility of global energy\nprices, energy supply and demand, government\nregulations and policies, energy production\nand conservation efforts, technological\nchange, development of alternative energy\nsources, and other factors that they cannot\ncontrol. Energy companies may have relatively\nhigh levels of debt and may be more likely to\nrestructure their businesses if there are\ndownturns in energy markets or in the global\neconomy. If an energy company in a Fund's\nportfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could\nlose all or a substantial portion of its\ninvestment. The energy sector is cyclical and\nis highly dependent on commodity prices.\nPrices and supplies of energy may fluctuate\nsignificantly over short and long periods of\ntime due to, among other things, national and\ninternational political changes, Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d )\npolicies, changes in relationships among OPEC\nmembers and between OPEC and oil-importing\nnations, the regulatory environment, taxation\npolicies, the enactment or cessation of trade\nsanctions, war or other geopolitical\nconflicts, and the economies of key energy-\nconsuming countries. Companies in the energy\nsector may be adversely affected by terrorism,\ncyber incidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to predict and depend on a number\nof factors. The effect of these events or any\nrelated developments could be significant and\nmay have a severe adverse effect on the\nperformance of a Fund. Risk of Investing in\nthe Financials Sector. Companies in the\nfinancials sector include small, regional and\nmoney center banks, securities brokerage\nfirms, asset management companies, savings\nbanks and thrift institutions, specialty\nfinance companies ( e.g. , credit card,\nmortgage providers), insurance and insurance\nbrokerage firms, consumer finance firms,\nfinancial conglomerates and foreign banking\nand financial companies. Most financial\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which limits their\nactivities and may affect their ability to\nearn a profit from a given line of business.\nGovernment regulation may change frequently\nand may have significant adverse consequences\nfor companies in the financials sector,\nincluding effects not intended by the\nregulation. Direct governmental intervention\nin the operations of financial companies and\nfinancial markets may materially and adversely\naffect the companies in which a Fund invests,\nincluding legislation in many countries that\nmay increase government regulation,\nrepatriation and other intervention. The\nimpact of governmental intervention and\nlegislative changes on any individual\nfinancial company or on the financials sector\nas a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation\nof financial companies has been and continues\nto be subject to unprecedented volatility and\nmay be influenced by unpredictable factors,\nincluding interest rate risk and sovereign\ndebt default. Certain financial businesses are\nsubject to intense competitive pressures,\nincluding\n\n23\n\nmarket share and price competition. Financial\ncompanies in foreign countries are subject to\nmarket-specific and general regulatory and\ninterest rate concerns. In particular,\ngovernment regulation in certain foreign\ncountries may include taxes and controls on\ninterest rates, credit availability, minimum\ncapital requirements, bans on short sales,\nlimits on prices and restrictions on currency\ntransfers. In addition, companies in the\nfinancials sector may be the targets of\nhacking and potential theft of proprietary or\ncustomer information or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a material adverse\neffect on their businesses. The profitability\nof banks, savings and loan associations and\nother financial companies is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change; for instance, when interest\nrates go up, the value of securities issued by\nmany types of companies in the financials\nsector generally goes down. In other words,\nfinancial companies may be adversely affected\nin certain market cycles, including, without\nlimitation, during periods of rising interest\nrates, which may restrict the availability and\nincrease the cost of capital, and during\nperiods of declining economic conditions,\nwhich may cause, among other things, credit\nlosses due to financial difficulties of\nborrowers. In addition, general economic\nconditions are important to the operations of\nthese companies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Home Construction Industry.\nThe home construction industry may be\nsignificantly affected by changes in\ngovernment spending, zoning laws, economic\nconditions, interest rates, commodity prices,\nconsumer confidence and spending, taxation,\ndemographic patterns, real estate values,\noverbuilding, housing starts, and new and\nexisting home sales. Rising interest rates,\nreductions in mortgage availability to\nconsumers, increasing foreclosure rates or\nincreases in the costs of owning a home could\nreduce the market for new homes and adversely\naffect the profitability of home construction\ncompanies. Different segments of the home\nconstruction industry can be significantly\naffected by environmental clean-up costs and\ncatastrophic events such as earthquakes,\nhurricanes and terrorist acts. Home\nconstruction companies may lack\ndiversification, due to ownership of a limited\nnumber of properties and concentration in a\nparticular geographic region or property type.\nRisk of Investing in the Industrials Sector.\nThe value of securities issued by companies in\nthe industrials sector may be adversely\naffected by supply of and demand for both\ntheir specific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, companies in the industrials\nsector may be subject to liability for\nenvironmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Materials Sector.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety\n\n24\n\nand pollution control, among other factors.\nSuch risks may adversely affect the issuers to\nwhich the Fund has exposure. Companies in the\nmaterials sector are also at risk of liability\nfor environmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in the Real\nEstate Industry. Companies in the real estate\nindustry include companies that invest in real\nestate, such as real estate investment trusts\n( \u201c REITs \u201d ), real estate holding and\noperating companies or real estate development\ncompanies (collectively, \u201c Real Estate\nCompanies \u201d ). Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies exposes investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly, as well as to\nrisks that relate specifically to the way in\nwhich Real Estate Companies are organized and\noperated. The real estate industry is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and developments, and characterized\nby intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies involves various risks. Some risks\nthat are specific to Real Estate Companies are\ndiscussed in greater detail below.\nConcentration Risk. Real Estate Companies may\nown a limited number of properties and\nconcentrate their investments in a particular\ngeographic region or property type. Economic\ndownturns affecting a particular region,\nindustry or property type may lead to a high\nvolume of defaults within a short period.\nDistressed Investment Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in distressed, defaulted\nor out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and\nimplementation by a Real Estate Company of\nloan modification and restructure programs\ninvolves a high degree of uncertainty. Even\nsuccessful implementation may still require\nadverse compromises and may not prevent\nbankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also\ninvest in other debt instruments that may\nbecome non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt or erratic\nprice fluctuations. In addition, real estate\nis relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other capital\nexpenditures, the income and ability of a Real\nEstate Company to make payments of any\ninterest and principal on its debt securities\nwill be adversely affected. Loan Foreclosure\nRisk. Real Estate Companies may foreclose on\nloans that the Real Estate Company originated\nand/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate\nnegative publicity for the underlying property\nthat affects its market value. In addition to\nthe length and expense of such proceedings,\nthe validity of the terms of the applicable\nloan may not be recognized in foreclosure\nproceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by\nborrowers or other lenders may interfere with\nthe enforcement of rights by a Real Estate\nCompany. Parallel proceedings, such as\nbankruptcy, may also delay resolution and\nlimit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed\nloan by a Real Estate Company even where the\nproperty underlying the loan is liquidated.\nManagement Risk. Real Estate Companies are\ndependent upon management skills and may have\nlimited financial resources. Real Estate\nCompanies are generally not diversified and\nmay be subject to heavy cash flow dependency,\ndefault by borrowers and voluntary\nliquidation. In addition, transactions between\nReal Estate Companies and their affiliates may\nbe subject to conflicts of interest, which may\nadversely affect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\nshareholders. A Real Estate Company may also\nhave joint venture investments in certain of\nits properties, and, consequently, its ability\nto control decisions relating to such\nproperties may be limited.\n\n25\n\nProperty Risk. Real Estate Companies may be\nsubject to risks relating to functional\nobsolescence or reduced desirability of\nproperties; extended vacancies due to economic\nconditions and tenant bankruptcies;\ncatastrophic events such as earthquakes,\nhurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or\ncondemnation losses. Real estate income and\nvalues also may be greatly affected by\ndemographic trends, such as population shifts\nor changes in consumer preferences and values,\nor increasing vacancies or declining rents\nresulting from legal, cultural, technological,\nglobal or local economic developments.\nRegulatory Risk. Real estate income and values\nmay be adversely affected by such factors as\napplicable domestic and foreign laws\n(including tax laws). Government actions, such\nas tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other commercial restrictions or\nenvironmental regulations, also may have a\nmajor impact on real estate income and values.\nIn addition, quarterly compliance with\nregulations limiting the proportion of asset\ntypes held by a U.S. REIT may force certain\nReal Estate Companies to liquidate or\nrestructure otherwise attractive investments.\nSome countries may not recognize REITs or\ncomparable structures as a viable form of real\nestate funds. Underlying Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies make investments in a variety\nof debt and equity instruments with varying\nrisk profiles. For instance, Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in debt instruments\nsecured by commercial property that have\nhigher risks of delinquency and foreclosure\nthan loans on single family homes due to a\nvariety of factors associated with commercial\nproperty, including the tie between income\navailable to service debt and productive use\nof the property. Real Estate Companies may\nalso invest in debt instruments and preferred\nequity that are junior in an issuer\u2019s capital\nstructure and that involve privately\nnegotiated structures. Subordinated debt\ninvestments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine\nloans, involve a greater credit risk of\ndefault due to the need to service more senior\ndebt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred\nequity investments involve a greater risk of\nloss than conventional debt financing due to\ntheir non-collateralized nature and\nsubordinated ranking. Investments in\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities may also\nbe junior in priority in the event of\nbankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments\nin senior loans may be effectively\nsubordinated if the senior loan is pledged as\ncollateral. The ability of a holder of junior\nclaims to proceed against a defaulting issuer\nis circumscribed by the terms of the\nparticular contractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nA REIT that successfully maintains its\nqualification may still become subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes, including\nexcise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage\nrecording, and transfer taxes, both directly\nand indirectly through its subsidiaries.\nBecause REITs often do not provide complete\ntax information until after the calendar year-\nend, the Fund may at times need to request\npermission to extend the deadline for issuing\nyour tax reporting statement or supplement the\ninformation otherwise provided to you. Risk of\nInvesting in the Semiconductor Industry.\nSemiconductor companies face intense\ncompetition, both domestically and\ninternationally; such competition may have an\nadverse effect on profit margins.\nSemiconductor companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. The products of semiconductor\ncompanies may face obsolescence due to rapid\ntechnological developments and frequent new\nproduct introduction, unpredictable changes in\ngrowth rates and competition for the services\nof qualified personnel. Capital equipment\nexpenditures could be substantial and\nequipment generally suffers from rapid\nobsolescence. Companies in the semiconductor\nindustry are heavily dependent on patent and\nintellectual property rights. The loss or\nimpairment of these rights would adversely\naffect the profitability of these companies.\nRisk of Investing in Technology Companies.\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources and personnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence as well as\nunexpected risks and costs related to new\nproduct introduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning. Technology companies may\nbe adversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs.\n\n26\n\nRisk of Investing in the Telecommunications\nSector. The telecommunications sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of telecommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the\ntelecommunications sector may experience\ndistressed cash flows due to the need to\ncommit substantial capital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may make the\nproducts and services of certain\ntelecommunications companies obsolete.\nFinally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the telecommunications\nsector may be particular targets of hacking\nand potential theft of proprietary or consumer\ninformation or disruptions in service, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on their\nbusinesses. Risk of Investing in the Utilities\nSector. The utilities sector may be adversely\naffected by changing commodity prices,\ngovernment regulation stipulating rates\ncharged by utilities, increased tariffs,\nchanges in tax laws, interest rate\nfluctuations and changes in the cost of\nproviding specific utility services. The\nutilities industry is also subject to\npotential terrorist attacks, natural disasters\nand severe weather conditions, as well as\nregulatory and operational burdens associated\nwith the operation and maintenance of nuclear\nfacilities. Government regulators monitor and\ncontrol utility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility profits. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate\nnuclear generating facilities. Governmental\nauthorities may from time to time review\nexisting policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policy For the Funds, the Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for each\nFund\u2019s securities to BFA pursuant to the\nFunds' Proxy Voting Policy, and BFA has\nadopted policies and procedures (collectively,\nthe \u201c iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d )\ngoverning proxy voting by accounts managed by\nBFA, including the Funds. Under the iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote\nproxies related to Fund securities in the best\ninterests of a Fund and its shareholders. From\ntime to time, a vote may present a conflict\nbetween the interests of a Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, on the one hand, and those of\nBFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or\nBFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and\nprocedures that are designed to prevent undue\ninfluence on BFA\u2019s proxy voting activity that\nmight stem from any relationship between the\nissuer of a proxy (or any dissident\nshareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s affiliates, a Fund\nor a Fund\u2019s affiliates. Most conflicts are\nmanaged through a structural separation of\nBFA\u2019s Corporate Governance Group from BFA\u2019s\nemployees with sales and client\nresponsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains\nprocedures to ensure that all engagements with\ncorporate issuers or dissident shareholders\nare managed consistently and without regard to\nBFA\u2019s relationship with the issuer of the\nproxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law.\n\n27\n\nCopies of the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting\nPolicies are attached as Appendix A.\nInformation with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Funds' portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ended\nJune 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon\nrequest, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on\nits website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of a Fund\u2019s next net\nasset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: A Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of a Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to a Fund to settle\npurchases of a Fund ( i.e. Deposit Securities)\nor that Authorized Participants would receive\nfrom a Fund to settle redemptions of a Fund (\ni.e. Fund Securities). These files are known\nas the Portfolio Composition File and the Fund\nData File (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The\nFiles are applicable for the next trading day\nand are provided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an Authorized Participant or liquidity\nprovider the securities a Fund is willing to\naccept for a creation, and securities that a\nFund will provide on a redemption. BFA\nemployees may also discuss portfolio holdings-\nrelated information with broker/dealers, in\nconnection with settling a Fund\u2019s\ntransactions, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with the disclosure in the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent registration statement. \u2022\nCommunications with Listing Exchanges: From\ntime to time, employees of BFA may discuss\nportfolio holdings information with the\napplicable primary listing exchange for a Fund\nas needed to meet the exchange listing\nstandards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFunds, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Funds, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain a Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of a Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio- level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party.\n\n28\n\nThe Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nConstruction and Maintenance of the Underlying\nIndexes Descriptions of the Underlying Indexes\nare provided below. With respect to certain\nunderlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA\nor its affiliates have held discussions with\nthe applicable index provider regarding their\nbusiness interest in licensing an index to\ntrack a particular market segment and conveyed\ninvestment concepts and strategies that could\nbe considered for the index. The index\nprovider designed and constituted such indices\nusing concepts conveyed by BFA or its\naffiliates. For certain of these indices, the\nrelevant fund may be the first or sole user of\nthe underlying index. In its sole discretion,\nthe index provider determines the composition\nof the securities and other instruments in\nsuch underlying index, the rebalance protocols\nof the underlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and other instruments in the\nunderlying index, and any updates to the\nmethodology. From time to time, BFA or its\naffiliates may also provide input relating to\npossible methodology changes of such\nunderlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\nThe Dow Jones Indexes Dow Jones EPAC Select\nDividend Index Number of Components:\napproximately 100 Index Description. The Dow\nJones EPAC Select Dividend Index is an\nindicated annual dividend ( \u201c IAD \u201d ) yield-\ndriven weighted index that aims to measure the\nperformance of 100 high dividend paying stocks\nin non-U.S. developed markets. ( \u201c EPAC \u201d\nrefers to: Europe, Pacific, Asia, and Canada.)\nThe Underlying Index is composed of\napproximately 100 companies that pass the\ncriteria as outlined below. The Underlying\nIndex is denominated in U.S. dollars.\nComponent Selection Criteria. Securities of\ncompanies domiciled in Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea,\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.K., as of\nApril 30, 2024, are considered for inclusion\nin the Underlying Index, with the following\ngeneral rules and exceptions. Fixed-dividend\nshares, investment trusts, unit trusts,\nlimited liability companies (LLCs), business\ndevelopment companies (BDCs), special purpose\nacquisition companies (SPACs), ETFs, ETNs,\nclosed-end funds, mutual fund shares,\nconvertible bonds, equity warrants, limited\npartnerships (LPs), master limited\npartnerships (MLPs), preferred stock that\nprovides a guaranteed fix return and\nconvertible preferred stock are not eligible\nfor inclusion in the indexes. Index\nMethodology. The starting universe for the\nUnderlying Index is the S&P EPAC BMI and the\nS&P Canada BMI indexes, excluding real estate\ninvestment trusts. The eligibility criteria\nfor the Underlying Index are as follows: (i)\nthe company must have paid dividends in each\nof the previous three years; (ii) the\ncompany\u2019s current year trailing 12-month\ndividend-per-share ratio must be greater than\nor equal to its three-year average annual\ndividend-per-share ratio; (iii) the company\u2019s\nfive-year average dividend coverage ratio must\nbe greater than or equal to two-thirds of the\nfive-year average dividend coverage ratio of\nthe corresponding S&P BMI country index, or\ngreater than 118%, whichever is greater. If a\ncompany does not have five years of listing\nhistory, only available dividend amounts are\nconsidered in the ratio calculation. If the\ncompany has been listed for at least five\nyears but did not pay a dividend for one of\nthe past five years, a dividend of zero (0)\nwill be included in the ratio calculation;\n(iv) the company\u2019s securities must have a\nthree-month average daily trading value of at\nleast $3 million; (v) the company\u2019s securities\nmust have a non-negative trailing 12-month\nearnings per share; and\n\n29\n\n(vi) the company\u2019s securities must have a\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of at\nleast $1 billion ($750 million for current\nconstituents). Current index constituents are\nincluded in the index universe regardless of\nwhether they meet criteria (ii)-(v) above. To\nselect the 100 constituents, the Index\nProvider ranks the eligible securities by IAD\nyield and first includes all existing\nconstituents that are ranked in the top 200\nand then selects non-constituent stocks in\nrank order until the count reaches 100.\nConstituent weights are determined annually\nbased on tilted IAD yield, which is calculated\nby multiplying the constituent\u2019s IAD yield\n(capped at 20%) by the square root of its fair\nmarket capitalization. The weight of\nindividual securities is capped at the lower\nof 10% or five times the constituent\u2019s fair\nmarket capitalization weight within the\nUnderlying Index, using the float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization as of the third Friday\nof February. In addition, there is a 30% cap\non the aggregate weight of constituents within\neach Global Industry Classification Standard\nsector and each country of domicile. The\nUnderlying Index is reviewed daily based on\neach constituent\u2019s weight. Daily capping is\nperformed if the aggregate weight of\nconstituents with an individual weight greater\nthan 4.8% exceeds 24% of the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s total weight. If that threshold is\nbreached, the current constituent weights are\nrecapped, with the weights of individual\nconstituents capped at 10% and the aggregate\nweight of constituents with an individual\nweight greater than 4.5% capped at 22.5% of\nthe Underlying Index\u2019s total weight. IAD\nyields and tilted yield weights are not\nrecalculated if the capping thresholds are\nbreached throughout the year. When daily\ncapping is necessary, the changes are\nannounced after the close of the business day\non which the daily weight caps are exceeded,\nwith the reference date after the close of\nthat same business day, and the effective date\nof the changes is two business days later. A\nfreeze period on the daily capping is\nimplemented during the annual index\nreconstitution. The freeze period begins after\nthe market close on the Wednesday prior to the\nsecond Friday of March and ends after the\nmarket close on the Monday following the third\nFriday of March. Index Maintenance and Issue\nChanges. The Underlying Index is reconstituted\nannually and subject to a quarterly review\nprocess to maintain accurate representation of\nthe market segment represented by the\nUnderlying Index. Annual reviews take place\nafter the close of trading of all markets on\nthe third Friday in March. Constituent stocks\nremoved from the Underlying Index as a result\nof ongoing maintenance are replaced only at\nthe subsequent reconstitution. The only\nadditions between annual reconstitution are\nspin-offs. Maintaining the Underlying Index\nincludes monitoring and completing the\nadjustments for additions and deletions to the\nUnderlying Index, share changes, stock splits,\nstock dividends, and stock price adjustments\ndue to restructuring and spinoffs. A component\nstock is removed from the Underlying Index,\nindependent of the annual review, if it is\naffected by a corporate action such as a\ndelisting or bankruptcy. In addition,\ncomponent stocks are reviewed on a monthly\nbasis and may be removed if a company\nannounces that it will cease paying dividends\nfor an undetermined period or a company\nannounces a reduced dividend. Index\nAvailability . The Underlying Index is\ncalculated continuously and is available from\nmajor data vendors. The Underlying Index is\ncalculated in real-time and published every\nfive seconds. It is distributed via the\nChicago Mercantile Exchange and made available\nto international data vendors. Daily values\ncan be found at the S&P Dow Jones Indices\nwebsite. Exchange Rates and Pricing. Real-time\nspot Forex rates, as supplied by Refinitiv,\nare used in the calculation of the Underlying\nIndex. WM/Refinitiv foreign exchange rates\ntaken daily at 4:00 PM London Time are used in\nthe end-of-day calculation of the Underlying\nIndex. The Underlying Index is calculated in\nU.S. dollars.

The FTSE EPRA Nareit\nGlobal Real Estate Index Series (the \u201c FTSE\nEPRA Nareit Indexes \u201d ) was developed and is\nmaintained by FTSE International Limited ( \u201c\nFTSE \u201d ). The FTSE EPRA Nareit Indexes are\nprimarily rule-based but are also monitored by\nthe FTSE EPRA Nareit regional advisory\ncommittees. The FTSE EPRA Nareit Indexes are\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization-\nweighted. To qualify for inclusion in the FTSE\nEPRA Nareit Indexes, a security must be an\neligible security type traded in an eligible\ncountry, be listed on an official stock\nexchange and meet certain trading volume\nrequirements, as determined by FTSE.\nProspective constituents must have derived, in\nthe previous full financial year covered in\nthe latest annual report or prospectus, at\nleast 75% of their total consolidated EBITDA\nfrom relevant real estate activities. Relevant\nreal estate activities are defined as the\nownership, trading and development of income-\nproducing real estate. The construction of\nresidential homes for sale is considered\nrelevant real estate activity in all regions\nfor the EBITDA test. However, a company with\ngreater than 50% of its revenue from home\nconstruction activities is eligible only for\nemerging market indexes. In determining the\nnationality of a constituent, FTSE primarily\nconsiders the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation, the country of listing and the\ngeographic sources of its EBITDA. For the FTSE\nEPRA Nareit Indexes, the following are\nconsidered to be \u201c developed \u201d real estate\nmarkets: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada,\nDenmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong,\nIceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South\nKorea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K.\nand the U.S. The following are considered to\nbe \u201c emerging \u201d real estate markets: Brazil,\nChile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt,\nGreece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Kuwait,\nMalaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, the\nPhilippines, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi\nArabia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand,\nTurkey, and the United Arab Emirates. Subsets\nof the FTSE EPRA Nareit Global Index include\nthe FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index and the\nFTSE EPRA Nareit Global REITs Index. Index\nMaintenance. The FTSE EPRA Nareit Indexes are\nreviewed in March, June, September and\nDecember based on data as of the close of\nbusiness on the Monday four weeks prior to the\nreview effective date. Any constituent changes\nresulting from the quarterly review are\nimplemented after the close of business on the\nthird Friday ( i.e ., effective Monday) of\nMarch, June, September and December.\nSubsequent adjustments in stock weightings\n(including free float) become effective at the\nsame time. To be eligible for inclusion at the\nquarterly review, non-constituent securities\nmust meet certain thresholds for investable\nmarket capitalization (after the application\nof investability weightings) and liquidity, as\ndetermined by FTSE. Prospective constituents\nmust have at least 50% of their total assets\ninvested in real estate at the time of\nentering the index. Existing constituents are\nremoved at the quarterly review if their\ninvestable market capitalization (after the\napplication of investability weightings) falls\nbelow certain thresholds or if less than 65%\nof their total EBITDA is from relevant real\nestate activities. Existing constituents with\nat least 65% but less than 75% of EBITDA from\nreal estate activities have an additional year\nto meet the 75% threshold. If a constituent\nfails the liquidity screening conducted in\nMarch and September, it is removed at that\nquarterly review. A constituent is removed\nimmediately if it is delisted from its stock\nexchange or if the company enters bankruptcy,\nbecomes insolvent or is liquidated. Between\nreviews, a new issue that meets the regional\ninvestable market capitalization threshold\n(after the application of investability\nweightings) and certain other eligibility\ncriteria is included after the close of\nbusiness on its fifth day of trading. Index\nCalculation. The FTSE EPRA Nareit Indexes are\ncalculated based on price and total return\nmethodologies, both real time and end-of-day.\nNet total return versions of the indexes are\nalso available. WM/Reuters closing spot rates\nat 16:00 UK time are used for currency values.\nThe FTSE EPRA Nareit Indexes are calculated\nevery weekday when one or more of the\nconstituent stock markets are open for\ntrading. FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Green\nTarget Index\n\n31\n\nNumber of Components: approximately 356 Index\nDescription. The FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed\nGreen Target Index is an equity index designed\nto reflect the performance of securities from\nthe FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index (the \u201c\nParent Index \u201d ) that are weighted to target\nimproved sustainability-related metrics\nrelative to the Parent Index, subject to\ncertain constraints. The Parent Index is\ncomposed of REITs and real estate holding and\ndevelopment companies from developed market\ncountries or regions and may include large-,\nmid- and small-capitalization constituents.\nIndex Methodology. The Index Provider begins\nwith the Parent Index and excludes the\nsecurities of issuers that it identifies as\nbeing involved in any of the business\nactivities summarized below: \u2022 Manufacturing\ntobacco products ( e.g ., cigarettes, roll\nyour own tobacco, pipe tobacco, cigars,\ncigarillos, bidis, gutka, smokeless tobacco,\nheated tobacco products, electronic cigarettes\nand electronic nicotine delivery systems); or\nderiving 5% or more revenue from providing\ntobacco-related products or services or from\nthe supply, distribution and/or retail sale of\ntobacco products. \u2022 Producing and selling\nassault weapons, other firearms or key\ncomponents of any such weapons to civilian\ncustomers; or deriving 5% or more revenue from\nthe distribution and/or retail sale of assault\nweapons or other firearms. \u2022 Producing the\ncore weapon system of chemical or biological\nweapons, cluster munitions, anti-personnel\nmines, nuclear weapons, depleted uranium\nweapons or white phosphorus weapons\n(collectively, \u201c controversial weapons \u201d );\nproviding components or services for the core\nweapon system of controversial weapons, even\nif not essential for lethal use of the weapon;\nor having 20% or more voting rights in a\ncompany involved in such activities related to\ncontroversial weapons. \u2022 Deriving 5% or more\nrevenue from extracting oil sands, mining\nthermal coal or generating electricity from\nthermal coal. Additionally, the Index Provider\nexcludes companies that it determines are\ninvolved in controversies related to the ten\nUnited Nations Global Compact ( \u201c UNGC \u201d )\nprinciples, which are classified into four\ncategories: human rights, labor, environment\nand anti-corruption. After applying the\nexclusion screens, the Index Provider weights\nthe remaining securities to target, in\naggregate across the Underlying Index, (i) a\nminimum of 10% green certification; (ii) a 30%\nincrease in green certification relative to\nthe Parent Index; (iii) a 10% reduction in\nenergy usage relative to the Parent Index; and\n(iv) a level of carbon emission intensity that\nis no worse than that of the Parent Index.\nGreen certification is defined as the share of\ntotal net leasable area owned and/or managed\nby a constituent that is certified as part of\nan eligible green certification program. To be\neligible, a green certification program must\nbe transparent about how the sustainability\nperformance of assets is evaluated, including\npublicly available methodology documentation;\nprovide a publicly available list of certified\nassets; have a robust certification procedure,\nincluding formal credentialization and data\nvalidation ( e.g ., no self-certification);\nand include coverage of at least three\nsustainability-related indicators, one of\nwhich must be energy performance. Energy usage\nis defined as the average modeled energy\nconsumption, measured in kilowatt hours per\nsquare meter, of net leasable area owned\nand/or managed by a constituent. The Index\nProvider estimates energy usage on a building-\nby-building basis using individual building\nspecifications ( e.g ., type, size, year of\nconstruction) and local market data ( e.g .,\nsources of thermal energy vs. electricity).\nThe model is regularly calibrated by\nincorporating actual energy consumption data.\nCarbon emission intensity is defined as a\nconstituent\u2019s total Scope 1 and Scope 2\noperational emissions scaled by enterprise\nvalue including cash ( i.e ., the sum of\nmarket capitalization at fiscal year-end,\npreferred stock, minority interests, total\ndebt, and cash and cash equivalents). Scope 1\nemissions are direct greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG \u201d\n) emissions from sources that are controlled\nor owned by an organization. Scope 2 emissions\nare indirect GHG emissions associated with the\norganization\u2019s purchase of energy. The Index\nProvider estimates the carbon footprint for a\nbuilding using modeled energy consumption data\ncombined with national and/or sub-national\ndata on the carbon intensity of the local\nutility grid and energy mix. The Underlying\nIndex must have a beta (a measure of\nvolatility relative to the overall market)\nbetween 0.7 and 1.3 relative to the Parent\nIndex, using daily returns over the past two\nyears. In addition, the Underlying Index's\ncountry and sector exposure\n\n32\n\nmust be within 2% of the Parent Index weight.\nThe minimum weight for an individual\nconstituent is 0.005% of the Underlying Index,\nand the maximum weight is the lesser of 10% of\nthe Underlying Index or 10 times the\nconstituent\u2019s weight in the Parent Index. At\neach index review, the sector and country\nconstraints and the green certification and\nenergy usage targets may be relaxed if it is\ninfeasible to achieve all constraints and\ntargets. The first step is to relax the\ncountry and sector constraints in 1%\nincrements, up to +/- 10% of the Parent Index.\nIf there is still no solution, the green\ncertification and energy usage targets will be\nrelaxed iteratively in 2.5% increments until a\nsolution is reached. The Underlying Index will\nbe reviewed and reconstituted in December,\nwith the business involvement and UNGC\ncontroversy screens applied quarterly. FTSE\nEPRA Nareit Developed ex US Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 259 Index\nDescription. The FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed ex\nUS Index is a free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization-weighted index that is a subset\nof the FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index. The\nindex measures the stock performance of\ncompanies engaged in the ownership, trading\nand development of income-producing real\nestate in the developed real estate markets,\nexcept for the U.S., as such markets are\ndefined above. The index includes REITs and\nreal estate holding and development companies.\nFTSE EPRA Nareit Global REITs Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 338 Index\nDescription. The FTSE EPRA Nareit Global REITs\nIndex is a free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization-weighted index that is a subset\nof the FTSE EPRA Nareit Global Index. The\nindex is designed to track the performance of\npublicly listed REITs (or their local\nequivalents) in both developed and emerging\nmarkets, as those markets are defined above.\nConstituents must qualify for REIT (or its\nlocal equivalent) status in their country of\ndomicile. The S&P Indexes Component Selection\nCriteria for Domestic Indexes. S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC\u2019s ( \u201c SPDJI \u201d ) various Index\nCommittees are responsible for the overall\nmanagement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC's\nindices ( \u201c S&P DJI Indices \u201d ). Issuers ( i.e\n., the \u201c components \u201d ) selected for the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services LLC ( \u201c\nS&P \u201d ) U.S. indexes represent a broad range\nof industry segments within the U.S. economy.\nThe starting universe of publicly traded U.S.\nissuers classified by the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) is screened\nto eliminate ADRs, mutual funds, limited\npartnerships, royalty trusts, certain holding\nissuers, OTC bulletin board issues, pink\nsheet-listed issues, closed-end funds, ETFs\nand tracking stocks. REITs, except for\nmortgage REITs, are eligible for inclusion in\nthe Indexes. The stock of each constituent\nmust trade on either the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ), the NYSE Amex Equities\nor on Nasdaq. Additionally, only one share\nclass per constituent will be included in an\nIndex. The share class is selected by SPDJI\nand is generally defined as the largest, most\nliquid share class. Issuers with multiple\nshare classes will have the classes combined\nfor purposes of calculation of market\ncapitalization. The following criteria are\nthen analyzed to determine an issuer\u2019s\neligibility for inclusion in the S&P Indexes:\n(i) ownership of an issuer\u2019s outstanding\ncommon stock, in order to screen out closely\nheld issuers; (ii) trading volume of an\nissuer\u2019s shares, in order to ensure ample\nliquidity and efficient share pricing; and\n(iii) the financial and operating condition of\nan issuer. The S&P DJI\u2019s Indices are\ncapitalization-weighted, based on the\nfollowing formula: number of outstanding\nshares of a constituent (as determined by the\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization using\nSPDJI\u2019s methodology) multiplied by the\nconstituent\u2019s share price. Issuers with float-\nadjusted market capitalizations below certain\nthresholds are not eligible for the Indexes.\nIn addition, the market capitalization of an\nissuer eligible for inclusion typically must\nbe greater than the Index\u2019s minimum market\ncapitalization at the time it is being\nconsidered for Index inclusion. The market\ncapitalizations of an Index\u2019s components are\nadjusted to reflect changes in capitalization\nresulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock\nrights, substitutions and other capital\nevents. The market capitalizations of an\nIndex\u2019s constituent are adjusted for all\nstrategic holdings, including private,\ncorporate, and government holdings. Component\nSelection Criteria for International Indexes.\nStocks are eligible for the S&P Global Indices\nif they meet criteria for size, liquidity,\nprofitability, and sector and market\nrepresentation. Each of the S&P Global Indices\nis balanced across country and sector weights\nin the region/market. The S&P Global Indices\nbegin with an eligible investable universe of\nstocks covering\n\n33\n\napproximately 95% of each country\u2019s total\nmarket capitalization. In some cases, the S&P\nGlobal Indexes may include ADRs and GDRs.\nStocks with relatively small market\ncapitalization or insufficient liquidity are\nexcluded by SPDJI. To identify a candidate\npool for index constituent selection, all\nstocks are carefully examined using a set of\ngeneral criteria. The specific securities are\nthen screened for industry sector\nclassification; thus, the eligible securities\nare ranked according to GICS. Then, the Index\ncomponents, now determined, are weighted on\nthe basis of SPDJI\u2019s float-adjusted, market\ncapitalization methodology. Generally, SPDJI\nobserves a prospective constituent\u2019s liquidity\nover a period of at least twelve months before\nconsideration for inclusion. However, there\nmay be extraordinary situations when issuers\nshould be added immediately ( e.g. , certain\nprivatizations). When a particular issuer\ndominates its home market, it may be excluded\nfrom an Index if analysis of the sectors\nreveals that its securities are not as liquid\nas those of similar issuers in other\ncountries. Once a year, the float adjustments\nwill be reviewed and potentially changed based\non such review. The values of an Index\u2019s\ncomponents are adjusted to reflect changes in\ncapitalization resulting from mergers,\nacquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and\nother capital events. The market\ncapitalization of index constituent issuers is\nadjusted for all strategic holdings, including\nprivate, corporate, and government holdings.\nWith respect to the non-U.S. components of the\nS&P Global Indexes, the eligible universe of\nindex components that are considered for\ninclusion are from the following S&P DJI\nIndices: (i) the S&P/TSX 60 (Toronto Stock\nExchange), which represents the liquid, large-\ncap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in\nthe Canadian equities market; (ii) the\nS&P/TOPIX 150 (Tokyo Stock Exchange) which\nrepresents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the\npublicly listed issuers in the Japanese\nequities market; (iii) S&P/ASX All-Australian\n50 Index (Australian Stock Exchange), which\nrepresents the liquid, large-cap stocks in the\nAustralian equities market; (iv) the S&P Asia\n50, which represents the liquid, large-cap\nstocks of four major equities markets in Asia\n(Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and\nSingapore); (v) the S&P Latin America 40,\nwhich represents the liquid, large-cap stocks\nfrom major sectors of the Mexico, Brazil,\nPeru, Colombia and Chil\u00e9 equity markets; and\n(vi) the S&P Europe 350, which represents the\nliquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly\nlisted issuers in the region, covering\napproximately 70% of the region\u2019s market\ncapitalization. Issue Changes. General\noversight responsibility for the S&P DJI\nIndices, including overall policy guidelines\nand methodology, is handled by the S&P Global\nIndex Committee. Maintenance of component\ninvestments, including additions and deletions\nto these investments, is the responsibility of\nseparate regional index committees composed of\nS&P staff specialized in the various regional\nequity markets and, in some cases, with the\nassistance of local stock exchanges. Public\nannouncements of index changes as the result\nof committee decisions will generally be made\ntwo business days in advance of the\nanticipated effective date whenever possible,\nalthough for exceptional corporate events\nannouncements may be made earlier. Index\nMaintenance. Maintaining the S&P DJI Indices\nincludes monitoring and completing the\nadjustments for issuer additions and\ndeletions, share changes, stock splits, stock\ndividends, and stock price adjustments due to\nrestructuring and spin-offs. An issuer will be\nremoved from the S&P DJI Indices as a result\nof mergers/acquisitions, bankruptcy, or\nrestructuring. An issuer is removed from the\nrelevant index as close as possible to the\nactual date on which the event occurred. An\nissuer can be removed from an index because it\nno longer meets current criteria for inclusion\nand/or is no longer representative of its\nindustry group. All replacement issuers are\nselected based on the above component section\ncriteria. When calculating index weights,\nindividual components shares held by\ngovernments, corporations, strategic partners,\nor other control groups are excluded from the\nissuer\u2019s shares outstanding. Shares owned by\nother issuers are also excluded regardless of\nwhether they are index components. In\ncountries with regulated environments, where a\nforeign investment limit exists at the sector\nor issuer level, the constituent\u2019s weight will\nreflect either the foreign investment limit or\nthe percentage float, whichever is the more\nrestrictive. Each issuer\u2019s financial\nstatements will be used to update the major\nshareholders\u2019 ownership. However, during the\ncourse of the year, SPDJI also monitors each\nissuer\u2019s Investable Weight Factor ( \u201c IWF \u201d )\nwhich is SPDJI\u2019s term for the mathematical\nfloat factor used to calculate the float\nadjustment. If a change in IWF is caused by a\nmajor corporate action ( i.e. , privatization,\nmerger, takeover, or share offering) and the\nchange equal to or greater than 5%, a float\nadjustment will be implemented as soon as\nreasonably possible. Changes in the number of\nshares outstanding driven by corporate events\nsuch as stock dividends, splits, and rights\nissues will be adjusted on the ex-date. Share\nchanges of 5% or greater are implemented when\nthey occur. Material share changes\n\n34\n\nresulting from certain non-mandatory corporate\nactions follow the accelerated implementation\nrule. Non-material share changes are\nimplemented quarterly. Generally, index\nchanges due to rebalancing are announced two\ndays before the effective date by SPDJI. Index\nAvailability. The S&P Indexes are calculated\ncontinuously and are available from major data\nvendors. Exchange Rates. SPDJI uses the World\nMarkets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at\n4:00 p.m. London time for the following fund:\niShares Global Clean Energy ETF. Prior to\nJanuary 31, 2013, SPDJI used the currency\nexchange (FX) rate corresponding to 5:15 p.m.\nEastern time. In case World Markets/Reuters\ndoes not provide rates for specific markets on\ngiven days (for example, Christmas Day and New\nYear\u2019s Day), the previous business day\u2019s rates\nare normally used. SPDJI independently\nmonitors the exchange rates on all its\nindexes. SPDJI may under exceptional\ncircumstances elect to use alternative sources\nof exchange rates if the World Markets/Reuters\nrates are not available, or if SPDJI\ndetermines that the World Markets/Reuters\nrates are not reflective of market\ncircumstances for a given currency on a\nparticular day. S&P Global Clean Energy Index\nTM Number of Components: approximately 100\nIndex Description. The S&P Global Clean Energy\nIndex is designed to track the performance of\napproximately 100 clean energy-related\ncompanies. The Underlying Index is a subset of\nthe S&P Global Broad Market Index, and\nincludes stocks traded on developed and\nemerging market exchanges which meet or\nexceed, at the time of inclusion, $300 million\nin total market capitalization, $100 million\nin float-adjusted market capitalization, and\n$3 million median daily value traded over a\nsix-month period (or $2 million for existing\nconstituents). The index provider uses Global\nIndustry Classification Standard ( \u201c GICS \u201d )\nand FactSet\u2019s Revere Business Industry\nClassification System ( \u201c RBICS \u201d )\nclassifications, along with Trucost Power\nGeneration Data ( \u201c Trucost \u201d ) for utility\ncompanies to determine the eligible universe.\nCompanies that derive at least 25% in\naggregate revenue from clean energy related\nbusinesses as defined by RBICS data, companies\nin the Electric Utilities, Multi-Utilities, or\nIndependent Power Producers & Energy Traders\nsub-industries that generate at least 20% of\ntheir power from renewable sources as measured\nby Trucost data, companies in the GICS \u201c\nrenewable utilities \u201d sub-industry, and\ncompanies that had an exposure score\n(described in step 1 below) of at least 0.5 as\nof the previous rebalancing are included in\nthe preliminary universe of companies. In\naddition, the index provider uses company\nexclusion criteria related to business\nactivity ( e.g ., controversial weapons,\ntobacco, thermal coal, etc.) and other\nexclusionary guidelines based on a company\u2019s\ncompliance with the United Nations Global\nCompact ( \u201c UNGC \u201d ) provided by\nSustainalytics. Effective with the index\nreview in October 2024, the Index Provider\nwill utilize measurements from S&P Global\nBusiness Involvement Screens when monitoring\nthe company exclusion criteria related to\nbusiness activity ( e.g ., controversial\nweapons, tobacco, thermal coal, etc.). Lastly,\nthe index provider uses RepRisk, a leading\nprovider of business intelligence on\nenvironmental, social, and governance risks,\nfor screening and analysis of controversies\nrelated to companies within the index.\nCompanies without coverage are ineligible for\nindex inclusion until they receive such\ncoverage. After the index provider determines\nthe eligible universe, the index provider\nselects the index constituents as follows: 1.\nThe index provider defines clean energy\nexposure scores ( \u201c exposure scores \u201d ) for\neach company based on its primary business.\nCompanies determined by the index provider to\nhave maximum clean energy exposure are\nassigned a score of 1. Companies determined by\nthe index provider to have significant clean\nenergy exposure are assigned a score of 0.75,\nand companies determined by the index provider\nto have moderate clean energy exposure are\nassigned a score of 0.5. 2. The index provider\nnext calculates a carbon-to-revenue footprint\nstandard score by subtracting the mean carbon-\nto-revenue footprint of all preliminary\nuniverse stocks (before applying the exclusion\ncriteria described above) with an exposure\nscore of 1 as of the rebalancing reference\ndate from each stock\u2019s carbon-to-revenue\nfootprint and then dividing the difference by\nthe standard deviation (also determined based\non preliminary universe stocks with an\nexposure score of 1). The top and bottom five\npercent (5%) are excluded from the mean and\nstandard deviation calculations. The index\nprovider excludes any companies with a carbon-\nto-revenue footprint standard score of greater\nthan three. 3. All remaining exposure score 1\nstocks are selected, with a target constituent\ncount of 100. If more than 100 exposure score\n1 stocks are eligible, all exposure score 1\nstocks are selected. 4. If fewer than 100\nexposure score 1 stocks are eligible, stocks\nare ranked by the index provider based on\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization, and the\nhighest-ranking stock with an exposure score\nof 0.75 is selected and added to the index.\nThis process continues iteratively until the\ntarget constituent count is reached.\n\n35\n\n5. If, after step 4 there are still not 100\nconstituents, the highest-ranking stock with\nan exposure score of 0.5 is selected until the\ntarget constituent count of 100 is reached, or\nall eligible companies with exposure scores of\n1, 0.75, and 0.5 are selected. If after these\nsteps the index\u2019s weighted average exposure\nscore falls below 0.85, the lowest-ranking\nstock with an exposure score of 0.5 is removed\nuntil the index\u2019s weighted average exposure\nscore reaches 0.85. If the index\u2019s weighted\naverage exposure score remains below 0.85, the\nlowest-ranking stock with an exposure score of\n0.75 is removed until the Underlying Index\u2019s\nweighted average exposure score reaches 0.85.\nTherefore, while the Underlying Index targets\na constituent count of 100 securities, it is\npossible for the final index constituent count\nto be above or below 100 securities.\nConstituents are weighted based on the product\nof each constituent\u2019s float-adjusted market\ncapitalization and exposure score, with the\nweights of constituents capped at the lower of\neither a single constituent weight cap by\nexposure score (8% for an exposure score of 1,\n6% for an exposure score of 0.75 and 4% for an\nexposure score of 0.5), or five times its\nliquidity weight. The index provider\ndetermines the liquidity weight of a security\nas follows: index weight assigned to a\nsecurity based on the relative six\u2011month\nmedian daily value traded of the security\ncompared to that measure for the overall\nindex. In addition, the cumulative weight of\nall stocks within the index which have a\nweight greater than 4.5% cannot exceed 40%.\nInvestment Policies The Board has adopted as\nfundamental policies the following numbered\ninvestment policies, which cannot be changed\nwithout the approval of the holders of a\nmajority of the applicable Fund\u2019s outstanding\nvoting securities. A vote of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of each Fund is\ndefined in the Investment Company Act as the\nlesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities present at a shareholder meeting,\nif the holders of more than 50% of the\noutstanding voting securities of each Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (ii) more\nthan 50% of the outstanding voting securities\nof each Fund. Each Fund has also adopted\ncertain non-fundamental investment policies,\nincluding its investment objective. Non-\nfundamental investment policies may be changed\nby the Board without shareholder approval.\nTherefore, each Fund may change its investment\nobjective and its Underlying Index without\nshareholder approval. Fundamental Investment\nPolicies The iShares Environmentally Aware\nReal Estate ETF and iShares Global REIT ETF\nmay not: 1. Concentrate its investments in a\nparticular industry, as that term is used in\nthe Investment Company Act, except that the\nFund will concentrate to approximately the\nsame extent that its Underlying Index\nconcentrates in the securities of a particular\nindustry or group of industries. 2. Borrow\nmoney, except as permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act. 3. Issue senior\nsecurities to the extent such issuance would\nviolate the Investment Company Act. 4.\nPurchase or hold real estate, except the Fund\nmay purchase and hold securities or other\ninstruments that are secured by, or linked to,\nreal estate or interests therein, securities\nof REITs, mortgage-related securities and\nsecurities of issuers engaged in the real\nestate business, and the Fund may purchase and\nhold real estate as a result of the ownership\nof securities or other instruments. 5.\nUnderwrite securities issued by others, except\nto the extent that the sale of portfolio\nsecurities by the Fund may be deemed to be an\nunderwriting or as otherwise permitted by\napplicable law. 6. Purchase or sell\ncommodities or commodity contracts, except as\npermitted by the Investment Company Act. 7.\nMake loans to the extent prohibited by the\nInvestment Company Act. Each of the iShares\nGlobal Clean Energy ETF, iShares International\nDeveloped Real Estate ETF and the iShares\nInternational Select Dividend ETF will not: 1.\nConcentrate its investments ( i.e. , invest\n25% or more of its total assets in the\nsecurities of a particular industry or group\nof industries), except that the Fund will\nconcentrate to approximately the same extent\nthat the Underlying Index concentrates in the\nsecurities of a particular industry or group\nof industries. For purposes of this\nlimitation, securities of the U.S. government\n(including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities), repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities,\nand securities of state or municipal\ngovernments and their political subdivisions\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. 2. Borrow money, except that (i)\nthe Fund may borrow from banks for temporary\nor emergency (not leveraging) purposes,\nincluding the meeting of redemption requests\nwhich might otherwise require the untimely\ndisposition of securities; and\n\n36\n\n(ii) the Fund may, to the extent consistent\nwith its investment policies, enter into\nrepurchase agreements, reverse repurchase\nagreements, forward roll transactions and\nsimilar investment strategies and techniques.\nTo the extent that it engages in transactions\ndescribed in (i) and (ii), the Fund will be\nlimited so that no more than 33 1/3% of the\nvalue of its total assets (including the\namount borrowed) is derived from such\ntransactions. Any borrowings which come to\nexceed this amount will be reduced in\naccordance with applicable law. 3. Issue any\nsenior security, except as permitted under the\n1940 Act, as interpreted, modified or\notherwise permitted by regulatory authority\nhaving jurisdiction, from time to time. 4.\nMake loans, except as permitted under the 1940\nAct, as interpreted, modified or otherwise\npermitted by regulatory authority having\njurisdiction, from time to time. 5. Purchase\nor sell real estate unless acquired as a\nresult of ownership of securities or other\ninstruments (but this restriction shall not\nprevent the Fund from investing in securities\nof companies engaged in the real estate\nbusiness or securities or other instruments\nbacked by real estate or mortgages), or\ncommodities or commodity contracts (but this\nrestriction shall not prevent the Fund from\ntrading in futures contracts and options on\nfutures contracts, including options on\ncurrencies to the extent consistent with the\nFund\u2019s investment objective and policies). 6.\nEngage in the business of underwriting\nsecurities issued by other persons, except to\nthe extent that the Fund may technically be\ndeemed to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct, in disposing of portfolio securities.\nNotations Regarding each of the iShares\nEnvironmentally Aware Real Estate ETF's and\niShares Global REIT ETF's Fundamental\nInvestment Policies The following notations\nare not considered to be part of the iShares\nEnvironmentally Aware Real Estate ETF's and\niShares Global REIT ETF\u2019s fundamental\ninvestment policies and are subject to change\nwithout shareholder approval. With respect to\nthe fundamental policy relating to\nconcentration set forth in (1) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not define what\nconstitutes \u201c concentration \u201d in an industry.\nThe SEC staff has taken the position that\ninvestment of 25% or more of a fund\u2019s total\nassets in one or more issuers conducting their\nprincipal activities in the same industry or\ngroup of industries constitutes concentration.\nIt is possible that interpretations of\nconcentration could change in the future. The\npolicy in (1) above will be interpreted to\nrefer to concentration as that term may be\ninterpreted from time to time. The policy also\nwill be interpreted to permit investment\nwithout limit in the following: securities of\nthe U.S. government and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; securities of state,\nterritory, possession or municipal governments\nand their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\nthe iShares Environmentally Aware Real Estate\nETF's and iShares Global REIT ETF's industry\nclassifications, the Fund currently utilizes\nany one or more of the industry sub-\nclassifications used by one or more widely\nrecognized market indexes or rating group\nindexes, and/or as defined by Fund management.\nThe policy also will be interpreted to give\nbroad authority to the iShares Environmentally\nAware Real Estate ETF and iShares Global REIT\nETF as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits the iShares Environmentally Aware\nReal Estate ETF and iShares Global REIT ETF to\nborrow money in amounts of up to one-third of\nthe Fund's total assets from banks for any\npurpose, and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund's\ntotal assets from banks or other lenders for\ntemporary purposes. (Each Fund's total assets\ninclude the amounts being borrowed.) To limit\nthe risks attendant to borrowing, the\nInvestment Company Act requires the iShares\nEnvironmentally Aware Real Estate ETF and\niShares Global REIT ETF to maintain at all\ntimes an \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300%\nof the amount of its borrowings. Asset\ncoverage means the ratio that the value of the\niShares Environmentally Aware Real Estate\nETF's and iShares Global REIT ETF's total\nassets (including amounts borrowed), minus\nliabilities other than borrowings, bears to\nthe aggregate amount of all borrowings.\nBorrowing money to increase portfolio holdings\nis known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d Certain trading\npractices and investments, such as reverse\nrepurchase agreements, may be considered to be\nborrowings or involve leverage and thus are\nsubject to the Investment Company Act\nrestrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4\nunder the Investment Company Act, when the\niShares Environmentally Aware Real Estate ETF\nand iShares Global REIT ETF engage in reverse\nrepurchase agreements and similar financing\ntransactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain\nasset coverage of at least 300% with respect\nto such transactions and any other borrowings\nin the aggregate, or (ii) treat such\ntransactions as \u201c derivatives transactions \u201d\nand comply with Rule 18f-4 with respect to\nsuch transactions. Short-term credits\nnecessary for the settlement of securities\n\n37\n\ntransactions and arrangements with respect to\nsecurities lending will not be considered to\nbe borrowings under the policy. Practices and\ninvestments that may involve leverage but are\nnot considered to be borrowings are not\nsubject to the policy. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to underwriting\nset forth in (5) above, the Investment Company\nAct does not prohibit a fund from engaging in\nthe underwriting business or from underwriting\nthe securities of other issuers; in fact, in\nthe case of diversified funds, the Investment\nCompany Act permits a fund to have\nunderwriting commitments of up to 25% of its\nassets under certain circumstances. Those\ncircumstances currently are that the amount of\na fund\u2019s underwriting commitments, when added\nto the value of a fund\u2019s investments in\nissuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of those\nissuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund\nengaging in transactions involving the\nacquisition or disposition of portfolio\nsecurities may be considered to be an\nunderwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is\nnot believed that the application of the 1933\nAct provisions described above would cause a\nfund to be engaged in the business of\nunderwriting, the policy in (5) above will be\ninterpreted not to prevent a fund from\nengaging in transactions involving the\nacquisition or disposition of portfolio\nsecurities, regardless of whether a fund may\nbe considered to be an underwriter under the\n1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the\nunderwriting business to the extent permitted\nby applicable law. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit the iShares Environmentally\nAware Real Estate ETF and iShares Global REIT\nETF from making loans (including lending its\nsecurities); however, SEC staff\ninterpretations currently prohibit funds from\nlending more than one-third of their total\nassets (including lending its securities),\nexcept through the purchase of debt\nobligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies The\niShares Environmentally Aware Real Estate ETF\nand iShares Global REIT ETF have adopted a\nnon-fundamental policy not to make short sales\nof securities or maintain a short position,\nexcept to the extent permitted by the Fund's\nProspectus and SAI, as amended from time to\ntime, and applicable law. iShares Global Clean\nEnergy ETF, iShares International Developed\nReal Estate ETF and iShares International\nSelect Dividend ETF Each Fund has adopted a\nnon-fundamental policy not to invest in the\nsecurities of a company for the purpose of\nexercising management or control, or purchase\nor otherwise acquire any illiquid investment,\nexcept as permitted under the 1940 Act, which\ncurrently limits each Fund's holdings in\nilliquid investments to 15% of such Fund's net\nassets. BFA monitors Fund holdings in illiquid\ninvestments, pursuant to the Liquidity\nProgram. If any percentage restriction\ndescribed above is complied with at the time\nof an investment, a later increase or decrease\nin percentage resulting from a change in\nvalues of assets will not constitute a\nviolation of such restriction, except that\ncertain percentage limitations will be\nobserved continuously in accordance with\napplicable law. All Funds Each Fund has\nadopted a non-fundamental investment policy in\naccordance with Rule 35d-1 under the\nInvestment Company Act to invest, under normal\ncircumstances, at least 80% of the value of\nits net assets, plus the amount of any\nborrowings for investment purposes, in the\ncomponent securities of its Underlying Index\nor in depositary receipts representing\ncomponent securities in its Underlying Index.\nEach Fund also has adopted a policy to provide\nits shareholders with at least 60 days\u2019 prior\nwritten notice of any change in such policy.\nIf, subsequent to an investment, the 80%\nrequirement is no longer met, each Fund\u2019s\nfuture investments will be made in a manner\nthat will bring each Fund into compliance with\nthis policy. Each Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental policy not to purchase securities\nof other investment companies, except to the\nextent permitted by the Investment Company\nAct. As a matter of policy, however, each Fund\nwill not purchase shares of any registered\nopen-end investment company or registered unit\ninvestment trust, in reliance on Section\n12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the \u201c fund of funds \u201d\nprovisions) of the Investment Company Act, at\nany time each Fund has knowledge that its\nshares are purchased by another investment\ncompany investor in reliance on the provisions\nof subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).\n\n38\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all limitations\nunder each Fund's fundamental or non-\nfundamental investment policies apply only at\nthe time that a transaction is undertaken. Any\nchange in the percentage of each Fund's assets\ninvested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from market fluctuations\nor other changes in each Fund\u2019s total assets\nwill not require each Fund to dispose of an\ninvestment until BFA determines that it is\npracticable to sell or close out the\ninvestment without undue market or tax\nconsequences. Continuous Offering The method\nby which Creation Units are created and traded\nmay raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery requirement and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client\nmay be deemed a statutory underwriter if it\ntakes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into\nconstituent shares and sells such shares\ndirectly to customers or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of new shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the 1933 Act must take into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-\ndealer or its client in the particular case\nand the examples mentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions\nin shares, whether or not participating in the\ndistribution of shares, generally are required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in\nrespect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus delivery obligation with\nrespect to shares of the Funds are reminded\nthat, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act,\na prospectus delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange\nmember in connection with a sale on the\nListing Exchange generally is satisfied by the\nfact that the prospectus is available at the\nListing Exchange upon request. The prospectus\ndelivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\nan exchange. Management Trustees and Officers.\nThe Board has responsibility for the overall\nmanagement and operations of the Funds,\nincluding general supervision of the duties\nperformed by BFA and other service providers.\nEach Trustee serves until he or she resigns,\nis removed, dies, retires or becomes\nincapacitated. Each officer shall hold office\nuntil his or her successor is elected and\nqualifies or until his or her death,\nresignation or removal. Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Trust are referred to as\nindependent trustees ( \u201c Independent Trustees\n\u201d ). The registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nBlackRock-advised Funds \u201d ) are organized into\nthe BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex, the\nBlackRock Fixed-Income Complex and the iShares\nComplex (each, a \u201c BlackRock Fund Complex \u201d ).\nEach Fund is included in the iShares Complex,\nwhich includes iShares Trust, iShares U.S. ETF\nTrust, and iShares, Inc. Each Trustee also\nserves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a\nTrustee of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a\nresult, oversees all of the funds within the\niShares Complex, which consists of 412 funds\nas of August 30, 2024. With the exception of\nStephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron\nWasserman, the address of each Trustee and\nofficer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address\nof Mr. Kapito and Mr. Wasserman is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001. The address of Mr. Cohen is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., Drapers Gardens, 12\nThrogmorton Avenue, London EC2N 2DL United\nKingdom.

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Funds\nrests with the Board. The Board has engaged\nBFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis.\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing BFA\nand other service providers in the operations\nof the Funds in accordance with the provisions\nof the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of\nstate and other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter.\nThe Board is currently composed of eleven\nmembers, nine of whom are Independent\nTrustees. The Board currently conducts regular\nin person meetings four times a year. In\naddition, the Board frequently holds special\nin person or telephonic meetings or informal\nconference calls to discuss specific matters\nthat may arise or require action between\nregular meetings. The Independent Trustees\nmeet regularly outside the presence of\nmanagement, in executive session or with other\nservice providers to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Funds, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Funds with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the oversight functions delegated to\nthe Committee by the Board and reports its\nfinding to the Board. The Board and each\nstanding Committee conduct annual assessments\nof their oversight function and structure. The\nBoard has determined that the Board\u2019s\nleadership structure is appropriate because it\nallows the Board to exercise independent\njudgment over management and it allocates\nareas of responsibility among committees of\nIndependent Trustees and the full Board to\nenhance effective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Funds is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Funds. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of each\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Funds. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by each Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting each Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Funds'\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support each Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight\n\n47\n\nresponsibilities. From time to time, the Board\nmay modify the manner in which it conducts\nrisk oversight. The Board\u2019s oversight role\ndoes not make it a guarantor of the Funds'\ninvestment performance or other activities.\nCommittees of the Board of Trustees.

Certain activities of\nBFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively\nreferred to in this section as \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, with respect to the Funds and/or\nother accounts managed by BlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, including the business units or\nentities and personnel who may be involved in\nthe investment activities and business\noperations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in\nbusinesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Funds. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage a Fund and\nits shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by a Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Funds. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\na Fund's performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or client accounts, will be executed\nindependently of a Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFunds. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or\nsell the same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding a Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor a Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of a\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding a\nFund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for a Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause a Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so. Conflicts may also\narise because portfolio decisions regarding a\nFund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby a Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and\nthe purchase of a security or covering of a\nshort position in a security by a Fund may\nincrease the price of the same security held\nby (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its\nother accounts or funds. In addition, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, certain\nFunds may invest their assets in other funds\nadvised by BlackRock, including funds that are\nmanaged by one or more of the same portfolio\nmanagers, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to asset allocation, timing\nof Fund purchases and sales, and increased\nremuneration and profitability for BlackRock,\nand/or its personnel, including portfolio\nmanagers. In certain circumstances, BlackRock,\non behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from\nor sell securities to another fund or account\nadvised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is\nnot required to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such\n\n55\n\ntransactions. On any occasion when a Fund\nparticipates in a cross trade, BlackRock will\ncomply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which a Fund has\ninvested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of a\nFund's investments may be negatively impacted\nby the activities of BlackRock or its clients,\nand transactions for the Fund may be impaired\nor effected at prices or terms that may be\nless favorable than would otherwise have been\nthe case. The results of a Fund\u2019s investment\nactivities may differ significantly from the\nresults achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by a Fund.\nMoreover, it is possible that a Fund will\nsustain losses during periods in which one or\nmore proprietary or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock achieve significant\nprofits. The opposite result is also possible.\nFrom time to time, a Fund may be restricted\nfrom purchasing or selling securities, or from\nengaging in other investment activities\nbecause of regulatory, legal or contractual\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock or other\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock,\nand/or the internal policies of BlackRock\ndesigned to comply with such requirements. As\na result, there may be periods, for example,\nwhen BlackRock will not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions in certain\nsecurities or instruments with respect to\nwhich BlackRock is performing services or when\nposition limits have been reached. For\nexample, the investment activities of\nBlackRock for its proprietary accounts and\naccounts under its management may limit the\ninvestment opportunities for a Fund in certain\nemerging and other markets in which\nlimitations are imposed upon the amount of\ninvestment, in the aggregate or in individual\nissuers, by affiliated foreign investors. In\nconnection with its management of a Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on behalf of a Fund in\naccordance with such analysis and models. In\naddition, BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to make available any information\nregarding its proprietary activities or\nstrategies, or the activities or strategies\nused for other accounts managed by them, for\nthe benefit of the management of a Fund and it\nis not anticipated that BlackRock will have\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the\nactivities or strategies used for accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock or other client accounts\ncould conflict with the transactions and\nstrategies employed by BlackRock in managing a\nFund. The Funds may be included in investment\nmodels developed by BlackRock for use by\nclients and financial advisors. To the extent\nclients invest in these investment models and\nincrease the assets under management of the\nFunds, the investment management fee amounts\npaid by the Funds to BlackRock may also\nincrease. The price, availability and\nliquidity of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by model-\ndriven investment portfolios, as well as by\nBlackRock itself and by its advisory clients.\nIn addition, certain principals and certain\nemployees of a Fund\u2019s investment adviser are\nalso principals or employees of other business\nunits or entities within BlackRock. As a\nresult, these principals and employees may\nhave obligations to such other business units\nor entities or their clients and such\nobligations to other business units or\nentities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund\nin which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by a Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which a Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non a Fund could potentially lead to increased\npurchase activity with respect to the Fund and\nincreased assets under management for\nBlackRock.\n\n56\n\nBlackRock has entered into an arrangement with\nMarkit Indices Limited, the index provider for\nunderlying fixed-income indexes used by\ncertain iShares funds, related to derivative\nfixed-income products that are based on such\niShares funds. BlackRock may receive certain\npayments for licensing intellectual property\nbelonging to BlackRock and for facilitating\nthe provision of data in connection with such\nderivative products, which may include\npayments based on the trading volumes of, or\nrevenues generated by, the derivative\nproducts. However, BlackRock will not receive\nany such payments on those derivative products\nutilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds\nor accounts. Other funds and accounts managed\nby BlackRock may from time to time transact in\nsuch derivative products, which could\ncontribute to the viability or success of such\nderivative products by making them more\nappealing to funds and accounts managed by\nthird parties, and in turn lead to increased\npayments to BlackRock. Trading activity in\nsuch derivative products could also\npotentially lead to increased purchase\nactivity with respect to these iShares funds\nand increased assets under management for\nBlackRock. A Fund may, subject to applicable\nlaw, purchase investments that are the subject\nof an underwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse to those\nof the Fund. At times, these activities may\ncause business units or entities within\nBlackRock to give advice to clients that may\ncause these clients to take actions adverse to\nthe interests of a Fund. To the extent such\ntransactions are permitted, a Fund will deal\nwith BlackRock on an arm\u2019s-length basis. To\nthe extent authorized by applicable law,\nBlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent,\nlender or adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that\nthe commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs,\nfinancial advisory fees, underwriting and\nplacement fees, sales fees, financing and\ncommitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees,\ncompensation or profits, rates, terms and\nconditions charged by BlackRock will be in its\nview commercially reasonable, although\nBlackRock, including its sales personnel, will\nhave an interest in obtaining fees and other\namounts that are favorable to BlackRock and\nsuch sales personnel, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds\nmay use an index provider that is affiliated\nwith another service provider of a Fund or\nBlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer,\nagent, lender or in other commercial\ncapacities for a Fund or BlackRock. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel\nand other distributors) will be entitled to\nretain fees and other amounts that they\nreceive in connection with their service to\nthe Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities. No\naccounting to the Funds or their shareholders\nwill be required, and no fees or other\ncompensation payable by the Funds or their\nshareholders will be reduced by reason of\nreceipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other\namounts. When BlackRock acts as broker,\ndealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock\nmay take commercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Funds. A Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund's own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with a Fund's establishment of its\nbusiness relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund's counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund's creditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFunds. BlackRock will also receive\ncompensation for managing the reinvestment of\nthe cash collateral from securities lending.\nThere are potential conflicts of interests in\nmanaging a securities lending program,\nincluding but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto, among other things, increase or decrease\nthe amount of securities on loan or to lend\nparticular securities in order to generate\nadditional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock\nand its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto allocate loans to clients that would\nprovide more revenue to BlackRock. As\ndescribed further below, BlackRock seeks to\nmitigate this conflict by providing its\nsecurities lending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Funds and certain other\nclients and/or funds against a shortfall in\ncollateral in the event of borrower default.\nOn a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the\npotential dollar exposure of collateral\nshortfall resulting from a borrower default (\n\u201c shortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of\n\n57\n\nprogram-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-\nspecific indemnification exposure may affect\nthe amount of securities lending activity\nBlackRock may conduct at any given point in\ntime by reducing the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain loans (including by\nasset type, collateral type and/or revenue\nprofile). BlackRock uses a predetermined\nsystematic process in order to approximate pro\nrata allocation over time. In order to\nallocate a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock\nas a whole must have sufficient lending\ncapacity pursuant to the various program\nlimits ( i.e ., indemnification exposure limit\nand borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending\nportfolio must hold the asset at the time a\nloan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the\nlending portfolio must also have enough\ninventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. BlackRock may decline to\nmake a securities loan on behalf of a Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of a\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for a Fund may be\nbunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Funds will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Funds. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Funds will\nnot be charged the same commission or\ncommission equivalent rates in connection with\na bunched or aggregated order. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock may select brokers\nthat furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other\nBlackRock client accounts or personnel,\ndirectly or through correspondent\nrelationships, with research or other\nappropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Funds and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the\nFunds based on the amount of brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Funds and such other\nBlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client's commissions may not be\nused in managing that client's account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate benefits, of economies of\nscale or price discounts in connection with\nproducts and services that may be provided to\nthe Funds and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself. BlackRock\ndoes not currently enter into arrangements to\nuse the Funds' assets for, or participate in,\nsoft dollars, although BlackRock may receive\nresearch that is bundled with the trade\nexecution, clearing, and/or settlement\nservices provided by a particular broker-\ndealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives\nresearch on this basis, many of the same\nconflicts related to traditional soft dollars\nmay exist. For example, the research\neffectively will be paid by client commissions\nthat also will be used to pay for the\nexecution, clearing, and settlement services\nprovided by the broker-dealer and will not be\npaid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless\nprohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to\nexecute trades through brokers who, pursuant\nto such arrangements, provide research or\nother services in order to ensure the\ncontinued receipt of research or other\nservices BlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to\n\n58\n\nengage in the above described arrangements to\nvarying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited\nby applicable law, may also enter into\ncommission sharing arrangements under which\nBlackRock may execute transactions through a\nbroker-dealer, and request that the broker-\ndealer allocate a portion of the commissions\nor commission credits to another firm that\nprovides research to BlackRock. To the extent\nthat BlackRock engages in commission sharing\narrangements, many of the same conflicts\nrelated to traditional soft dollars may exist.\nBlackRock may utilize certain electronic\ncrossing networks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including,\nwithout limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock\nhas an investment or other interest, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law) in\nexecuting client securities transactions for\ncertain types of securities. These ECNs may\ncharge fees for their services, including\naccess fees and transaction fees. The\ntransaction fees, which are similar to\ncommissions or markups/markdowns, will\ngenerally be charged to clients and, like\ncommissions and markups/markdowns, would\ngenerally be included in the cost of the\nsecurities purchased. Access fees may be paid\nby BlackRock even though incurred in\nconnection with executing transactions on\nbehalf of clients, including the Funds. In\ncertain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume\ndiscounts that will reduce the access fees\ntypically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nonly utilize ECNs consistent with its\nobligation to seek to obtain best execution in\nclient transactions. BlackRock owns a minority\ninterest in, and is a member of, Members\nExchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly created U.S.\nstock exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be\nexecuted on MEMX if third party brokers select\nMEMX as the appropriate venue for execution of\norders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf\nof such Funds. In addition, transactions in\nFund shares may be executed on MEMX if third\nparty brokers select MEMX as the appropriate\nvenue for the execution of such orders.\nBlackRock has adopted policies and procedures\ndesigned to prevent conflicts of interest from\ninfluencing proxy voting decisions that it\nmakes on behalf of advisory clients, including\nthe Funds, and to help ensure that such\ndecisions are made in accordance with\nBlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its\nclients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such\nproxy voting policies and procedures, actual\nproxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have\nthe effect of favoring the interests of other\nclients or businesses of other divisions or\nunits of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock\nbelieves such voting decisions to be in\naccordance with its fiduciary obligations. For\na more detailed discussion of these policies\nand procedures, see the Proxy Voting Policy\nsection of this SAI. It is also possible that,\nfrom time to time, BlackRock and/or its\nadvisory clients (including other funds and\nseparately managed accounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, purchase and\nhold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund\u2019s\nassets may enhance liquidity, investment\nflexibility and diversification and may\ncontribute to economies of scale that tend to\nreduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock\nreserves the right, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, to sell into the market or\nredeem in Creation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of a Fund acquired for its own accounts\nor the account of a BlackRock advisory client.\nA large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund\nby BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory\nclient could significantly reduce the asset\nsize of the Fund, which might have an adverse\neffect on the Fund's liquidity, investment\nflexibility, portfolio diversification,\nexpense ratio or ability to comply with the\nlisting requirements for the Fund. It is\npossible that a Fund may invest in securities\nof, or engage in transactions with, companies\nin which BlackRock has significant debt or\nequity investments or other interests. A Fund\nmay also invest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for which\nBlackRock provides and is compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances. In making\ninvestment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is\nnot permitted to obtain or use material non-\npublic information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the activities\nof BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in\npurchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment. BlackRock, its\npersonnel and other financial service\nproviders may have interests in promoting\nsales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock\nand its personnel, the remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Funds or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFunds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFunds may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts.\n\n59\n\nThird parties, including service providers to\nBlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events\n(including, but not limited to, marketing and\npromotional activities and presentations,\neducational training programs and conferences)\nfor registered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors. There\nis a potential conflict of interest as such\nsponsorships may defray the costs of such\nactivities to BlackRock, and may provide an\nincentive to BlackRock to retain such third\nparties to provide services to a Fund.\nBlackRock may provide valuation assistance to\ncertain clients with respect to certain\nsecurities or other investments and the\nvaluation recommendations made for such\nclients' accounts may differ from the\nvaluations for the same securities or\ninvestments assigned by a Fund's pricing\nvendors, especially if such valuations are\nbased on broker-dealer quotes or other data\nsources unavailable to the Fund's pricing\nvendors. While BlackRock will generally\ncommunicate its valuation information or\ndeterminations to a Fund's pricing vendors\nand/or fund accountants, there may be\ninstances where the Fund's pricing vendors or\nfund accountants assign a different valuation\nto a security or other investment than the\nvaluation for such security or investment\ndetermined or recommended by BlackRock. As\ndisclosed in more detail in the Determination\nof Net Asset Value section in this SAI, when\nmarket quotations are not readily available or\nare believed by BFA to be unreliable, each\nFund\u2019s investments are valued at fair value by\nBFA. BFA has been designated as each Fund\u2019s\nvaluation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under\nthe Investment Company Act and acts through\nBFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c 2a-5\nCommittee \u201d ), with assistance from other BFA\npricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BFA using proprietary or third-party\nvaluation models, fair value represents only a\ngood faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of one or\nmore assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, a Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, a Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in a Fund bearing\nsome additional expenses. BlackRock and its\ndirectors, officers and employees, may buy and\nsell securities or other investments for their\nown accounts and may have conflicts of\ninterest with respect to investments made on\nbehalf of a Fund. As a result of differing\ntrading and investment strategies or\nconstraints, positions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees that are the\nsame, different from or made at different\ntimes than positions taken for a Fund. To\nlessen the possibility that a Fund will be\nadversely affected by this personal trading,\neach Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted\na code of ethics in compliance with Section\n17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts\nsecurities trading in the personal accounts of\ninvestment professionals and others who\nnormally come into possession of information\nregarding a Fund's portfolio transactions.\nEach code of ethics is available by contacting\nBlackRock at the telephone number on the back\ncover of each Fund\u2019s Prospectus or by\naccessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's\nInternet site at http://www.sec.gov, and\ncopies may be obtained, after paying a\nduplicating fee, by e-mail at\npublicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will not\npurchase securities or other property from, or\nsell securities or other property to, a Fund,\nexcept that a Fund may in accordance with\nrules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act\nengage in transactions with another Fund or\naccounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a\nresult of common officers, directors, or\ninvestment advisers or pursuant to exemptive\norders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock\nby the SEC. These transactions would be\neffected in circumstances in which BlackRock\ndetermined that it would be appropriate for a\nFund to purchase and another client of\nBlackRock to sell, or the Fund to sell and\nanother client of BlackRock to purchase, the\nsame security or instrument on the same day.\nFrom time to time, the activities of a Fund\nmay be restricted because of regulatory\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock and/or\nBlackRock's internal policies designed to\ncomply with, limit the applicability of, or\notherwise relate to such requirements. A\nclient not advised by BlackRock would not be\nsubject to some of those considerations. There\nmay be periods when\n\n60\n\nBlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of a Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which a Fund wishes to purchase\nor sell. However, if permitted by applicable\nlaw, and where consistent with BlackRock\u2019s\npolicies and procedures (including the\nnecessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Funds may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Funds. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Funds invest in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or are\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invest in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Funds) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Funds or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Funds), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the\nFunds), may limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Funds),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations. In addition to the\nforegoing, other ownership thresholds may\ntrigger reporting requirements to governmental\nand regulatory authorities, and such reports\nmay entail the disclosure of the identity of a\nclient or BlackRock\u2019s intended strategy with\nrespect to such security or asset. BlackRock\nmay not serve as an Authorized Participant in\nthe creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.\nIn order to defray transaction expenses and\nprotect against possible shareholder dilution,\nthe Funds may collect certain fees from\nAuthorized Participants in connection with\ncreation and redemption transactions. While\nBlackRock uses good faith estimates of the\nexpected costs to the Funds in determining the\nrates for fees collected by the Funds related\nto creation and redemption activity, BlackRock\nmay have incentives to improve Fund\nperformance through the collection of these\nfees. As these charges are based on estimates,\nwhere the charges exceed actual transaction-\nrelated costs and/or expenses incurred by a\nFund, Fund performance could improve as a\nresult. BlackRock has established processes to\noversee the determination of these estimates\nin an effort to mitigate this conflict.\nBlackRock may maintain securities indices. To\nthe extent permitted by applicable laws, the\nFunds may seek to license and use such indices\nas part of their investment strategy. Index\nbased funds that seek to track the performance\nof securities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\n\n61\n\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Funds using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to a Fund\nand the Funds are under no obligation to use\nBlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a\nlicense for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to a Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to a\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Funds,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to a Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to a Fund, or the selection\nof such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by a Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Funds, that engage\nthe service provider (typically the\ncustodian). A Fund\u2019s service provider\nremunerates BlackRock for the use of the\nsystems. A Fund service provider\u2019s payments to\nBlackRock for the use of these systems may\nenhance the profitability of BlackRock.\nBlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a service\nprovider in connection with the use of systems\nprovided by BlackRock may create an incentive\nfor BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider. In recognition of a BlackRock\nclient\u2019s overall relationship with BlackRock,\nBlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in a Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock (including BFA), its\ndirectors, officers and employees, in addition\nto those described in this section, may give\nrise to additional conflicts of interest.\nInvestment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services Investment Adviser. BFA\nserves as investment adviser to each Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and\nBFA. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is\nregistered as an investment adviser under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nUnder the investment advisory agreement, BFA,\nsubject to the supervision of the Board and in\nconformity with the stated investment policies\nof each Fund, manages and administers the\nTrust and the investment of each Fund\u2019s\nassets. BFA is responsible for placing\npurchase and sale orders and providing\ncontinuous supervision of the investment\nportfolio of each Fund. Pursuant to the\ninvestment advisory agreement, BFA may, from\ntime to time, in its sole discretion and to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to a Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay\n\n62\n\nterminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. BFA is\nresponsible, under the investment advisory\nagreement, for substantially all expenses of\nthe Funds, including the cost of transfer\nagency, custody, fund administration, legal,\naudit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Funds will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees).The following describes the\ncalculation of the management fee for each\nFund whose management fee is subject to\nbreakpoints. The management fee for all Funds\nis set forth in the table that follows the\ndescription of breakpoints. For its investment\nadvisory services to the iShares International\nSelect Dividend ETF, BFA is paid a management\nfee from the Fund calculated based on the\naggregate average daily net assets of the\nfollowing iShares funds: iShares Europe ETF,\niShares International Select Dividend ETF and\niShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap ETF. The\nmanagement fee for the Fund equals the ratio\nof the Fund\u2019s net assets over the aggregate\nnet assets of the above iShares funds\nmultiplied by the amount calculated as\nfollows: 0.5000% per annum of the aggregate\nnet assets less than or equal to $12 billion,\nplus 0.4750% per annum of the aggregate net\nassets over $12 billion, up to and including\n$18 billion, plus 0.4513% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $18 billion, up to\nand including $24 billion, plus 0.4287% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets over $24\nbillion, up to and including $30 billion, plus\n0.4073% per annum of the aggregate net assets\nin excess of $30 billion. For its investment\nadvisory services to the iShares Global Clean\nEnergy ETF, BFA is paid a management fee from\nthe Fund corresponding to the Fund's allocable\nportion of an aggregate management fee\ncalculated based on the aggregate average\ndaily net assets of the following iShares\nfunds: iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF,\niShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF,\niShares Global Clean Energy ETF, iShares\nGlobal Comm Services ETF, iShares Global\nConsumer Discretionary ETF, iShares Global\nConsumer Staples ETF, iShares Global Energy\nETF, iShares Global Financials ETF, iShares\nGlobal Healthcare ETF, iShares Global\nIndustrials ETF, iShares Global Infrastructure\nETF, iShares Global Materials ETF, iShares\nGlobal Tech ETF, iShares Global Timber &\nForestry ETF, iShares Global Utilities ETF,\niShares North American Natural Resources ETF,\niShares Semiconductor ETF, iShares U.S.\nDigital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF.\nThe aggregate management fee is calculated as\nfollows: 0.4800% per annum of the aggregate\nnet assets less than or equal to $10.0\nbillion, plus 0.4300% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $10.0 billion, up to\nand including $20.0 billion, plus 0.3800% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets over $20.0\nbillion, up to and including $30.0 billion,\nplus 0.3420% per annum of the aggregate net\nassets over $30.0 billion, up to and including\n$40.0 billion, plus 0.3078% per annum of the\naggregate net assets in excess of $40.0\nbillion. BFA may from time to time voluntarily\nwaive and/or reimburse fees or expenses to\nreduce the Total Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver\nor reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at\nany time.

The investment advisory agreement\nwith respect to each Fund continues in effect\nfor two years from its effective date, and\nthereafter is subject to annual approval by\n(i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of a majority\nof the outstanding voting securities (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act) of the applicable\nFund, provided that in either event such\ncontinuance also is approved by a majority of\nthe Board members who are not interested\npersons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\napplicable Fund, by a vote cast in person at a\nmeeting called for the purpose of voting on\nsuch approval. The investment advisory\nagreement with respect to each Fund is\nterminable without penalty, on 60 days\u2019\nnotice, by the Board or by a vote of the\nholders of a majority of the applicable Fund\u2019s\noutstanding voting securities (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act).

Portfolio Managers.

As a consequence, from time to\ntime each Fund may receive a smaller\nallocation of an investment opportunity than\nit would have if the Portfolio Managers and\nBFA and its affiliates did not manage other\nportfolios or accounts.\n\n64\n\nLike the Funds, the other portfolios or\naccounts for which the Portfolio Managers are\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management generally pay an asset-\nbased fee to BFA or its affiliates, as\napplicable, for its advisory services. One or\nmore of those other portfolios or accounts,\nhowever, may pay BFA or its affiliates a\nperformance-based fee in lieu of, or in\naddition to, an asset-based fee for its\nadvisory services. A portfolio or account with\na performance-based fee would pay BFA or its\naffiliates a portion of that portfolio\u2019s or\naccount\u2019s gains, or would pay BFA or its\naffiliates more for its services than would\notherwise be the case if BFA or any of its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Funds should be aware\nthat, as with any group of portfolios and\naccounts managed by an investment adviser\nand/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below show, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of April 30, 2024:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts        Performance   Total Assets  \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1  $2,853,000,0\u2026  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of April 30, 2024.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources.

The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the\n\n65\n\nteam relative to the portfolios\u2019 investment\nobjectives (which in the case of index ETFs\nwould be how closely the ETF tracks its\nUnderlying Index), and the individual\u2019s\nperformance and contribution to the overall\nperformance of these portfolios and BlackRock.\nDiscretionary incentive compensation is paid\nin cash up to a certain threshold with the\nremaining portion represented by deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In some cases,\nadditional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may\nbe granted to certain key employees as part of\na long-term incentive award to aid in\nretention, align interests with long-term\nshareholders and motivate performance. As of\nApril 30, 2024, the Portfolio Managers did not\nbeneficially own shares of each Fund. Codes of\nEthics.

Distributor. The\nDistributor's principal address is 50 Hudson\nYards, New York, NY 10001. Shares are\ncontinuously offered for sale by the Funds\nthrough the Distributor or its agent only in\nCreation Units, as described in the applicable\nProspectus and below in the Creation and\nRedemption of Creation Units section of this\nSAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits are generally not distributed by the\nDistributor or its agent. The Distributor or\nits agent will arrange for the delivery of the\n\n66\n\napplicable Prospectus and, upon request, this\nSAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and\nwill maintain records of both orders placed\nwith it or its agents and confirmations of\nacceptance furnished by it or its agents. The\nDistributor is a broker-dealer registered\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,\nInc.

BFA or its\naffiliates may, from time to time and from its\nown resources, pay, defray or absorb costs\nrelating to distribution, including payments\nout of its own resources to the Distributor,\nor to otherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that a Fund\nengages in securities lending, each Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Funds,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA,\npursuant to a written agreement (the \u201c\nSecurities Lending Agency Agreement \u201d ). Each\nFund retains a portion of the securities\nlending income and remits the remaining\nportion to BTC as compensation for its\nservices as securities lending agent.\nSecurities lending income is generally equal\nto the total of income earned from the\nreinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes\ncollateral investment fees as defined below),\nand any fees or other payments to and from\nborrowers of securities. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each\nFund is responsible for fees in connection\nwith the investment of cash collateral\nreceived for securities on loan in a money\nmarket fund managed by BFA (the \u201c collateral\ninvestment fees \u201d ); however, BTC has agreed\nto reduce the amount of securities lending\nincome it receives in order to effectively\nlimit the collateral investment fees the Fund\nbears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money\nmarket fund shares will not be subject to a\nsales load, redemption fee, distribution fee\nor service fee. Under the securities lending\nprogram, the Funds are categorized into one of\nseveral specific asset classes. The\ndetermination of a Fund\u2019s asset class category\n(fixed-income, domestic equity, international\nequity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be\nsubject to a different fee arrangement, is\nbased on a methodology agreed to by the Trust\nand BTC. Pursuant to the current Securities\nLending Agency Agreement: (i) domestic equity\nfunds, such as the iShares Global REIT ETF ( \u201c\nDomestic Equity Fund \u201d ), retain 81% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees) and (ii) this\namount could never be less than 70% of the sum\nof securities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees. (i) international equity\nfunds, such as the iShares Environmentally\nAware Real Estate ETF, iShares Global Clean\nEnergy ETF, iShares International Developed\nReal Estate ETF and iShares International\nSelect Dividend ETF ( \u201c International Equity\nFunds \u201d ), retain 82% of securities lending\nincome (which excludes collateral investment\nfees), and (ii) this amount can never be less\nthan 70% of the sum of securities lending\nincome plus collateral investment fees. In\naddition, commencing the business day\nfollowing the date that the aggregate\nsecurities lending income (which includes, for\nthis purpose, collateral investment fees)\nearned across the iShares Complex (as defined\nin the Management \u2014 Trustees and Officers\nsection of this SAI) in a calendar year\nexceeds a specified threshold, each applicable\nFund, pursuant to the current Securities\nLending Agency Agreement, will receive for the\nremainder of that calendar year securities\nlending income as follows: Domestic Equity\nFund (i) 81% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees);\nand (ii) this amount can never be less than\n70% of the sum of securities lending income\nplus collateral investment fees. International\nEquity Funds\n\n67\n\n(i) 85% of securities lending income (which\nexcludes collateral investment fees); and (ii)\nthis amount can never be less than 70% of the\nsum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees. The services\nprovided to the Funds by BTC in the most\nrecent fiscal year ended April 30, 2024\nprimarily included the following: (1)\nselecting borrowers from an approved list of\nborrowers and executing a securities lending\nagreement as agent on behalf of the Funds with\neach such borrower; (2) negotiating the terms\nof securities loans, including the amount of\nfees; (3) directing the delivery of loaned\nsecurities; (4) monitoring the daily value of\nthe loaned securities and directing the\npayment of additional collateral or the return\nof excess collateral, as necessary; (5)\ninvesting cash collateral received in\nconnection with any loaned securities; (6)\nmonitoring distributions on loaned securities\n(for example, interest and dividend activity);\n(7) in the event of default by a borrower with\nrespect to any securities loan, using the\ncollateral or the proceeds of the liquidation\nof collateral to purchase replacement\nsecurities of the same issue, type, class and\nseries as that of the loaned securities; and\n(8) terminating securities loans and arranging\nfor the return of loaned securities to the\nFunds at loan termination. The following\ntables show the dollar amounts of income and\nfees/compensation related to the securities\nlending activities of each Fund during its\nmost recent fiscal year ended April 30, 2024.\n

BFA and/or\nits affiliates ( \u201c BFA Entities \u201d ) may pay\ncertain broker-dealers, registered investment\nadvisers, banks and other financial\nintermediaries ( \u201c Intermediaries \u201d ) for\ncertain activities related to the Funds, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products in\ngeneral. BFA Entities make these payments from\ntheir own assets and not from the assets of\nthe Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities\u2019\nrevenue comes directly or indirectly in part\nfrom fees paid by the Funds, other iShares\nfunds (including, if applicable, any\nunderlying iShares funds held by a Fund) or\nexchange-traded products, these payments do\nnot increase the price paid by investors for\nthe purchase of shares of, or the cost of\nowning, the Funds, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products. BFA Entities make\npayments for Intermediaries\u2019 participation in\nactivities that are designed to make\nregistered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Funds and other iShares funds,\nor for other activities, such as participation\nin marketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Funds,\nother iShares funds or exchange-traded\nproducts ( \u201c Publishing Costs \u201d ). In\naddition, BFA Entities make payments to\nIntermediaries that make shares of the Funds,\nother iShares funds or exchange-traded\nproducts available to their clients, in some\ncases at a waived or reduced commission rate\nor ticket charge, develop new products that\nfeature iShares, create educational content\nabout the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products that is featured on\nan Intermediary\u2019s platform, or otherwise\npromote the Funds, other iShares funds and\nexchange-traded products. BFA Entities may\nalso reimburse expenses or make payments from\ntheir own\n\n70\n\nassets to Intermediaries or other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\niShares business or facilitate investment in\nthe Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. Payments of the type\ndescribed above are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Funds, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products, or otherwise promote\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm. In addition to\nthe payments described above, BFA Entities\nhave developed proprietary tools, calculators\nand related interactive or digital content\nthat is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Funds, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, American Enterprise\nInvestment Services Inc., Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Cetera Financial Group, Inc., Charles\nSchwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre\nAG, Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey\nWright and Associates, LLC, Dynasty Financial\nPartners LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC,\nEnvestnet Asset Management, Inc., eToro USA\nSecurities Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill\nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated,\nMorgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Northwestern\nMutual Investment Services, LLC, Orion\nPortfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public\nHoldings, Inc., Raymond James Financial\nServices, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary\nWealth Group, LLC, Stash Investments LLC, TD\nAmeritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc.,\nWells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells\nFargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\n\n71\n\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFunds, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Funds, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Funds may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Funds would pay a\nfee to the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity\nand quality of the secondary market of\nsecurities of a Fund. The fee would then be\ncredited by the exchange to one or more market\nmakers that meet or exceed liquidity and\nmarket quality standards with respect to the\nsecurities of a Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of a\nFund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will\nnot be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds\nmanaged by BFA may also participate in such\nprograms. Determination of Net Asset Value\nValuation of Shares. The NAV for each Fund is\ngenerally calculated as of the close of\nregular trading hours on the NYSE (normally\n4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each business day\nthe NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held by\na Fund is as follows: Equity Investments.\nEquity securities traded on a recognized\nsecurities exchange ( e.g. , NYSE), on\nseparate trading boards of a securities\nexchange or through a market system that\nprovides contemporaneous transaction pricing\ninformation (each an \u201c Exchange \u201d ) are valued\nusing information obtained via independent\npricing services, generally at the closing\nprice or, if an Exchange closing price is not\navailable, the last traded price on that\nExchange prior to the time as of which the\nassets or liabilities are valued. However,\nunder certain circumstances, other means of\ndetermining current market value may be used.\nIf an equity security is traded on more than\none Exchange, the current market value of the\nsecurity where it is primarily traded\ngenerally will be used. In the event that\nthere are no sales involving an equity\nsecurity held by a Fund on a day on which a\nFund values such security, the prior day\u2019s\nprice will be used, unless BFA determines that\nsuch prior day\u2019s price no longer reflects the\nfair value of the security, in which case such\nasset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset\n(as defined below). Options, Futures, Swaps\nand Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded equity\noptions (except those that are customized) for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values\nsuch option, the last bid (long positions) or\nask (short positions) price, if available,\nwill be used as the value of such option. If\nno bid or ask price is available on a day on\nwhich a Fund values such option, the prior\nday\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value a Fund\u2019s securities and other\nassets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time a Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich a Fund valued such security, the revised\npricing service quotation generally will be\napplied prospectively. Such determination will\nbe made considering pertinent facts and\ncircumstances surrounding the revision. The\nprice a Fund could receive upon the sale of\nany particular portfolio investment may differ\nfrom a Fund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for assets that trade in thin or\nvolatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation methodology or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. As a\nresult, the price received upon the sale of an\ninvestment may be less than the value ascribed\nby a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain\n\n72\n\nupon the sale of the investment. A Fund\u2019s\nability to value its investment may also be\nimpacted by technological issues and/or errors\nby pricing services or other third-party\nservice providers. All cash, receivables and\ncurrent payables are carried on a Fund\u2019s books\nat their fair value. In the event that\napplication of the methods of valuation\ndiscussed above result in a price for a\nsecurity which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, each Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by a Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. Use of\nfair value prices and certain current market\nvaluations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used in the Underlying\nIndex, which, in turn, could result in a\ndifference between a Fund\u2019s performance and\nthe performance of the Underlying Index. Fair\nValue. When market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, a Fund\u2019s investments are valued at\nfair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing a Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, a Fund. On\nany day the NYSE is open and a foreign market\nor the primary exchange on which a foreign\nasset or liability is traded is closed, such\nasset or liability will be valued using the\nprior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA is not\naware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. For certain foreign assets, a third-\nparty vendor supplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the movement of\na proprietary multi-factor model after the\nrelevant foreign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing methodology is\ndesigned to correlate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S. markets\nfollowing the close of the local markets to\nthe prices that might have prevailed as of a\nFund\u2019s pricing time. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee\nis responsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a\nFund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair\nValue Assets is subsequently reported to the\nBoard or a committee thereof. When determining\nthe price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will\nseek to determine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on which\nthe asset or liability is being valued, and\ndoes not seek to determine the price a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair\nvalue determinations will be based upon all\navailable factors that BFA deems relevant at\nthe time of the determination, and may be\nbased on analytical values determined by BFA\nusing proprietary or third-party valuation\nmodels. Fair value represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. When determining the fair value of\nan investment, one or more fair value\nmethodologies may be used (depending on\ncertain factors, including the asset type).\nFor example, the investment may be initially\npriced based on the original cost of the\ninvestment or, alternatively, using\nproprietary or third-party models that may\nrely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\n\n73\n\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nEach Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect a\nFund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to a Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Funds,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, a Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including a\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause a Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for a Fund and may take into account\na variety of factors including: (i) the size,\nnature and character of the security or\ninstrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time, a\nFund may purchase new issues of securities in\na fixed price offering. In these situations,\nthe broker may be a member of the selling\ngroup that will, in addition to selling\nsecurities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e).\n\n74\n\nThe Funds anticipate that brokerage\ntransactions involving foreign equity\nsecurities generally will be conducted\nprimarily on the principal stock exchanges of\nthe applicable country. Foreign equity\nsecurities may be held by the Funds in the\nform of depositary receipts, or other\nsecurities convertible into foreign equity\nsecurities. Depositary receipts may be listed\non stock exchanges, or traded in OTC markets\nin the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be.\nADRs, like other securities traded in the\nU.S., will be subject to negotiated commission\nrates. OTC issues, including most fixed-income\nsecurities such as corporate debt and U.S.\nGovernment securities, are normally traded on\na \u201c net \u201d basis without a stated commission,\nthrough dealers acting for their own account\nand not as brokers. The Funds will primarily\nengage in transactions with these dealers or\ndeal directly with the issuer unless a better\nprice or execution could be obtained by using\na broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit. Under the 1940\nAct, persons affiliated with a Fund and\npersons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the dealers\nacting as principal for their own accounts,\nthe Funds will not deal with affiliated\npersons and affiliated persons of such\naffiliated persons in connection with such\ntransactions. The Funds will not purchase\nsecurities during the existence of any\nunderwriting or selling group relating to such\nsecurities of which BFA, BRIL or any\naffiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nthereof is a member except pursuant to\nprocedures adopted by the Board in accordance\nwith Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act. Purchases\nof money market instruments by the Funds are\nmade from dealers, underwriters and issuers.\nThe Funds do not currently expect to incur any\nbrokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Funds with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Funds\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. IPOs of\nsecurities may be over-subscribed and\nsubsequently trade at a premium in the\nsecondary market. When BFA is given an\nopportunity to invest in such an initial\noffering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue, the\nsupply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for\n\n75\n\nparticular client accounts that are managed by\nportfolio teams who have indicated interest in\nthe offering based on market capitalization of\nthe issuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in a Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well. Because different\naccounts may have differing investment\nobjectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell\nthe same securities at the same time for\ndifferent clients based on the particular\ninvestment objective, guidelines and\nstrategies of those accounts. For example, BFA\nmay decide that it may be entirely appropriate\nfor a growth fund to sell a security at the\nsame time a value fund is buying that\nsecurity. To the extent that transactions on\nbehalf of more than one client of BFA or the\nother Affiliates during the same period\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, there may be an adverse effect on price.\nFor example, sales of a security by BlackRock\non behalf of one or more of its clients may\ndecrease the market price of such security,\nadversely impacting other BlackRock clients\nthat still hold the security. If purchases or\nsales of securities arise for consideration at\nor about the same time that would involve the\nFunds or other clients or funds for which BFA\nor another Affiliate act as investment\nmanager, transactions in such securities will\nbe made, insofar as feasible, for the\nrespective funds and clients in a manner\ndeemed equitable to all. In certain instances,\nBFA may find it efficient for purposes of\nseeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate\nor \u201c bunch \u201d certain contemporaneous purchases\nor sale orders of its advisory accounts and\nadvisory accounts of affiliates. In general,\nall contemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Funds are\nconcerned, in other cases it could be\nbeneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected\nby BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of\nmore than one of its clients during the same\nperiod may increase the demand for securities\nbeing purchased or the supply of securities\nbeing sold, causing an adverse effect on\nprice. The trader will give the bunched order\nto the broker-dealer that the trader has\nidentified as being able to provide the best\nexecution of the order. Orders for purchase or\nsale of securities will be placed within a\nreasonable amount of time of the order receipt\nand bunched orders will be kept bunched only\nlong enough to execute the order. The tables\nbelow set forth the brokerage commissions paid\nby each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any\ndifferences in brokerage commissions paid by a\nFund from year to year are principally due to\nincreases or decreases in that Fund\u2019s assets\nover those periods or the magnitude of changes\nto the components of a Fund's Underlying\nIndex:\n                                              \n            Brokerag\u2026  Brokerage\u2026  Brokerag\u2026  \n                sPaid       sPaid      sPaid  \n            DuringFi\u2026  DuringFis\u2026  DuringFi\u2026  \n            YearEnded   YearEnded  YearEnded  \n            April 30,   April 30,  April 30,  \n  Fund           2024        2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  iShares                                     \n  Environ\u2026                                    \n  Aware          $546        $163       $N/A  \n  Real                                        \n  Estate                                      \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Global                                      \n  Clean     1,202,822   2,071,735  1,698,965  \n  Energy                                      \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Global      124,437     126,848    151,564  \n  REIT ETF                                    \n  iShares                                     \n  Interna\u2026                                    \n  Develop\u2026      9,010      10,091     20,416  \n  Real                                        \n  EstateE\u2026                                    \n  iShares                                     \n  Interna\u2026                                    \n  Select      959,952     670,849    839,141  \n  Dividend                                    \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nThe Funds did not pay any brokerage\ncommissions to BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, or\nto any other broker-dealer that is part of the\nBlackRock group of companies, during the\nfiscal year ended April 30, 2024.\n\n76\n\nThe Funds' purchase and sale orders for\nsecurities may be combined with those of other\ninvestment companies, clients or accounts that\nBlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or\nsales of portfolio securities of the Funds and\none or more other accounts managed or advised\nby BlackRock are considered at or about the\nsame time, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Funds and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Funds\nare concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFunds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest\nfor its own account in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may,\nfrom time to time, effect trades on behalf of\nand for the account of the Funds with brokers\nor dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Funds\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses.

Such transactions with\na particular broker-dealer may be conditioned\nupon the broker-dealer's agreement to transact\nat guaranteed price levels in order to reduce\ntransaction costs the Fund would otherwise\nincur as a consequence of settling creation or\nredemption baskets in cash rather than in-\nkind. Following the Fund\u2019s receipt of an order\nto purchase or redeem creation or redemption\nbaskets, to the extent such purchases or\nredemptions consist of a cash portion, the\nFund will enter an order with a broker or\ndealer to purchase or sell the Deposit\nSecurities or Fund Securities, as applicable.\nThe terms of such order may, depending on the\ntiming of the transaction and certain other\nfactors, require the broker or dealer to\nguarantee that the Fund will achieve execution\nof its order at a price at least as favorable\nto the Fund as the Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nDeposit Securities/Fund Securities used for\npurposes of calculating the NAV applied to the\ncreation or redemption transaction giving rise\nto the order (the \u201c Execution Performance\nGuarantee \u201d ). Such orders may be placed with\nthe purchasing or redeeming Authorized\nParticipant (or a broker-dealer affiliated\nwith the Authorized Participant or a third-\nparty broker-dealer engaged through the\nAuthorized Participant) in its capacity as a\nbroker-dealer. The amount payable to the Fund\nin respect of any Execution Performance\nGuarantee will depend on the results achieved\nby the executing firm and will vary depending\non market activity, timing and a variety of\nother factors. The Execution Performance\nGuarantee will apply for any orders executed\nby the Authorized Participant (or an\naffiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer),\neven if the trades have not settled before the\nredemption transaction settles. To ensure that\nan Execution Performance Guarantee will be\nhonored on orders arising from creation\ntransactions executed by an Authorized\nParticipant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated\nbroker-dealer), an Authorized Participant is\nrequired to deposit an amount with the Fund\n(the \u201c Execution Performance Deposit \u201d ). If\nthe broker-dealer executing the order achieves\nexecutions in market transactions at a price\nmore favorable than the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe Deposit Securities, then the Authorized\nParticipant generally may retain the benefit\nof the favorable executions, and the Fund will\nreturn to the Authorized Participant the\nExecution Performance Deposit. If, however,\nthe broker-dealer executing the order is\nunable to achieve executions in market\ntransactions at a price at least equal to the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the securities, the Fund\nretains the portion of the Execution\nPerformance Deposit equal to the full amount\nof the execution shortfall (including any\ntaxes, brokerage commissions or other costs)\nand may require the Authorized Participant to\ndeposit any additional amount required to\ncover the full amount of the actual Execution\nPerformance Guarantee.\n\n77\n\nTo ensure that an Execution Performance\nGuarantee will be honored for brokerage orders\narising from redemption transactions executed\nby an Authorized Participant (or an affiliated\nor unaffiliated broker-dealer) as broker-\ndealer, an Authorized Participant agrees to\npay the shortfall amount (the \u201c Execution\nPerformance Offset \u201d ). If the broker-dealer\nexecuting the order achieves executions in\nmarket transactions at a price more favorable\nthan the Fund\u2019s valuation of the Fund\nSecurities, then the Authorized Participant\ngenerally may retain the benefit of the\nfavorable executions and the Authorized\nParticipant is not called upon to honor the\nExecution Performance Offset. If, however, the\nbroker-dealer is unable to achieve executions\nin market transactions at a price at least\nequal to the Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nsecurities, the Fund will be entitled to the\nportion of the Execution Performance Offset\nequal to the full amount of the execution\nshortfall (including any taxes, brokerage\ncommissions or other costs). The circumstances\nunder which the Execution Performance\nGuarantee will be used and the expected amount\nof any Execution Performance Deposit or\nExecution Performance Offset for the Fund will\nbe disclosed in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time based on the actual experience of\nthe Fund. Additional Information Concerning\nthe Trust Shares. The Trust issues shares of\nbeneficial interests in the funds with no par\nvalue. The Board may designate additional\niShares funds. Each share issued by a fund has\na pro rata interest in the assets of that\nfund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange,\nsubscription or conversion rights and are\nfreely transferable. Each share is entitled to\nparticipate equally in dividends and\ndistributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the relevant fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of such fund on\nliquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Following the creation of the\ninitial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund\nand immediately prior to the commencement of\ntrading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more\nthan 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject\nto the reporting provisions of Section 13 of\nthe 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould consult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff. In accordance with\nthe Trust's current Agreement and Declaration\nof Trust (the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the\nBoard may, without shareholder approval\n(unless such shareholder approval is required\nby the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of 78\n\nTrust provides that the Board will have the\nunrestricted power to alter the number of\nshares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the\nevent of a termination of the Trust or a fund,\nthe Board, in its sole discretion, could\ndetermine to permit the shares to be\nredeemable in aggregations smaller than\nCreation Units or to be individually\nredeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or\na fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash\nor for a combination of cash or securities.\nFurther, in the event of a termination of the\nTrust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might\nelect to pay cash redemptions to all\nshareholders, with an in-kind election for\nshareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Funds. Shares of\neach Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of each\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of each Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with each Fund's\nlaunch, each Fund was seeded through the sale\nof one or more Creation Units by each Fund to\none or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof each Fund or each Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\n\n79\n\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor each Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nEach Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\neach Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund\u2019s NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the applicable Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, the Funds may\nrequire orders to be placed earlier in the\nday. The following table sets forth the number\nof shares of a Fund that constitute a Creation\nUnit for such Fund and the approximate value\nof such Creation Unit as of May 31, 2024:\n                                              \n                       Shares  ApproximateV\u2026  \n  Fund            PerCreation  PerCreationU\u2026  \n                         Unit        (U.S.$)  \n  iShares                                     \n  Environment\u2026        120,000  $2,986,043.28  \n  Aware Real                                  \n  Estate ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Global Clean        100,000  $1,497,080.40  \n  Energy ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Global REIT          50,000  $1,155,045.15  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Internation\u2026                                \n  Developed           100,000  $2,096,168.70  \n  Real                                        \n  Estate ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Internation\u2026                                \n  Select               50,000  $1,479,604.55  \n  Dividend                                    \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of a\nFund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation Unit.\nThe Board reserves the right to declare a\nsplit or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of any Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board. A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\neach Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. Each Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\neach Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of a Fund generally\nconsists of Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent computed as described below.\nTogether, the Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent constitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d\nwhich, when combined with the Fund's portfolio\nsecurities, is designed to generate\nperformance that has a collective investment\nprofile similar to that of the Underlying\nIndex. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum\ninitial and subsequent investment amount for a\nCreation Unit of any Fund. Such Fund Deposit\nis applicable, subject to any adjustments as\ndescribed below, to purchases of Creation\nUnits of shares of the Fund until such time as\nthe next-announced Fund Deposit is made\navailable.\n\n80\n\nThe Cash Component is an amount equal to the\ndifference between the NAV of the shares (per\nCreation Unit) and the \u201c Deposit Amount, \u201d\nwhich is an amount equal to the market value\nof the Deposit Securities, and serves to\ncompensate for any differences between the NAV\nper Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount.\nPayment of any stamp duty or other similar\nfees and expenses payable upon transfer of\nbeneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities\nare the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant purchasing the Creation Unit. Each\nFund generally offers Creation Units partially\nfor cash, but may, in certain circumstances,\noffer Creation Units solely for cash or solely\nin-kind. The identity and number of shares of\nthe Deposit Securities change pursuant to\nchanges in the composition of a Fund's\nportfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and\ncorporate action events are reflected from\ntime to time by BFA with a view to the\ninvestment objective of the Fund. The\ncomposition of the Deposit Securities may also\nchange in response to adjustments to the\nweighting or composition of the component\nsecurities constituting the relevant\nUnderlying Index. The Fund Deposit may also be\nmodified to minimize the Cash Component by\nredistributing the cash to the Deposit\nSecurities portion of the Fund Deposit through\n\u201c systematic rounding. \u201d The rounding\nmethodology \u201c rounds up \u201d position sizes of\nsecurities in the Deposit Securities (which in\nturn reduces the cash portion). However, the\nmethodology limits the maximum allowed\npercentage change in weight and share quantity\nof any given security in the Fund Deposit.\nFund Deposits may also be modified to position\na fund towards a forward index rebalance to\nreflect revisions that account for index\nadditions, deletions, and re-weights. The\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the\nCash Component to replace any Deposit Security\nin certain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit full cash purchases of Creation Units\nof its funds, when partial or full cash\npurchases of Creation Units are available or\nspecified (Creation Units of the Funds are\ngenerally offered partially for cash), they\nwill be effected in essentially the same\nmanner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the\ncase of a partial or full cash purchase, the\nAuthorized Participant must pay the cash\nequivalent of the Deposit Securities it would\notherwise be required to provide through an\nin-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nThe Authorized Participant will also be\nrequired to pay certain transaction fees and\ncharges for cash purchases, as described\nbelow, and, if transacting as broker with the\nFund, may be required to cover certain\nbrokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution\nand price movement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Funds, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith the Funds or one of their service\nproviders that allows such member or\nparticipant to place orders for the purchase\nand redemption of Creation Units is referred\nto as an \u201c Authorized Participant. \u201d All\nshares of the Funds, however created, will be\nentered on the records of DTC in the name of\nCede & Co. for the account of a DTC\nParticipant. Role of the Authorized\nParticipant. Creation Units may be purchased\nonly by or through a member or participant of\na clearing agency registered with the SEC,\nwhich has a written agreement with the Funds\nor one of their service providers that allows\nsuch member or participant to place orders for\nthe purchase and redemption of Creation Units\n(an \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ). Such\nAuthorized Participant will agree, pursuant to\nthe terms of such Authorized Participant\nAgreement and on behalf of itself or any\ninvestor on whose behalf it will act, to\ncertain conditions, including that such\nAuthorized Participant will make available in\nadvance of each purchase of shares an amount\nof cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component,\nonce the NAV of a Creation Unit is next\ndetermined after receipt of the purchase order\nin proper form, together with the transaction\nfees described below. An Authorized\nParticipant, acting on behalf of an investor,\nmay require the investor to enter into an\nagreement with such Authorized Participant\nwith respect to certain matters, including\npayment of the Cash Component.\n\n81\n\nInvestors who are not Authorized Participants\nmust make appropriate arrangements with an\nAuthorized Participant. Investors should be\naware that their particular broker may not be\na DTC Participant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\nAuthorized Participant. As a result, purchase\norders placed through an Authorized\nParticipant may result in additional charges\nto such investor. The Trust does not expect to\nenter into an Authorized Participant Agreement\nwith more than a small number of DTC\nParticipants. A list of current Authorized\nParticipants may be obtained from the\nDistributor. The Distributor has adopted\nguidelines regarding Authorized Participants\u2019\ntransactions in Creation Units that are made\navailable to all Authorized Participants.\nThese guidelines set forth the processes and\nstandards for Authorized Participants to\ntransact with the Distributor and its agents\nin connection with creation and redemption\ntransactions. In addition, the Distributor may\nbe appointed as the proxy of the Authorized\nParticipant and may be granted a power of\nattorney under its Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Purchase Orders. To initiate an\norder for a Creation Unit, an Authorized\nParticipant must submit to the Distributor or\nits agent an irrevocable order to purchase\nshares of a Fund, in proper form, generally\nbefore 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business\nDay to receive that day\u2019s NAV. The Distributor\nor its agent will notify BFA and the custodian\nof such order. The custodian will then provide\nsuch information to any appropriate sub-\ncustodian. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning the delivery of the Fund Deposit are\nset forth in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time. Investors, other than Authorized\nParticipants, are responsible for making\narrangements for a creation request to be made\nthrough an Authorized Participant. The\nDistributor or its agent will provide a list\nof current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFunds, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\napplicable deadline for cash transfers by\ncontacting the operations department of the\nbroker or depositary institution effectuating\nthe transfer of the Cash Component. This\ndeadline is likely to be significantly earlier\nthan the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors\nshould be aware that an Authorized Participant\nmay require orders for purchases of shares\nplaced with it to be in the particular form\nrequired by the individual Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant is\nresponsible for any and all expenses and costs\nincurred by a Fund, including any applicable\ncash amounts, in connection with any purchase\norder. Timing of Submission of Purchase\nOrders. An Authorized Participant must submit\nan irrevocable order to purchase shares of a\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Funds to the Distributor or\nits agent pursuant to procedures set forth in\nthe Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic\nor market disruptions or changes, or telephone\nor other communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. Orders to create\nshares of a Fund that are submitted on the\nBusiness Day immediately preceding a holiday\nor a day (other than a weekend) when the\nequity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market\nare closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as that Fund's\n\u201c Cutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with a\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Funds are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFunds will accept the order, subject to each\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below.\n\n82\n\nOnce a Fund has accepted an order, upon the\nnext determination of the NAV of the shares,\nthe Fund will confirm the issuance of a\nCreation Unit, against receipt of payment, at\nsuch NAV. The Distributor or its agent will\nthen transmit a confirmation of acceptance to\nthe Authorized Participant that placed the\norder. Each Fund reserves the right to reject\nor revoke a creation order transmitted to it\nby the Distributor or its agent provided that\na rejection or revocation of a creation order\ndoes not violate Rule 6c-11 under the\nInvestment Company Act. For example, a Fund\nmay reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent if (i) the order is not in proper form;\n(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the\nshares ordered, would own 80% or more of the\ncurrently outstanding shares of the Fund;\n(iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not\nconform to the identity and number of shares\nspecified, as described above; (iv) acceptance\nof the Deposit Securities is not legally\nrequired or would, in the opinion of counsel,\nbe unlawful; or (v) circumstances outside the\ncontrol of the Fund, the Distributor or its\nagent and BFA make it impracticable to process\npurchase orders. The Distributor or its agent\nshall notify a prospective purchaser of a\nCreation Unit and/or the Authorized\nParticipant acting on behalf of such purchaser\nof its rejection of such order. The Funds,\nState Street, the sub-custodian and the\nDistributor or its agent are under no duty,\nhowever, to give notification of any defects\nor irregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall any of them incur any\nliability for failure to give such\nnotification. Issuance of a Creation Unit.\nExcept as provided herein, a Creation Unit\nwill not be issued until the transfer of good\ntitle to the applicable Fund of the Deposit\nSecurities and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the sub-\ncustodian has confirmed to the custodian that\nthe securities included in the Fund Deposit\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant sub-\ncustodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor\nor its agent and BFA shall be notified of such\ndelivery and the applicable Fund will issue\nand cause the delivery of the Creation Unit.\nCreation Units are generally issued on a \u201c T+2\nbasis \u201d ( i.e. , two Business Days after trade\ndate). However, each Fund reserves the right\nto settle Creation Unit transactions on a\ndifferent basis, if necessary or appropriate\nunder the circumstances and compliant with\napplicable law. These circumstances may\ninclude, among others, accommodating non-U.S.\nmarket holiday schedules and accounting for\ndifferent treatment among non-U.S. and U.S.\nmarkets of dividend record dates and ex-\ndividend dates ( i.e. , the last day the\nholder of a security can sell the security and\nstill receive dividends payable on the\nsecurity). To the extent contemplated by an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement with the\nDistributor, each Fund will issue Creation\nUnits to such Authorized Participant,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the\ncorresponding Fund Deposits have not been\nreceived in part or in whole, in reliance on\nthe undertaking of the Authorized Participant\nto deliver the missing Deposit Securities as\nsoon as possible, which undertaking shall be\nsecured by such Authorized Participant's\ndelivery and maintenance of collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to buy Deposit\nSecurities for the Funds. Such collateral must\nbe delivered no later than the time specified\nby a Fund or its custodian on the contractual\nsettlement date. Information concerning the\nFunds' current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Funds to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Funds of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges. In certain cases,\nAuthorized Participants may create and redeem\nCreation Units on the same trade date and in\nthese instances, the Funds reserve the right\nto settle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by each\nFund and the Fund's determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer, processing and other transaction\ncosts associated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. The standard creation transaction fee\nis charged on each Creation Unit created by an\nAuthorized Participant on the day of the\ntransaction. The standard creation transaction\nfee is generally fixed at the amount shown in\nthe table below regardless of the number of\nCreation Units being purchased, but may be\nreduced by each Fund if transfer and\nprocessing expenses associated with the\ncreation are anticipated to be lower than the\nstated fee. In order to defray transaction\nexpenses for a Fund and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, if a creation\ntransaction consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution and other costs and\nexpenses related to the execution of trades\nresulting from such transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction\n\n83\n\ncosts based on historical data or other\ninputs, at BlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may\ninclude part or all of the spread between the\nexpected bid and offer side of the market and\nanticipated market impact). However, a Fund is\nnot obligated to trade identical securities to\nthe securities identified by BlackRock in\nestimating these transaction and other costs\nand expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or\nan affiliate may determine in its discretion\nto deviate from the regular charge, subject to\nthe maximum amounts shown below. Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Deposit Securities to the\nFunds. Certain fees/costs associated with\ncreation transactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\nacquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for\nsuch services. The following table sets forth\neach Fund's standard creation transaction fees\nand maximum additional charge (as described\nabove):\n                                              \n                     Standard  Maximum        \n  Fund          CreationTran\u2026  AdditionalCh\u2026  \n                          Fee                 \n  iShares                                     \n  Environment\u2026                                \n  Aware Real           $4,700  7.0%           \n  Estate                                      \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Global Clean            300  7.0%           \n  Energy ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Global REIT           2,700  7.0%           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Internation\u2026                                \n  Developed             4,000  7.0%           \n  Real Estate                                 \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Internation\u2026          2,000  7.0%           \n  Select                                      \n  Dividend ETF                                \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit. If a purchase consists of a\ncash portion and each Fund places a brokerage\ntransaction to purchase portfolio securities\nwith the Authorized Participant (or an\naffiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), the\nAuthorized Participant may be required, in its\ncapacity as broker-dealer with respect to that\ntransaction, to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution, and price\nmovement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nRedemption of Creation Units. Shares of a Fund\nmay be redeemed by Authorized Participants\nonly in Creation Units at their NAV next\ndetermined after receipt of a redemption\nrequest in proper form by the Distributor or\nits agent and only on a Business Day. The\nFunds will not redeem shares in amounts less\nthan Creation Units. There can be no\nassurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the secondary market\nat any time to permit assembly of a Creation\nUnit. Investors should expect to incur\nbrokerage and other costs in connection with\nassembling a sufficient number of shares to\nconstitute a Creation Unit that could be\nredeemed by an Authorized Participant.\nBeneficial owners also may sell shares in the\nsecondary market. Each Fund generally redeems\nCreation Units partially for cash. However,\nthe Fund reserves the right to distribute\nsecurities and other portfolio instruments in-\nkind as payment for Creation Units being\nredeemed. Please see the Cash Redemption\nMethod section below and the following\ndiscussion summarizing the in-kind method for\nfurther information on redeeming Creation\nUnits of the Funds. Each Fund publishes the\ndesignated portfolio of securities (including\nany portion of such securities for which cash\nmay be substituted) that will be applicable to\nredemption requests received in proper form\n(as defined below) on that day ( \u201c Fund\nSecurities \u201d or \u201c Redemption Basket \u201d ), and\nan amount of cash (the \u201c Cash Amount, \u201d as\ndescribed below) in order to effect\nredemptions of Creation Units of a Fund. Such\nFund Securities and Cash Amount will remain in\neffect until such time as the next announced\ncomposition of the Fund Securities and Cash\nAmount is made available. The Fund Securities\nand Cash Amount are subject to possible\namendment or correction. Fund Securities\nreceived on redemption may not be identical to\nDeposit Securities that are applicable to\ncreations of Creation Units. Procedures and\nrequirements governing redemption transactions\nare set forth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants and may change from time to time.\nIf redemptions are not paid in cash, the\nredemption proceeds for a Creation Unit\ngenerally consist of Fund Securities, plus the\nCash Amount, which is an amount equal to the\ndifference between the NAV of the shares being\nredeemed, as next determined after the receipt\nof a redemption request in proper form, and\nthe value of Fund Securities, less a\nredemption transaction fee (as described\nbelow).\n\n84\n\nThe Trust may, in its sole discretion,\nsubstitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to\nreplace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally\nredeems Creation Units partially for cash.\nEach Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide\nsuch redeeming Authorized Participant a\nportfolio of securities that differs from the\nexact composition of the Fund Securities, but\ndoes not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket\nmay also be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index rebalance to reflect revisions\nthat account for index additions, deletions,\nand re-weights. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\nfull cash redemptions of Creation Units of its\nfunds, when partial or full cash redemptions\nof Creation Units are available or specified\n(Creation Units of the Funds are generally\nredeemed partially for cash or where the\nmarket for individual securities does not\npermit in-kind redemption), to the extent that\ncash redemptions are offered, they will be\neffected in essentially the same manner as in-\nkind redemptions thereof. In the case of\npartial or full cash redemption, the\nAuthorized Participant receives the cash\nequivalent of the Fund Securities and other\ninstruments it would otherwise receive through\nan in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash\nAmount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer. The\nAuthorized Participant will also be required\nto pay certain transaction fees and charges\nfor cash redemptions, as described below, and,\nif transacting as broker with the Fund, may be\nrequired to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution and price movement\ncosts through an Execution Performance\nGuarantee, as described in the Brokerage\nTransactions section of this SAI. Cash\nredemption proceeds will be paid to the\nAuthorized Participant redeeming shares as\nsoon as practicable after the date of\nredemption or within seven calendar days\nthereafter. If a Fund settles redemptions on a\ncash basis and an Authorized Participant has\nentered into an Execution Performance\nGuarantee, but the Authorized Participant is\nunable, as determined by BFA in its sole\ndiscretion, to execute the market transactions\nthat are the subject of the Execution\nPerformance Guarantee due to an extended\nmarket holiday that goes over seven calendar\ndays or in certain other situations where all\nor a portion of the transactions are unable to\nbe executed within seven calendar days, then\nthe Fund may pay the full amount of the\nredemption order (or the remaining amount of\nthe redemption order based on the unexecuted\nportion of the transaction) within the\noriginal seven calendar day period by using\nthe Fund\u2019s overdraft facility, line of credit\nor cash on hand. The Authorized Participant\n(or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-\ndealer), acting on an agency basis, will\nsubsequently enter into one or more separate\nmarket transactions when the markets reopen or\nthe trades are otherwise able to be executed\nthrough which a Fund sells the Fund Securities\n(or the remaining unsold Fund Securities)\nsubject to a guaranteed sales price. If the\nAuthorized Participant (or an affiliated or\nunaffiliated broker-dealer) achieves\nexecutions in market transactions at a price\nmore favorable than a Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nFund Securities as of the NAV calculation\napplicable on the date of the redemption, then\nthe Authorized Participant generally may\nretain the excess transaction proceeds.\nSpecifically, if the Authorized Participant is\nunable to achieve executions in market\ntransactions at a price at least equal to the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the Fund Securities as of\nthe NAV calculation applicable on the date of\nthe redemption, then the Authorized\nParticipant is generally required to make the\napplicable shortfall payment to the Fund. In\naddition, if transacting as broker with a Fund\nin a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the Authorized\nParticipant may be required to cover foreign\nexchange costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI. If\nthe foreign exchange transaction associated\nwith the applicable security trades can only\noccur upon the settlement of a security trade\nand such trades are unable, as determined by\nBFA in its sole discretion, to be settled by\nthe seventh calendar day after receipt of the\nAuthorized Participant's redemption order,\nthen a Fund may pay within the original seven\ncalendar day period the amount due in respect\nof the redemption order based on the foreign\nexchange rate as of the date of the redemption\norder by using the Fund\u2019s overdraft facility,\nline of credit or cash on hand (in addition to\nany sales proceeds from the executed portion\nof the original brokerage order) and\nsubsequently enter into one or more separate\n\n85\n\nforeign exchange transactions with the\nAuthorized Participant (or a broker-dealer\naffiliate of the Authorized Participant or a\nthird-party broker-dealer engaged through the\nAuthorized Participant), acting on an agency\nbasis, and be subject to a guaranteed sales\nprice. If the Authorized Participant achieves\nexecution of the foreign exchange transactions\nat a price more favorable than the foreign\nexchange rate as of the NAV calculation\napplicable on the date of the redemption, then\nthe Authorized Participant generally may\nretain the excess transaction proceeds. If the\nAuthorized Participant is unable to achieve\nexecution of the foreign exchange transactions\nat a price at least equal to the foreign\nexchange rate as of the NAV calculation\napplicable on the date of the redemption, then\nthe Authorized Participant is required to make\nthe applicable shortfall payment to the Fund.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\nA standard redemption transaction fee is\nimposed to offset transfer, processing and\nother transaction costs that may be incurred\nby the relevant Fund. The standard redemption\ntransaction fee is charged on each Creation\nUnit redeemed by an Authorized Participant on\nthe day of the transaction. The standard\nredemption transaction fee is generally fixed\nat the amount shown in the table below\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing redeemed, but may be reduced by the Fund\nif transfer and processing expenses associated\nwith the redemption are anticipated to be\nlower than the stated fee. In order to defray\ntransaction expenses for a Fund and protect\nagainst possible shareholder dilution, if a\nredemption transaction consists solely or\npartially of cash, the Authorized Participant\nmay also be required to cover (up to the\nmaximum amount shown below) certain brokerage,\ntax, foreign exchange, execution and other\ncosts and expenses related to the execution of\ntrades resulting from such transaction (which\nmay, in certain instances, be based on a good\nfaith estimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread between the expected bid\nand offer side of the market and anticipated\nmarket impact). However, a Fund is not\nobligated to trade identical securities to the\nsecurities identified by BlackRock in\nestimating these transaction and other costs\nand expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or\nan affiliate may determine in its discretion\nto deviate from the regular charge, subject to\nthe maximum amounts shown below. Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Fund Securities from the Fund\nto their account on their order. Certain\nfees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\ndispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee\nfor such services. The following table sets\nforth each Fund's standard redemption\ntransaction fees and maximum additional charge\n(as described above):\n                                              \n                     Standard  Maximum        \n  Fund          RedemptionTr\u2026  AdditionalCh\u2026  \n                          Fee                 \n  iShares                                     \n  Environment\u2026                                \n  Aware Real           $4,700  2.0%           \n  Estate                                      \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Global Clean            300  2.0%           \n  Energy ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Global REIT           2,700  2.0%           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Internation\u2026                                \n  Developed             4,000  2.0%           \n  Real                                        \n  Estate ETF                                  \n  iShares                                     \n  Internation\u2026          2,000  2.0%           \n  Select                                      \n  Dividend ETF                                \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\nredemption transaction fee. If a redemption\nconsists of a cash portion and a Fund places a\nbrokerage transaction to sell portfolio\nsecurities with the Authorized Participant (or\nan affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer),\nthe Authorized Participant may be required, in\nits capacity as broker-dealer with respect to\nthat transaction, to cover certain brokerage,\ntax, foreign exchange, execution, and price\nmovement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nPlacement of Redemption Orders. Redemption\nrequests for Creation Units of the Funds must\nbe submitted to the Distributor or its agent\nby or through an Authorized Participant. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable request to redeem shares of a Fund\ngenerally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on\nany Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, a Fund may require\norders to redeem Creation\n\n86\n\nUnits to be placed earlier that day.\nInvestors, other than Authorized Participants,\nare responsible for making arrangements for a\nredemption request to be made through an\nAuthorized Participant. The Distributor or its\nagent will provide a list of current\nAuthorized Participants upon request. The\nAuthorized Participant must transmit the\nrequest for redemption in the form required by\nthe Funds to the Distributor or its agent in\naccordance with procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Investors\nshould be aware that their particular broker\nmay not have executed an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and that, therefore,\nrequests to redeem Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\nAuthorized Participant who has executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. At any time,\nonly a limited number of broker-dealers will\nhave an Authorized Participant Agreement in\neffect. Investors making a redemption request\nshould be aware that such request must be in\nthe form specified by such Authorized\nParticipant. Investors making a request to\nredeem Creation Units should allow sufficient\ntime to permit proper submission of the\nrequest by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Funds'\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the applicable\nFund is received by the Distributor or its\nagent from the Authorized Participant on\nbehalf of itself or another redeeming investor\nwithin the time periods specified above; and\n(iii) all other procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement are properly\nfollowed. Upon receiving a redemption request,\nthe Distributor or its agent shall notify the\napplicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent\nof such redemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds are generally made within two\nBusiness Days ( i.e ., \u201c T+2 \u201d ). However,\neach Fund reserves the right to settle\nredemption transactions on a different basis,\nif necessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. These circumstances may include, among\nothers, accommodating non-U.S. market holiday\nschedules and accounting for different\ntreatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of\ndividend record dates and dividend ex-dates (\ni.e. , the last date the holder of a security\ncan sell the security and still receive\ndividends payable on the security sold). If\nneither the Authorized Participant nor the\nBeneficial Owner on whose behalf the\nAuthorized Participant is acting has\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nFund Securities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in\nits discretion exercise its option to redeem\nsuch shares in cash, and the Beneficial Owner\nwill be required to receive its redemption\nproceeds in cash. In such case, the investor\nwill receive a cash payment equal to the net\nasset value of its shares based on the NAV of\nthe relevant Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charges specified above to offset\nthe Fund's brokerage and other transaction\ncosts associated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and each Fund (whether or not it\notherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves\nthe right to redeem Creation Units for cash to\nthe extent that the Fund cannot lawfully\ndeliver specific Fund Securities upon\nredemptions or cannot do so without first\nregistering the Fund Securities under such\nlaws. Although the Trust does not ordinarily\npermit cash redemptions of Creation Units\n(except that, as noted above, Creation Units\nof the Funds generally will be redeemed\npartially for cash), in the event that cash\nredemptions are permitted or required by the\nTrust, proceeds will be paid to the Authorized\nParticipant redeeming shares as soon as\npracticable after the date of redemption\n(within seven calendar days thereafter). If a\nFund includes a foreign investment in its\nbasket, and if a local market holiday, or\nseries of consecutive holidays, or the\nextended delivery cycles for transferring\nforeign investments to redeeming\n\n87\n\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of the foreign investment in response\nto a redemption request, the Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if the Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant's\nagreement with the Distributor or its agent,\nin the event an Authorized Participant has\nsubmitted a redemption request in proper form\nbut is unable to transfer all or part of the\nCreation Unit to be redeemed to the Funds, at\nor prior to the time specified by the Funds or\nits custodian on the Business Day after the\ndate of submission of such redemption request,\nthe Distributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Funds or its custodian\non the Business Day after the date of\nsubmission of such redemption request and\nshall be held by State Street and marked-to-\nmarket daily. The fees of State Street and any\nsub-custodians in respect of the delivery,\nmaintenance and redelivery of the collateral\nshall be payable by the Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement permits the Funds to acquire shares\nof the Funds at any time and subjects the\nAuthorized Participant to liability for any\nshortfall between the aggregate of the cost to\nthe Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the\nvalue of the Cash Amount, and the value of the\ncollateral together with liability for related\nbrokerage and other charges. Because the\nPortfolio Securities of the Funds may trade on\nexchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange\nis closed or are otherwise not Business Days\nfor the Funds, shareholders may not be able to\nredeem their shares of the Funds or purchase\nor sell shares of the Funds on the Listing\nExchange on days when the NAV of the Funds\ncould be significantly affected by events in\nthe relevant non-U.S. markets. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of\npayment postponed with respect to any Fund:\n(i) for any period during which the Listing\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Listing\nExchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for\nany period during which an emergency exists as\na result of which disposal of the shares of\nthe Fund's portfolio securities or\ndetermination of its NAV is not reasonably\npracticable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and each Fund may accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\na Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. Each Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of a Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of a Fund may be taken into\naccount. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for each Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Funds, as set forth in each\nFund's policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets.\n\n88\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of a Fund.\nThis summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to a Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Regulated Investment\nCompany Qualifications. Each Fund intends to\nqualify for treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of each\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of each\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of each Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of each\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. A Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests\nand does not timely cure the failure, that\nFund will be taxed in the same manner as an\nordinary corporation and distributions to its\nshareholders will not be deductible by that\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. A\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, a Fund must\ndistribute to its shareholders at least the\nsum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than the\nexcess of its net realized long-term capital\ngain over its net realized short-term capital\nloss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and\n(ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the\ntaxable year. A Fund will be subject to income\ntax at regular corporate rates on any taxable\nincome or gains that it does not distribute to\nits shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify\nfor any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet\nthe distribution requirement, all of its\ntaxable income will be subject to tax at\nregular corporate income tax rates without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand such distributions generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends\nto the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although\neach Fund intends to distribute substantially\nall of its net investment income and its\ncapital gains for each taxable year, a Fund\nmay decide to retain a portion of its income\nor gains if the Fund determines that doing so\nis in the interest of its shareholders. Each\nFund will be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to\nqualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out\nits earnings and profits accumulated in that\nyear in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a\nFund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two\n\n89\n\ntaxable years, the Fund may be required to\nrecognize any net built-in gains with respect\nto certain of its assets ( i.e., the excess of\nthe aggregate gains, including items of\nincome, over aggregate losses that would have\nbeen realized with respect to such assets if\nthe Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies\nas a RIC in a subsequent year. Excise Tax. A\nFund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on\ncertain undistributed income if it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders in each\ncalendar year at least 98% of its ordinary\nincome for the calendar year plus at least\n98.2% of its capital gain net income for the\n12 months ended October 31 of such year. For\nthis purpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by a Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. Each Fund intends to declare\nand distribute dividends and distributions in\nthe amounts and at the times necessary to\navoid the application of this 4% excise tax.\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards. Net capital\nloss carryforwards may be applied against any\nnet realized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that a Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. The following\nFunds had net capital loss carryforwards, as\nset forth in the table below, as of April 30,\n2024, the tax year-end for the Funds listed:\n                                              \n  Fund                   Non-ExpiringCapital  \n                            LossCarryforward  \n  iShares                                     \n  Environmentally                    $20,336  \n  Aware RealEstate                            \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Global               2,158,580,223  \n  Clean Energy ETF                            \n  iShares Global REIT            176,009,729  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  International                  100,302,431  \n  Developed                                   \n  RealEstate ETF                              \n  iShares                                     \n  International                1,338,068,550  \n  Select DividendETF                          \n                                              \nTaxation of U.S. Shareholders. Dividends and\nother distributions by a Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by a Fund in\nOctober, November or December of any calendar\nyear and payable to shareholders of record on\na specified date in such a month shall be\ndeemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. Each\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if a Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\na Fund reports as capital gains dividends are\ntaxable as long-term capital gains, whether\npaid in cash or in shares and regardless of\nhow long a shareholder has held shares of the\nFund.\n\n90\n\nAll other dividends of a Fund (including\ndividends from short-term capital gains) from\nits current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits ( \u201c regular dividends \u201d ) are\ngenerally subject to tax as ordinary income,\nsubject to the discussion of qualified\ndividend income below. Long-term capital gains\nare eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of\n15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders,\ndepending on whether their income exceeds\ncertain threshold amounts. If an individual\nreceives a regular dividend qualifying for the\nlong-term capital gains rates and such\ndividend constitutes an \u201c extraordinary\ndividend, \u201d and the individual subsequently\nrecognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of\nstock in respect of which the extraordinary\ndividend was paid, then the loss will be long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of such\nextraordinary dividend. An \u201c extraordinary\ndividend \u201d on common stock for this purpose is\ngenerally a dividend (i) in an amount greater\nthan or equal to 10% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax\nbasis (or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount\ngreater than 20% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax basis\n(or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin a 365-day period. Distributions in\nexcess of a Fund\u2019s current and accumulated\nearnings and profits will, as to each\nshareholder, be treated as a tax-free return\nof capital to the extent of a shareholder\u2019s\nbasis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital\ngain thereafter (if the shareholder holds\nshares of the Fund as capital assets).\nDistributions in excess of the Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but not in excess\nof the Fund\u2019s earnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will not\nconstitute nontaxable returns of capital.\nShareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on net investment\nincome, including, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates and trusts.\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution may nevertheless be\ntaxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of\nrecord of any security on the record date for\nany dividends payable with respect to such\nsecurity, such dividends will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income not as of the date\nreceived but as of the later of (a) the date\nsuch security became ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividends ( i.e. , the date on which a\nbuyer of the security would not be entitled to\nreceive the declared, but unpaid, dividends);\nor (b) the date the Fund acquired such\nsecurity. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its\nincome distribution requirements, a Fund may\nbe required to pay dividends based on\nanticipated earnings, and shareholders may\nreceive dividends in an earlier year than\nwould otherwise be the case. In certain\nsituations, a Fund may, for a taxable year,\ndefer all or a portion of its net capital loss\n(or if there is no net capital loss, then any\nnet long-term or short-term capital loss)\nrealized after October and its late-year\nordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the\nexcess of post-October foreign currency and\npassive foreign investment company ( \u201c PFIC \u201d\n) losses over post-October foreign currency\nand PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-\nDecember ordinary losses over post-December\nordinary income) until the next taxable year\nin computing its investment company taxable\nincome and net capital gain, which will defer\nthe recognition of such realized losses. Such\ndeferrals and other rules regarding gains and\nlosses realized after October (or December)\nmay affect the tax character of shareholder\ndistributions. Sales of Shares. Upon the sale\nor exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder\nwill realize a taxable gain or loss equal to\nthe difference between the amount realized and\nthe shareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund.\nA redemption of shares by a Fund will be\ntreated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain\nor loss will be treated as capital gain or\nloss if the shares are capital assets in the\nshareholder\u2019s hands and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor more than one year and short-term capital\ngain or loss if the shares are held for one\nyear or less. Any loss realized on a sale or\nexchange will be disallowed to the extent the\nshares disposed of are replaced, including\nreplacement through the reinvesting of\ndividends or capital gains distributions, or\nby an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares.\n\n91\n\nIf a shareholder incurs a sales charge in\nacquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those\nshares within 90 days and then, on or before\nJanuary 31 of the following calendar year,\nacquires shares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, a Fund will be required to withhold at\na 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such\namounts withheld from any distributions paid\nto a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability. Sections 351 and 362. The Trust, on\nbehalf of each Fund, has the right to reject\nan order for a purchase of shares of the Fund\nif the purchaser (or group of purchasers)\nwould, upon obtaining the shares so ordered,\nown 80% or more of the outstanding shares of a\ngiven Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351\nand 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that\nFund would have a basis in the securities\ndifferent from the market value of such\nsecurities on the date of deposit. If a Fund\u2019s\nbasis in such securities on the date of\ndeposit was less than market value on such\ndate, the Fund, upon disposition of the\nsecurities, would recognize more taxable gain\nor less taxable loss than if its basis in the\nsecurities had been equal to market value. It\nis not anticipated that the Trust will\nexercise the right of rejection except in a\ncase where the Trust determines that accepting\nthe order could result in material adverse tax\nconsequences to a Fund or its shareholders.\nThe Trust also has the right to require\ninformation necessary to determine beneficial\nshare ownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. Taxation of Certain\nDerivatives. A Fund\u2019s transactions in zero\ncoupon securities, non-U.S. currencies,\nforward contracts, options and futures\ncontracts (including options and futures\ncontracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the\nextent permitted, will be subject to special\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code\n(including provisions relating to \u201c hedging\ntransactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d ) that, among\nother consequences, may affect the character\nof gains and losses realized by the Fund (\ni.e. , may affect whether gains or losses are\nordinary or capital), accelerate recognition\nof income to the Fund and defer Fund losses.\nThese rules could therefore affect the\ncharacter, amount and timing of distributions\nto shareholders. These provisions also (a)\nwill require a Fund to mark-to-market certain\ntypes of the positions in its portfolio ( i.e.\n, treat them as if they were closed out at the\nend of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to\nrecognize income without receiving cash with\nwhich to pay dividends or make distributions\nin amounts necessary to satisfy the\ndistribution requirements for avoiding income\nand excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its\ntransactions, will make the appropriate tax\nelections and will make the appropriate\nentries in its books and records when it\nacquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S.\ncurrency, forward contract, option, futures\ncontract or hedged investment in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and prevent\ndisqualification of a Fund as a RIC. A Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in so-called \u201c Section 1256\ncontracts, \u201d such as regulated futures\ncontracts, most non-U.S. currency forward\ncontracts traded in the interbank market and\noptions on most security indexes, are subject\nto special tax rules. All Section 1256\ncontracts held by a Fund at the end of its\ntaxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in a\nFund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by a Fund from positions in Section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by a Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, a Fund may make\nor receive periodic net payments. A Fund may\nalso make or receive a payment when a swap is\nterminated prior to maturity through an\nassignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if a Fund has been a party to the swap\nfor more than one year). With respect to\ncertain types of swaps, a Fund may be required\nto currently recognize income or loss with\nrespect to future payments on such swaps or\nmay elect under certain circumstances to mark\nsuch swaps to market annually for tax purposes\nas ordinary income or loss.\n\n92\n\nQualified Dividend Income. Distributions by a\nFund of investment company taxable income\n(including any short-term capital gains),\nwhether received in cash or shares, will be\ntaxable either as ordinary income or as\nqualified dividend income, which is eligible\nto be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to\nthe extent a Fund receives qualified dividend\nincome on the securities it holds and a Fund\nreports the distribution as qualified dividend\nincome. Qualified dividend income is, in\ngeneral, dividend income from taxable U.S.\ncorporations (but generally not from U.S.\nREITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (\ne.g. , non-U.S. corporations that are not\nPFICs and which are incorporated in a\npossession of the U.S. or in certain countries\nwith a comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S.,\nor the stock of which is readily tradable on\nan established securities market in the U.S.\n(where the dividends are paid with respect to\nsuch stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the\nU.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax\ntreaties with the following countries:\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados,\nBelgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China (but\nnot with Hong Kong, which is treated as a\nseparate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes),\nCyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt,\nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\nRomania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South\nAfrica, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago,\nTunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and\nVenezuela. Substitute payments received by a\nFund for securities lent out by a Fund will\nnot be qualified dividend income. A dividend\nfrom a Fund will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income to the extent that: (i) the\nshareholder has not held the shares on which\nthe dividend was paid for 61 days during the\n121-day period that begins on the date that is\n60 days before the date on which the shares\nbecome ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe securities it holds that paid the\ndividends distributed to the shareholder (or,\nin the case of certain preferred stocks, the\nholding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) a Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a\nFund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated\nas qualified dividend income only to the\nextent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by a Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by a Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by a Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify\nfor the U.S. federal dividends received\ndeduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum\nholding period during the 90-day period that\nbegins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or\n91-day minimum holding period during the 180\nperiod beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend\ndate for certain preference dividends) during\nwhich risk of loss may not be diminished is\nrequired for the applicable shares, at both\nthe Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend\nto be eligible for the dividends received\ndeduction. Restrictions may apply if\nindebtedness, including a short sale, is\nattributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Funds\nserve to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by\ntheir tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a\nFund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-\nfinanced property in the hands of the tax-\nexempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by a Fund\nfrom REITs, real estate mortgage investment\nconduits, taxable mortgage pools or other\ninvestments may cause the Fund to report some\nor all of its distributions as \u201c excess\ninclusion income. \u201d To Fund shareholders, such\nexcess inclusion income may: (i) constitute\ntaxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders\nwho would otherwise be tax-exempt such as\nindividual retirement accounts, 401(k)\naccounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and\ncertain charitable entities; (ii) not be\noffset by otherwise allowable deductions for\ntax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for\nreduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S.\nshareholders even from tax treaty countries;\nand (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax\nif certain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust.\n\n93\n\nA Fund tries to avoid investing in REITs that\nare expected to generate excess inclusion\nincome, but a Fund may not always be\nsuccessful in doing so. Because information\nabout a REIT\u2019s investments may be inadequate\nor inaccurate, or because a REIT may change\nits investment program, a Fund may not be\nsuccessful in avoiding the consequences\ndescribed above. Avoidance of investments in\nREITs that generate excess inclusion income\nmay require a Fund to forego otherwise\nattractive investment opportunities. Non-U.S.\nInvestments. Under Section 988 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, gains or losses attributable to\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the\ntime a Fund accrues income or receivables or\nexpenses or other liabilities denominated in a\nnon-U.S. currency and the time a Fund actually\ncollects such income or pays such liabilities\nare generally treated as ordinary income or\nordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses)\nrealized on debt instruments will be treated\nas Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent\nattributable to changes in exchange rates\nbetween the U.S. dollar and the currencies in\nwhich the instruments are denominated.\nSimilarly, gains or losses on non-U.S.\ncurrency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts\nand certain non-U.S. currency options or\nfutures contracts denominated in non-U.S.\ncurrency, to the extent attributable to\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the\nacquisition and disposition dates, are also\ntreated as ordinary income or loss unless a\nFund was to elect otherwise. Each Fund may be\nsubject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at\nthe source. Each Fund, if permitted to do so,\nmay elect to \u201c pass through \u201d to its investors\nthe amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by\nthe Fund provided that the Fund held the\nsecurity on the dividend settlement date and\nfor at least 15 additional days immediately\nbefore and/or thereafter, with the result that\neach investor with respect to shares of the\nFund held for a minimum 16-day holding period\nat the time of deemed distribution will (i)\ninclude in gross income, even though not\nactually received, the investor\u2019s pro rata\nshare of the Fund\u2019s non-U.S. income taxes, and\n(ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S.\ntaxable income, but only for investors who\nitemize their deductions on their personal tax\nreturns) or credit (in calculating U.S.\nfederal income tax) the investor\u2019s pro rata\nshare of the Fund\u2019s non-U.S. income taxes.\nWithholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S.\nsecurities while such securities are lent out\nby the Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax\ncredit pass through. Taxes not \u201c passed\nthrough \u201d for tax purposes will not be\navailable to shareholders for foreign tax\ncredit purposes. A non-U.S. person invested in\na Fund in a year that the Fund elects to \u201c\npass through \u201d its non-U.S. taxes may be\ntreated as receiving additional dividend\nincome subject to U.S. withholding tax. A\nnon-U.S. tax credit may not exceed the\ninvestor\u2019s U.S. federal income tax otherwise\npayable with respect to the investor\u2019s\nnon-U.S. source income. For this purpose,\nshareholders must treat as non-U.S. source\ngross income (i) their proportionate shares of\nnon-U.S. taxes paid by a Fund and (ii) the\nportion of any dividend paid by the Fund that\nrepresents income derived from non-U.S.\nsources; the Fund\u2019s gain from the sale of\nsecurities will generally be treated as\nU.S.-source income. Certain limitations will\nbe imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S.\ntax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares\nare loaned pursuant to securities lending\narrangements, you may lose the ability to use\nany non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a\nFund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while\nthe shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\nwith respect to shares of a Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. Passive Foreign Investment Companies.\nIf a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on a\nportion of any \u201c excess distribution \u201d or gain\nfrom the disposition of such shares even if\nsuch income is distributed as a taxable\ndividend by the Fund to its shareholders.\nAdditional charges in the nature of interest\nmay be imposed on the Fund in respect of\ndeferred taxes arising from such distributions\nor gains. If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC\nand elect to treat the PFIC as a \u201c qualified\nelecting fund \u201d under the Internal Revenue\nCode, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, a\nFund might be required to include in income\neach year a portion of the ordinary earnings\nand net capital gains of the qualified\nelecting fund, even if not distributed to a\nFund, and such amounts would be subject to the\n90% and excise tax distribution requirements\ndescribed above. In order to make this\nelection, a Fund would be required to obtain\ncertain annual information from the PFICs in\nwhich it invests, which may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain. Alternatively, a Fund\nmay make a mark-to-market election that would\nresult in a Fund being treated as if it had\nsold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end\nof each year. In such case, a Fund would\nreport any such gains as ordinary income and\nwould deduct any such losses as ordinary\nlosses to the extent of previously recognized\ngains. The election must be made separately\nfor each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made,\nwould be effective for all subsequent taxable\nyears, unless revoked with the consent of the\nIRS. By making the election, a Fund could\npotentially ameliorate the adverse tax\nconsequences with respect to its ownership of\nshares in a PFIC, but in any particular year\nmay be required to recognize\n\n94\n\nincome in excess of the distributions it\nreceives from PFICs and its proceeds from\ndispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may have to\ndistribute this \u201c phantom \u201d income and gain to\nsatisfy the 90% distribution requirement and\nto avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax. Each\nFund will make the appropriate tax elections,\nif possible, and take any additional steps\nthat are necessary to mitigate the effects of\nthese rules. Reporting. If a shareholder\nrecognizes a loss with respect to a Fund\u2019s\nshares of $2 million or more for an individual\nshareholder or $10 million or more for a\ncorporate shareholder, the shareholder must\nfile with the IRS a disclosure statement on\nIRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of\nportfolio securities are in many cases\nexempted from this reporting requirement, but\nunder current guidance, shareholders of a RIC\nare not exempted. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer\u2019s treatment of the loss is proper.\nShareholders should consult their tax advisors\nto determine the applicability of these\nregulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances. Other Taxes. Dividends,\ndistributions and redemption proceeds may also\nbe subject to additional state, local and\nnon-U.S. taxes depending on each shareholder\u2019s\nparticular situation. Taxation of Non-U.S.\nShareholders. Dividends paid by a Fund to\nnon-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to\nwithholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced\nrate specified by an applicable income tax\ntreaty to the extent derived from investment\nincome and short-term capital gains. Dividends\npaid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or\nlong-term capital gains are generally not\nsubject to such withholding tax. In order to\nobtain a reduced rate of withholding, a\nnon-U.S. shareholder will be required to\nprovide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to\nbenefits under a treaty. The withholding tax\ndoes not apply to regular dividends paid to a\nnon-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form\nW-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are\neffectively connected with the non-U.S.\nshareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business\nwithin the U.S. Instead, the effectively\nconnected dividends will be subject to regular\nU.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder\nwere a U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S.\ncorporation receiving effectively connected\ndividends may also be subject to additional \u201c\nbranch profits tax \u201d imposed at a rate of 30%\n(or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS\nForm W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be\nsubject to backup withholding at the\nappropriate rate. Properly-reported dividends\nare generally exempt from U.S. federal\nwithholding tax where they (i) are paid in\nrespect of a Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net interest\nincome \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S. source\ninterest income, other than certain contingent\ninterest and interest from obligations of a\ncorporation or partnership in which the Fund\nis at least a 10% shareholder or partner,\nreduced by expenses that are allocable to such\nincome) or (ii) are paid in respect of the\nFund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term capital gains \u201d\n(generally, the excess of the Fund\u2019s net\nshort-term capital gain over the Fund\u2019s long-\nterm capital loss for such taxable year).\nHowever, depending on its circumstances, a\nFund may report all, some or none of its\npotentially eligible dividends as such\nqualified net interest income or as qualified\nshort-term capital gains and/or treat such\ndividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible\nfor this exemption from withholding. In order\nto qualify for this exemption from\nwithholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will need\nto comply with applicable certification\nrequirements relating to its non-U.S. status\n(including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form).\nIn the case of shares held through an\nintermediary, the intermediary may withhold\neven if a Fund reports the payment as\nqualified net interest income or qualified\nshort-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders\nshould contact their intermediaries with\nrespect to the application of these rules to\ntheir accounts. Special rules may apply to a\nforeign shareholder receiving a Fund\ndistribution if at least 50% of the Fund's\nassets consist of interests in U.S. real\nproperty interests, including certain REITs\nand U.S. real property holding corporations\n(as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and\nTreasury regulations). Fund distributions that\nare attributable to gain from the disposition\nof a U.S. real property interest will be\ntaxable as ordinary dividends and subject to\nwithholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if\nthe foreign shareholder held no more than 5%\nof the Fund's shares at any time during the\none-year period ending on the date of the\ndistribution. If the foreign shareholder held\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares, the\ndistribution would be treated as income\neffectively connected with a trade or business\nwithin the U.S. and the foreign shareholder\nwould be subject to withholding tax at a rate\nof 21% and would generally be required to file\na U.S. federal income tax return. Similar\nconsequences would generally apply to a\nforeign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund\nshares unless the Fund is domestically\ncontrolled (meaning that more than 50% of the\nvalue of the Fund's shares is held by U.S.\nshareholders) or the foreign shareholder owns\nno more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any\ntime during the five-year period ending on the\ndate of sale. Finally, a domestically\ncontrolled Fund may be required to recognize a\nportion of its gain on the in-kind\ndistribution of\n\n95\n\ncertain U.S. real property interests.\nShareholders that are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities are urged to consult their\nown tax advisors concerning the particular tax\nconsequences to them of an investment in the\nFund. A foreign shareholder also may be\nsubject to certain \u201c wash sale \u201d rules to\nprevent the avoidance of the tax filing and\npayment obligations discussed above through\nthe sale and repurchase of Fund shares.\nShareholders that are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities are urged to consult their\nown tax advisors concerning the particular tax\nconsequences to them of an investment in a\nFund. Separately, a 30% withholding tax is\ncurrently imposed on U.S.-source dividends,\ninterest and other income items paid to: (i)\nforeign financial institutions, including\nnon-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree\nto collect and disclose to the IRS information\nregarding their direct and indirect U.S.\naccount holders; and (ii) certain other\nforeign entities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. Shares of a Fund held by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder at death will be\nconsidered situated within the U.S. and\nsubject to the U.S. estate tax. The foregoing\ndiscussion is a summary of certain material\nU.S. federal income tax considerations only\nand is not intended as a substitute for\ncareful tax planning. Purchasers of shares\nshould consult their own tax advisors as to\nthe tax consequences of investing in such\nshares, including consequences under state,\nlocal and non-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date of this SAI. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.

We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals.

340\ninvestment series or portfolios. The Trust was\norganized as a Delaware statutory trust on\nDecember 16, 1999 and is authorized to have\nmultiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 Act.\nThe offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ). This SAI\nrelates to the following Funds: \u2022 iShares\nCohen & Steers REIT ETF \u2022 iShares Core\nDividend ETF \u2022 iShares Core Dividend Growth\nETF \u2022 iShares Core High Dividend ETF \u2022 iShares\nCore U.S. REIT ETF \u2022 iShares Dow Jones U.S.\nETF \u2022 iShares Morningstar Growth ETF \u2022 iShares\nMorningstar Mid-Cap ETF \u2022 iShares Morningstar\nMid-Cap Growth ETF \u2022 iShares Morningstar Mid-\nCap Value ETF \u2022 iShares Morningstar Small-Cap\nETF \u2022 iShares Morningstar Small-Cap Growth ETF\n\u2022 iShares Morningstar Small-Cap Value ETF \u2022\niShares Morningstar U.S. Equity ETF \u2022 iShares\nMorningstar Value ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI KLD 400\nSocial ETF \u2022 iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF \u2022\niShares Select Dividend ETF \u2022 iShares U.S.\nBasic Materials ETF \u2022 iShares U.S. Consumer\nDiscretionary ETF \u2022 iShares U.S. Consumer\nStaples ETF \u2022 iShares U.S. Energy ETF \u2022\niShares U.S. Financial Services ETF \u2022 iShares\nU.S. Financials ETF \u2022 iShares U.S. Healthcare\nETF \u2022 iShares U.S. Industrials ETF \u2022 iShares\nU.S. Technology ETF \u2022 iShares U.S.\nTransportation ETF \u2022 iShares U.S. Utilities\nETF Each Fund is managed by BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ), an indirect wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally\nseeks to track the investment results of the\nspecific benchmark index identified in the\napplicable Prospectus for that Fund (each, an\n\u201c Underlying Index \u201d ). Each Fund offers and\nissues shares at its net asset value per share\n( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in aggregations of a\nspecified number of shares (each, a \u201c Creation\nUnit \u201d ), generally in exchange for a\ndesignated portfolio of securities, assets or\nother positions\n\n1\n\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) included in its\nUnderlying Index (the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d\nor \u201c Creation Basket \u201d ), together with the\ndeposit of a specified cash payment (the \u201c\nCash Component \u201d ). Shares of the Funds are\nlisted for trading on national securities\nexchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. ( \u201c\nCboe BZX \u201d ), The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ( \u201c\nNasdaq \u201d ) or NYSE Arca, Inc. ( \u201c NYSE Arca \u201d\n) (each a \u201c Listing Exchange \u201d ). Shares of\neach Fund are traded in the secondary market\nand elsewhere at market prices that may be at,\nabove or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are\nredeemable only in Creation Units by\nAuthorized Participants (as defined in the\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role\nof the Authorized Participant section of this\nSAI) and, generally, in exchange for portfolio\nsecurities and a Cash Amount (as defined in\nthe Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI). Creation Units typically are a\nspecified number of shares, generally 50,000\nor multiples thereof. The Trust reserves the\nright to permit or require that creations and\nredemptions of shares are effected fully or\npartially in cash and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of cash. Shares may be\nissued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities, subject to various conditions,\nincluding a requirement that the Authorized\nParticipant maintain with the Trust collateral\nas set forth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to purchase Deposit\nSecurities. See the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI.\nTransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith creations or redemptions that include a\ncash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin each Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of each Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe applicable Prospectus. Shares of each Fund\nare listed for trading, and trade throughout\nthe day, on the applicable Listing Exchange\nand in other secondary markets. Shares of\ncertain Funds may also be listed on certain\nnon-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance\nthat the requirements of the Listing Exchange\nnecessary to maintain the listing of shares of\nany Fund will continue to be met. The Listing\nExchange may, but is not required to, remove\nthe shares of a Fund from listing if, among\nother things: (i) following the initial\n12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no\nlonger eligible to operate in reliance on Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act; (iii)\nany of the other listing requirements are not\ncontinuously maintained; or (iv) any event\nshall occur or condition shall exist that, in\nthe opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes\nfurther dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of a Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of a Fund through\na broker, you may incur a brokerage commission\ndetermined by that broker, as well as other\ncharges. The Trust reserves the right to\nadjust the share price of the Funds in the\nfuture to maintain convenient trading ranges\nfor investors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Funds or an investor's\nequity interest in the Funds. Investment\nStrategies and Risks Each Fund seeks to\nachieve its objective by investing primarily\nin securities issued by issuers that compose\nits relevant Underlying Index and in\ninvestments that provide substantially similar\nexposure to securities in the Underlying\nIndex. Each Fund operates as an index fund.\nAdverse performance of a security in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio will ordinarily not result in the\nelimination of the security from the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Each Fund engages in representative\nsampling, which is investing in a sample of\nsecurities selected by BFA to have a\ncollective investment profile similar to that\nof the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities\nselected have aggregate investment\ncharacteristics (based on market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\n\n2\n\nvariability, earnings valuation and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to those of the\nFund\u2019s Underlying Index. A fund that uses\nrepresentative sampling generally does not\nhold all of the securities that are in its\nunderlying index. Although the Funds do not\nseek leveraged returns, certain instruments\nused by the Funds may have a leveraging effect\nas described below. Borrowing. Each Fund may\nborrow for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The purchase\nof securities while borrowings are outstanding\nmay have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The\nincurrence of leverage increases a Fund\u2019s\nexposure to risk, and borrowed funds are\nsubject to interest costs that will reduce net\nincome. Purchasing securities while borrowings\nare outstanding creates special risks, such as\nthe potential for greater volatility in the\nNAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a\nFund\u2019s portfolio. In addition, the interest\nexpenses from borrowings may exceed the income\ngenerated by a Fund\u2019s portfolio and,\ntherefore, the amount available (if any) for\ndistribution to shareholders as dividends may\nbe reduced. BFA may determine to maintain\noutstanding borrowings if it expects that the\nbenefits to a Fund\u2019s shareholders will\noutweigh the current reduced return. Certain\ntypes of borrowings by a Fund must be made\nfrom a bank or may result in a Fund being\nsubject to covenants in credit agreements\nrelating to asset coverage, portfolio\ncomposition requirements and other matters. It\nis not anticipated that observance of such\ncovenants would impede BFA\u2019s management of a\nFund\u2019s portfolio in accordance with a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire a Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Currency\nTransactions. A currency forward contract is\nan over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) obligation to\npurchase or sell a specific currency at a\nfuture date, which may be any fixed number of\ndays greater than two days from the date on\nwhich the contract is agreed upon by the\nparties, at a price set at the time of the\ncontract. A non-deliverable currency forward\nis an OTC currency forward settled in a\nspecified currency, on a specified date, based\non the difference between the agreed-upon\nexchange rate and the market exchange rate. A\ncurrency futures contract is a contract that\ntrades on an organized futures exchange\ninvolving an obligation to deliver or acquire\na specified amount of a specific currency, at\na specified price and at a specified future\ntime. Currency futures contracts may be\nsettled on a net cash payment basis rather\nthan by the sale and delivery of the\nunderlying currency. The Funds do not expect\nto engage in currency transactions for the\npurpose of hedging against declines in the\nvalue of the Funds' assets that are\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may\nenter into non-U.S. currency forward and\nnon-U.S. currency futures transactions to\nfacilitate local securities settlements or to\nprotect against currency exposure in\nconnection with its distributions to\nshareholders, but may not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes. Foreign\nexchange transactions involve a significant\ndegree of risk and the markets in which\nforeign exchange transactions are effected may\nbe highly volatile, highly specialized and\nhighly technical. Significant changes,\nincluding changes in liquidity and prices, can\noccur in such markets within very short\nperiods of time, often within minutes. Foreign\nexchange trading risks include, but are not\nlimited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty\nrisk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and\npotential interference by foreign governments\nthrough regulation of local exchange markets,\nforeign investment or particular transactions\nin non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the correlation of a\nFund's return with the performance of its\nUnderlying Index and may lower the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. A Fund could experience losses if the\nvalue of its currency forwards, options or\nfutures positions were poorly correlated with\nits other investments or if it could not close\nout its positions because of an illiquid\nmarket or otherwise. In addition, a Fund could\nincur transaction costs, including trading\ncommissions, in connection with certain\nnon-U.S. currency transactions.\nDiversification Status. The following table\nsets forth the diversification status of each\nFund:\n                                              \n  Diversified Funds     Non-Diversified       \n                        Funds                 \n  iShares Core          iShares Cohen &       \n  Dividend ETF          Steers REIT ETF       \n  iShares Core          iShares Core High     \n  Dividend Growth ETF   Dividend ETF          \n  iShares Core U.S.     iShares Morningstar   \n  REIT ETF              Growth ETF            \n                                              \n3\n                                              \n  Diversified Funds     Non-Diversified       \n                        Funds                 \n  iShares Dow Jones     iShares U.S. Basic    \n  U.S. ETF              Materials ETF         \n  iShares Morningstar   iShares U.S.          \n  Mid-Cap ETF           Consumer Staples ETF  \n  iShares Morningstar   iShares U.S. Energy   \n  Mid-Cap Growth ETF    ETF                   \n  iShares Morningstar   iShares U.S.          \n  Mid-Cap Value ETF     Financial Services    \n                        ETF                   \n  iShares Morningstar   iShares U.S.          \n  Small-Cap ETF         Healthcare ETF        \n  iShares Morningstar   iShares U.S.          \n  Small-Cap Growth ETF  Technology ETF        \n  iShares Morningstar   iShares U.S.          \n  Small-Cap Value ETF   Transportation ETF    \n  iShares Morningstar   iShares U.S.          \n  U.S. Equity ETF       Utilities ETF         \n  iShares Morningstar                         \n  Value ETF                                   \n  iShares MSCI KLD 400                        \n  Social ETF *                                \n  iShares MSCI USA ESG                        \n  Select ETF                                  \n  iShares Select                              \n  Dividend ETF                                \n  iShares U.S.                                \n  Consumer                                    \n  Discretionary ETF                           \n  iShares U.S.                                \n  Financials ETF                              \n  iShares U.S.                                \n  Industrials ETF                             \n                                              \n* The iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF intends\nto be diversified in approximately the same\nproportion as its Underlying Index is\ndiversified. The iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social\nETF may become non-diversified, as defined in\nthe 1940 Act, solely as a result of a change\nin relative market capitalization or index\nweighting of one or more constituents of its\nUnderlying Index. Shareholder approval will\nnot be sought if the iShares MSCI KLD 400\nSocial ETF crosses from diversified to non-\ndiversified status due solely to a change in\nits relative market capitalization or index\nweighting of one or more constituents of its\nUnderlying Index. The Funds disclose their\nportfolio holdings and weightings at\nwww.iShares.com. A fund classified as \u201c\ndiversified \u201d under the 1940 Act may not\npurchase securities of an issuer (other than\n(i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the\nU.S. government, its agencies or\ninstrumentalities and (ii) securities of other\ninvestment companies) if, with respect to 75%\nof its total assets, (a) more than 5% of the\nfund\u2019s total assets would be invested in\nsecurities of that issuer or (b) the fund\nwould hold more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of that issuer. With respect\nto the remaining 25% of its total assets, the\nfund may invest more than 5% of its assets in\none issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot\nchange its classification from diversified to\nnon-diversified without shareholder approval.\nHowever, while the iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social\nETF is classified as \u201c diversified, \u201d under\napplicable no-action relief from the SEC\nstaff, the fund may become non-diversified, as\ndefined in the 1940 Act, solely as a result of\na change in relative market capitalization or\nindex weighting of one or more constituents of\nits Underlying Index and such a change does\nnot require shareholder approval. A \u201c non-\ndiversified \u201d fund is a fund that is not\nlimited by the 1940 Act with regard to the\npercentage of its assets that may be invested\nin the securities of a single issuer. The\nsecurities of a particular issuer (or\nsecurities of issuers in particular\nindustries) may constitute a significant\npercentage of the underlying index of such a\nfund and, consequently, the fund\u2019s investment\nportfolio. This may adversely affect a fund\u2019s\nperformance or subject the fund\u2019s shares to\ngreater price volatility than that experienced\nby more diversified investment companies. Each\nFund (whether diversified or non-diversified)\nintends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S.\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of certain Funds and may make it\nless likely that the Funds will meet their\nrespective investment objectives. Futures,\nOptions on Futures and Securities Options.\nFutures contracts, options on futures and\nsecurities options may be used by a Fund to\nsimulate investment in its Underlying Index,\nto facilitate trading or to reduce transaction\ncosts. Each Fund may enter into futures\ncontracts and options on futures that are\ntraded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange.\nEach Fund will not use futures, options on\nfutures or securities options for speculative\npurposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and\n\n4\n\noptions on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5\nof the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under the\nCommodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA, with\nrespect to certain Funds, has claimed an\nexclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d in accordance with\nRule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such\nFunds, is not subject to registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under\nthe CEA. See the Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives section of this SAI for more\ninformation. Futures contracts provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. Each\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, a Fund will\nbe required to deposit with the broker an\namount of cash or cash equivalents known as \u201c\ninitial margin, \u201d which is similar to a\nperformance bond or good faith deposit on the\ncontract and is returned to the Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, each Fund may elect to close the\nposition by taking an opposite position, which\nwill operate to terminate the Fund\u2019s existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof each Fund. The potential for loss related\nto writing call options is unlimited. The\npotential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. Certain of the Funds may purchase and\nwrite put and call options on futures\ncontracts that are traded on an exchange as a\nhedge against changes in value of their\nportfolio securities or in anticipation of the\npurchase of securities, and may enter into\nclosing transactions with respect to such\noptions to terminate existing positions. There\nis no guarantee that such closing transactions\ncan be effected. Securities options may be\nused by a Fund to obtain access to securities\nin its Underlying Index or to dispose of\nsecurities in its Underlying Index at\nfavorable prices, to invest cash in a\nsecurities index that offers similar exposure\nto that provided by its Underlying Index or\notherwise to achieve the Fund\u2019s objective of\ntracking its Underlying Index. A call option\ngives a holder the right to purchase a\nspecific security at a specified price ( \u201c\nexercise price \u201d ) within a specified period\nof time. A put option gives a holder the right\nto sell a specific security at an exercise\nprice within a specified period of time. The\ninitial purchaser of a call option pays the \u201c\nwriter \u201d a premium, which is paid at the time\nof purchase and is retained by the writer\nwhether or not such option is exercised. Each\nFund may purchase put options to hedge its\nportfolio against the risk of a decline in the\nmarket value of securities held and may\npurchase call options to hedge against an\nincrease in the price of securities it is\ncommitted to purchase. Each Fund may write put\nand call options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell\nsecurities options on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nsecurities exchange or in the OTC market\nthrough a transaction with a dealer. Options\non a securities index are typically settled on\na net basis based on the appreciation or\ndepreciation of the index level over the\nstrike price. Options on single name\nsecurities may be cash- or physically-settled,\ndepending upon the market in which they are\ntraded. Options may be structured so as to be\nexercisable only on certain dates or on a\ndaily basis. Options may also be structured to\nhave conditions to exercise ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-\nin Events \u201d ) or conditions that trigger\ntermination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out Events \u201d ).\nLending Portfolio Securities. Each Fund may\nlend portfolio securities to certain borrowers\nthat BFA determines to be creditworthy,\nincluding borrowers affiliated with BFA. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is\nmaintained in an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent market value of the securities loaned.\nNo securities loan shall be made on behalf of\na Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of\nall securities loans of the particular Fund\nexceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's\ntotal\n\n5\n\nassets (including the value of the collateral\nreceived). A Fund may terminate a loan at any\ntime and obtain the return of the securities\nloaned. Each Fund receives, by way of\nsubstitute payment, the value of any interest\nor cash or non-cash distributions paid on the\nloaned securities that it would have otherwise\nreceived if the securities were not on loan.\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized\nby cash, the borrower may be entitled to\nreceive a fee based on the amount of cash\ncollateral. The Funds are compensated by any\npositive difference between the amount earned\non the reinvestment of cash collateral and the\nfee paid to the borrower. In the case of\ncollateral other than cash, a Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of each Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nEach Fund conducts its securities lending\npursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC\npermitting it to lend portfolio securities to\nborrowers affiliated with the Fund and to\nretain an affiliate of the Fund to act as\nsecurities lending agent. To the extent that a\nFund engages in securities lending, BlackRock\nInstitutional Trust Company, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d )\nacts as securities lending agent for the Fund,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC\nadministers the lending program in accordance\nwith guidelines approved by the Trust's Board\nof Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the trustees of\nwhich are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ). JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d ) serves as\ncustodian for the Funds in connection with\ncertain securities lending activities.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk\n(i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If a Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Funds'\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, a Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return a Fund\u2019s securities as agreed, the\nFund\u2019s ability to participate in a corporate\naction event may be impacted, or the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. This latter event\ncould trigger adverse tax consequences for a\nFund. A Fund could lose money if its short-\nterm investment of the collateral declines in\nvalue over the period of the loan. Substitute\npayments received by a Fund representing\ndividends paid on securities loaned out by the\nFund will not be considered qualified dividend\nincome. BTC will take into account the tax\neffects on shareholders caused by this\ndifference in connection with a Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to a Fund (as permitted by\napplicable law). Regulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require certain bank-\nregulated counterparties and certain of their\naffiliates to include in certain financial\ncontracts, including many securities lending\nagreements, terms that delay or restrict the\nrights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to\nterminate such agreements, foreclose upon\ncollateral, exercise other default rights or\nrestrict transfers of credit support in the\nevent that the counterparty and/or its\naffiliates are subject to certain types of\nresolution or insolvency proceedings. It is\npossible that these requirements, as well as\npotential additional government regulation and\nother developments in the market, could\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to\nterminate existing securities lending\nagreements or to realize amounts to be\nreceived under such agreements. Liquidity Risk\nManagement. Rule 22e-4 under the Investment\nCompany Act (the \u201c Liquidity Rule \u201d ) requires\nopen-end funds, including exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) such as the Funds, to\nestablish a liquidity risk management program\n(the \u201c Liquidity Program \u201d ) and enhance\ndisclosures regarding fund liquidity. As\nrequired by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have\nimplemented a Liquidity Program, and the\nBoard, including a majority of the Independent\nTrustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as\nthe administrator of the Liquidity Program.\nUnder the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses,\nmanages, and\n\n6\n\nperiodically reviews each Fund\u2019s liquidity\nrisk and classifies each investment held by a\nFund as a \u201c highly liquid investment, \u201d \u201c\nmoderately liquid investment, \u201d \u201c less liquid\ninvestment \u201d or \u201c illiquid investment. \u201d The\nLiquidity Rule defines \u201c liquidity risk \u201d as\nthe risk that a Fund could not meet requests\nto redeem shares issued by a Fund without\nsignificant dilution of the remaining\ninvestors\u2019 interest in a Fund. The liquidity\nof a Fund's portfolio investments is\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment-specific considerations under\nthe Liquidity Program. There are exclusions\nfrom certain portions of the liquidity risk\nmanagement program requirements for \u201c in-kind\n\u201d ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To\nthe extent that an investment is deemed to be\nan illiquid investment or a less liquid\ninvestment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to\ngreater liquidity risk. Non-U.S. Securities.\nCertain Funds intend to purchase publicly\ntraded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To\nthe extent a Fund invests in stocks of\nnon-U.S. issuers, certain of the Fund's\ninvestments in such stocks may be in the form\nof American Depositary Receipts ( \u201c ADRs \u201d ),\nGlobal Depositary Receipts ( \u201c GDRs \u201d ) and\nEuropean Depositary Receipts ( \u201c EDRs \u201d )\n(collectively, \u201c depositary receipts \u201d ).\nDepositary receipts are receipts, typically\nissued by a bank or trust issuer, which\nevidence ownership of underlying securities\nissued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary\nreceipts may not necessarily be denominated in\nthe same currency as their underlying\nsecurities. ADRs typically are issued by a\nU.S. bank or trust company and evidence\nownership of underlying securities issued by a\nnon-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes\nreferred to as continental depositary\nreceipts, are receipts issued in Europe,\ntypically by foreign banks and trust\ncompanies, that evidence ownership of either\nforeign or domestic underlying securities.\nGDRs are depositary receipts structured like\nglobal debt issues to facilitate trading on an\ninternational basis. Generally, ADRs, issued\nin registered form, are designed for use in\nthe U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued\nin bearer form, are designed for use in\nEuropean securities markets. GDRs are tradable\nboth in the U.S. and in Europe and are\ndesigned for use throughout the world.\nDepositary receipts are generally subject to\nthe same risks as the foreign securities that\nthey evidence or into which they may be\nconverted. In addition to investment risks\nassociated with the underlying issuer,\ndepositary receipts expose a Fund to\nadditional risks associated with the non-\nuniform terms that apply to depositary receipt\nprograms, credit exposure to the depository\nbank and to the sponsors and other parties\nwith whom the depository bank establishes the\nprograms, currency risk and liquidity risk.\nUnsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned\nby the issuer of the underlying common stock,\ngenerally expose investors to greater risks\nthan sponsored programs and do not provide\nholders with many of the shareholder benefits\nthat come from investing in a sponsored\ndepositary receipts. Investing in the\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers involves\nspecial risks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in U.S. issuers.\nThese include differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards;\nthe possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation; adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations;\npolitical instability, which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in non-U.S. countries; and\npotential restrictions on the flow of\ninternational capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be\nsubject to less governmental regulation than\nU.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S.\neconomies may differ favorably or unfavorably\nfrom the U.S. economy in such respects as\ngrowth of gross domestic product ( \u201c GDP \u201d ),\nrate of inflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and balance of\npayment positions. Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives. The CFTC subjects advisers to\nregistered investment companies to regulation\nby the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the\nadviser either (i) invests, directly or\nindirectly, more than a prescribed level of\nits liquidation value in CFTC-regulated\nfutures, options and swaps ( \u201c CFTC\nDerivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to each of the Funds. BFA is not,\ntherefore, subject to registration or\nregulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA with respect to the Funds. The\niShares Core Dividend ETF, iShares Core U.S.\nREIT ETF, iShares Dow Jones U.S. ETF, iShares\nMorningstar Growth ETF, iShares Morningstar\nMid-Cap ETF, iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap\nGrowth ETF, iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Value\nETF, iShares Morningstar Small-Cap ETF,\niShares Morningstar Small-Cap Growth ETF,\niShares Morningstar Small-Cap Value ETF,\niShares Morningstar U.S. Equity ETF, iShares\nMorningstar Value ETF, iShares U.S. Financial\nServices ETF and iShares U.S. Financials ETF\n(the \u201c No-Action Letter Funds \u201d ) may also\nhave investments in \u201c underlying funds \u201d (and\nsuch underlying funds themselves may invest in\nunderlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term\n\u201c underlying fund \u201d for purposes of the no-\naction\n\n7\n\nletter referenced below may include, but is\nnot limited to, certain securitized vehicles,\nmortgage or international real estate\ninvestment trusts, business development\ncompanies and, investment companies that may\ninvest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of the\nforegoing), and therefore may be viewed by the\nCFTC as commodity pools. BFA may not have\ntransparency into the holdings of these\nunderlying funds because they are not advised\nby BFA. To address this issue of lack of\ntransparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-\naction letter on November 29, 2012 permitting\nthe adviser of a fund that invests in such\nunderlying funds and that would otherwise have\nfiled a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC\nRule 4.5 to delay registration as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d until six months\nfrom the date on which the CFTC issues\nadditional guidance on the treatment of CFTC\nDerivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the\nadviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has\nfiled a claim with the CFTC for the Funds to\nrely on this no-action relief. Accordingly,\nBFA is not currently subject to registration\nor regulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA in respect of the Funds.\nDerivative contracts, including, without\nlimitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-\ndeliverable forwards, are subject to\nregulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act ( \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under comparable\nregimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.\njurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards\nand certain other derivatives traded in the\nOTC market are subject to variation margin and\ninitial margin requirements. Implementation of\nthe margining and other provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory\ntrading, reporting and documentation of swaps\nand other derivatives have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact the costs to a Fund of\ntrading these instruments and, as a result,\nmay affect returns to investors in a Fund.\nRule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act\npermits a Fund to enter into Derivatives\nTransactions (as defined below) and certain\nother transactions notwithstanding the\nrestrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior\nsecurities \u201d under Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act. Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act, among other things,\nprohibits open-end funds, including the Funds,\nfrom issuing or selling any \u201c senior security,\n\u201d other than borrowing from a bank (subject to\na requirement to maintain 300% \u201c asset\ncoverage \u201d ). Under Rule 18f-4, \u201c Derivatives\nTransactions \u201d include the following: (1) any\nswap, security-based swap (including a\ncontract for differences), futures contract,\nforward contract, option (excluding purchased\noptions), any combination of the foregoing, or\nany similar instrument, under which a Fund is\nor may be required to make any payment or\ndelivery of cash or other assets during the\nlife of the instrument or at maturity or early\ntermination, whether as margin or settlement\npayment or otherwise; (2) any short sale\nborrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions ( e.g. ,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nand borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat\nthese transactions as Derivatives Transactions\nunder Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or\nforward-settling securities ( e.g. , firm and\nstandby commitments, including to-be-announced\n( \u201c TBA \u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and\nnon-standard settlement cycle securities,\nunless the Fund intends to physically settle\nthe transaction and the transaction will\nsettle within 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\nUnless a Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to\nadopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if a Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Repurchase\nAgreements. A repurchase agreement is an\ninstrument under which the purchaser ( i.e. ,\na Fund) acquires a security and the seller\nagrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase\nthe security at a mutually agreed-upon time\nand price, thereby determining the yield\nduring the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by a Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Fund may suffer\ntime delays and incur costs or losses in\nconnection with the disposition of the\ncollateral.\n\n8\n\nIn any repurchase transaction, the collateral\nfor a repurchase agreement may include: (i)\ncash items; (ii) obligations issued by the\nU.S. government or its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that,\nat the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for a\nFund that utilizes them. Such risks are not\nunique to the Funds, but are inherent in\nrepurchase agreements. The Funds seek to\nminimize such risks, but because of the\ninherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, a Fund\nwould likely retain the status of an unsecured\ncreditor of the counterparty ( i.e. , the\nposition a Fund would normally be in if it\nwere to hold, pursuant to its investment\npolicies, other unsecured debt securities of\nthe defaulting counterparty) with respect to\nthe amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured\ncreditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing\nsome or all of the principal and income\ninvolved in the transaction. Reverse\nRepurchase Agreements. Reverse repurchase\nagreements involve the sale of securities with\nan agreement to repurchase the securities at\nan agreed-upon price, date and interest\npayment and have the characteristics of\nborrowing. Generally, the effect of such\ntransactions is that a Fund can recover all or\nmost of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are advantageous\nonly if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a\nrate of interest on the cash derived from\nthese transactions that is greater than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available, and a Fund intends to use\nthe reverse repurchase technique only when BFA\nbelieves it will be advantageous to the Fund.\nThe use of reverse repurchase agreements may\nexaggerate any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of a Fund\u2019s assets. The use of reverse\nrepurchase agreements is a form of leverage,\nand the proceeds obtained by a Fund through\nreverse repurchase agreements may be invested\nin additional securities. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits a Fund to enter\ninto reverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions ( e.g., recourse and\nnon-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed\nbonds) notwithstanding the limitation on the\nissuance of senior securities in Section 18 of\nthe Investment Company Act, provided that a\nFund either (i) complies with the 300% asset\ncoverage ratio with respect to such\ntransactions and any other borrowings in the\naggregate, or (ii) treats such transactions as\nDerivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4.\n(See \u201c Regulation Regarding Derivatives \u201d\nabove.) Securities of Investment Companies.\nEach Fund may invest in the securities of\nother investment companies (including money\nmarket funds) and real estate investment\ntrusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ) to the extent permitted\nby law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment in registered investment companies\nis generally limited to, subject to certain\nexceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of any one investment company;\n(ii) 5% of a Fund\u2019s total assets with respect\nto any one investment company; and (iii) 10%\nof a Fund\u2019s total assets with respect to\ninvestment companies in the aggregate. Other\ninvestment companies in which a Fund may\ninvest can be expected to incur fees and\nexpenses for operations, such as investment\nadvisory and administration fees, which would\nbe in addition to those incurred by the Fund.\nPursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff,\nfees and expenses of money market funds used\nfor cash collateral received in connection\nwith loans of securities are not treated as\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect\na Fund\u2019s pro rata share of the fees and\nexpenses incurred by investing in other\ninvestment companies (as disclosed in the\nProspectus, as applicable). Short-Term\nInstruments and Temporary Investments. Each\nFund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, on an\nongoing basis to provide liquidity or for\nother reasons. Money market instruments are\ngenerally short-term investments that may\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) shares of\nmoney market funds (including those advised by\nBFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c\nCDs \u201d ), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed-time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nnon-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches)\nand similar institutions; (iv) commercial\npaper rated, at the date of purchase, \u201c\nPrime-1 \u201d by Moody's \u00ae Investors Service, Inc.\n( \u201c Moody's \u201d ), \u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch Ratings,\nInc. ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ), or \u201c A-1 \u201d by Standard &\nPoor\u2019s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of\nS&P Global, Inc. ( \u201c S&P Global Ratings \u201d ),\nor if unrated, of comparable quality as\ndetermined by BFA; (v) non-convertible\ncorporate debt securities ( e.g. , bonds and\ndebentures) with remaining maturities at the\ndate of purchase of not more than 397 days and\nthat\n\n9\n\nhave been determined to present minimal credit\nrisks, in accordance with the requirements set\nforth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi)\nrepurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term\nU.S. dollar-denominated obligations of\nnon-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that,\nin the opinion of BFA, are of comparable\nquality to obligations of U.S. banks that may\nbe purchased by a Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions. Swap Agreements.\nSwap agreements are contracts between parties\nin which one party agrees to make periodic\npayments to the other party based on a pre-\ndetermined underlying investment or notional\namount. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the first party\nbased on the return (or a differential in rate\nof return) earned or realized on the\nunderlying investment or notional amount. Swap\nagreements will usually be performed on a net\nbasis, with a Fund receiving or paying only\nthe net amount of the two payments. The net\namount of the excess, if any, of a Fund\u2019s\nobligations over its entitlements with respect\nto each swap is accrued on a daily basis.\nCertain of the Funds may enter into swap\nagreements, including currency swaps, interest\nrate swaps and index swaps, or total return\nswaps (some of which may be referred to as\ncontracts for difference or \u201c CFDs \u201d ). The\nuse of swaps is a highly specialized activity\nthat involves investment techniques and risks\ndifferent from those associated with ordinary\nportfolio security transactions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets. Tracking Stocks. A tracking stock is a\nseparate class of common stock whose value is\nlinked to a specific business unit or\noperating division within a larger company and\nis designed to \u201c track \u201d the performance of\nsuch business unit or division. The tracking\nstock may pay dividends to shareholders\nindependent of the parent company. The parent\ncompany, rather than the business unit or\ndivision, generally is the issuer of tracking\nstock. However, holders of the tracking stock\nmay not have the same rights as holders of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock. Future Developments.\nThe Board may, in the future, authorize each\nFund to invest in securities contracts and\ninvestments, other than those listed in this\nSAI and in the applicable Prospectuses,\nprovided they are consistent with each Fund's\ninvestment objective and do not violate any of\nits investment restrictions or policies.\nGeneral Considerations and Risks A discussion\nof some of the principal risks associated with\nan investment in a Fund is contained in the\napplicable Prospectus. An investment in a Fund\nshould be made with an understanding that the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of stocks in\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce a Fund\u2019s return.\nBorrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to\ndo so to satisfy its obligations. Dividend-\nPaying Stock Risk. Investing in dividend-\npaying stocks involves the risk that such\nstocks may fall out of favor with investors\nand underperform the broader market. Companies\nthat issue dividend-paying stocks are not\nrequired to pay or continue paying dividends\non such stocks. It is possible that issuers of\nthe stocks held by a Fund will not declare\ndividends in the future or will reduce or\neliminate the payment of dividends (including\nreducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends) in the future. Illiquid Investments\nRisk. Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that a Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without significantly changing the market\nvalue of the investment. The liquidity of an\ninvestment will be determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment\nspecific considerations as set out in the\nLiquidity Program as required by the Liquidity\nRule. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken.\n\n10\n\nInfectious Illness Risk. A widespread outbreak\nof an infectious illness, such as the COVID-19\npandemic, may adversely affect the economies\nof many nations and the global economy and may\nimpact individual issuers and capital markets\nin ways that cannot be foreseen. An infectious\nillness outbreak may result in travel\nrestrictions, closed international borders,\ndisruption of healthcare services, prolonged\nquarantines, cancellations, supply chain\ndisruptions, temporary and permanent business\nclosures, lower consumer demand, layoffs,\nratings downgrades, credit defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and political\nimpacts, as well as general concern and\nuncertainty. An outbreak may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social and economic\nrisks in certain countries or globally. These\nimpacts, which could adversely affect a Fund\nand its investments, could be present for an\nextended period of time. In addition, markets\nmay experience temporary closures, extreme\nvolatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity\nand increased trading costs. Such events may\nadversely affect a Fund and its investments\nand may impact a Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or\nsell securities or other assets. Market or\neconomic disruptions could cause elevated\ntracking error and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to a Fund's NAV. Additionally, a\nFund could be adversely impacted if an\noutbreak impairs the operations of its service\nproviders, including BFA. Governmental and\nquasi-governmental may respond to an outbreak\nand any resulting disruptions with a variety\nof fiscal and monetary policy changes, such as\nchanges in interest rates. A reversal of these\npolicies, or the ineffectiveness of such\npolicies, is likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely affect a\nFund\u2019s investments. Money Market Instruments\nRisk. A Fund may hold money market\ninstruments. The value of money market\ninstruments may be affected by changes in\ninterest rates or in the credit ratings of the\ninvestments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of a Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. It is possible to\nlose money by investing in a money market\nfund. Money market funds other than U.S.\ngovernment money market funds and retail money\nmarket funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV instead of\nusing a stable $1.00 per share price.\nOperational Risk. BFA and a Fund's other\nservice providers may experience disruptions\nor operating errors such as processing errors\nor human errors, inadequate or failed internal\nor external processes, or systems or\ntechnology failures, that could negatively\nimpact the Funds. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from a Fund\u2019s in the setting of\npriorities, the personnel and resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. BFA, through its monitoring and\noversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect a\nFund or to develop processes and controls to\ncompletely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Reference Rate\nReplacement Risk. A Fund may be exposed to\nfinancial instruments that recently\ntransitioned from, or continue to be tied to,\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate ( \u201c LIBOR \u201d\n) to determine payment obligations, financing\nterms, hedging strategies or investment value.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct\nAuthority ( \u201c FCA \u201d ), which regulates LIBOR,\nhas ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In\nApril 2023, however, the FCA announced that\nsome USD LIBOR settings will continue to be\npublished under a synthetic methodology until\nSeptember 30, 2024 for certain legacy\ncontracts. The Secured Overnight Financing\nRate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which is a broad measure of\nthe cost of borrowing cash overnight\ncollateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in\nthe repurchase agreement market, has been used\nincreasingly on a voluntary basis in new\ninstruments and transactions. Under U.S.\nregulations that implement a statutory\nfallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark\nrates based on SOFR have replaced LIBOR in\ndifferent categories of financial contracts.\nNeither the effect of the LIBOR transition\nprocess nor its ultimate success can yet be\nknown. While some existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate-setting methodology, there\nmay be significant uncertainty regarding the\neffectiveness of any such alternative\nmethodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all\nexisting LIBOR-based instruments may have\nalternative rate-setting provisions and there\nremains uncertainty regarding the willingness\nand ability of issuers to add alternative\nrate-setting provisions in certain existing\ninstruments. Parties to contracts, securities,\nor other instruments using LIBOR may disagree\non transition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. A Fund may have\ninstruments linked to other interbank offered\nrates that may also cease to be published in\nthe future.\n\n11\n\nRisk of Derivatives. A derivative is a\nfinancial contract, the value of which depends\non, or is derived from, the value of an\nunderlying asset, such as a security, a\ncommodity (such as gold or silver), a currency\nor an index (a measure of value or rates, such\nas the S&P 500 \u00ae or the prime lending rate). A\nFund may invest in futures contracts,\nsecurities options, CFDs and other\nderivatives. Compared to securities,\nderivatives can be more sensitive to changes\nin interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in\nmarket prices and thus a Fund\u2019s losses may be\ngreater if it invests in derivatives than if\nit invests only in conventional securities.\nDerivatives are also subject to counterparty\nrisk, which is the risk that the other party\nin the transaction will not fulfill its\ncontractual obligations. Derivatives generally\ninvolve the incurrence of leverage. When a\nderivative is used as a hedge against a\nposition that a Fund holds or is committed to\npurchase, any loss generated by the derivative\ngenerally should be substantially offset by\ngains on the hedged investment, and vice\nversa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate\nlosses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains,\nand in some cases, hedging can cause losses\nthat are not offset by gains, and the Fund\nwill recognize losses on both the investment\nand the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to\nimperfect matching between the derivative and\nthe underlying security, and there can be no\nassurance that a Fund's hedging transactions,\nwhich entail additional transaction costs,\nwill be effective. Risk of Equity Securities.\nAn investment in a Fund should be made with an\nunderstanding of the risks inherent in an\ninvestment in equity securities, including the\nrisk that the financial condition of issuers\nmay become impaired or that the general\ncondition of stock markets may deteriorate\n(either of which may cause a decrease in the\nvalue of the portfolio securities and thus in\nthe value of shares of the Fund). Common\nstocks are susceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations and to increases and decreases in\nvalue as market confidence and perceptions of\ntheir issuers change. These investor\nperceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Common stocks may experience extreme\nprice volatility due to actions taken by\nparticular investors or groups of investors\n(for example, retail investors influenced by\nsocial media activity or other media coverage\nor significant \u201c short \u201d positions taken by\ninstitutional investors). Holders of common\nstocks incur more risks than holders of\npreferred stocks and debt obligations because\ncommon stockholders generally have rights to\nreceive payments from stock issuers that are\ninferior to the rights of creditors, or\nholders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (the value of which,\nhowever, is subject to market fluctuations\nprior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stocks have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity date. In addition, issuers may, in\ntimes of distress or at their own discretion,\ndecide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which\nmay also cause their stock price to decline.\nAlthough most of the securities in each\nUnderlying Index are listed on a securities\nexchange, the principal trading market for\nsome of the securities may be in the OTC\nmarket. The existence of a liquid trading\nmarket for certain securities may depend on\nwhether dealers will make a market in such\nsecurities. There can be no assurance that a\nmarket will be made or maintained or that any\nsuch market will be or remain liquid. The\nprice at which securities may be sold and the\nvalue of a Fund\u2019s shares will be adversely\naffected if trading markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities are limited or absent, or\nif bid/ask spreads are wide. Risk of Futures\nand Options on Futures Transactions. There are\nseveral risks accompanying the utilization of\nfutures contracts and options on futures\ncontracts. A position in futures contracts and\noptions on futures contracts may be closed\nonly on the exchange on which the contract was\nmade (or a linked exchange). While each Fund\nplans to utilize futures contracts only if an\nactive market exists for such contracts, there\nis no guarantee that a liquid market will\nexist for the contract at a specified time.\nFutures contracts, by definition, project\nprice levels in the future and not current\nlevels of valuation; therefore, market\ncircumstances may result in a discrepancy\nbetween the price of the future and the\nmovement in a Fund's Underlying Index. In the\nevent of adverse price movements, a Fund would\ncontinue to be required to make daily cash\npayments to maintain its required margin. In\nsuch situations, if a Fund has insufficient\ncash, it may have to sell portfolio securities\nto meet daily margin requirements at a time\nwhen it may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, a Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\n\n12\n\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit their risk exposure to\nlevels comparable to a direct investment in\nthe types of stocks in which they invest.\nUtilization of futures and options on futures\nby a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or\neven negative correlation to its Underlying\nIndex if the index underlying the futures\ncontract differs from the Underlying Index.\nThere is also the risk of loss of margin\ndeposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom a Fund has an open position\nin the futures contract or option. The\npurchase of put or call options will be based\nupon predictions by BFA as to anticipated\ntrends, which predictions could prove to be\nincorrect. Because the futures market\ngenerally imposes less burdensome margin\nrequirements than the securities market, an\nincreased amount of participation by\nspeculators in the futures market could result\nin price fluctuations. Certain financial\nfutures exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation permitted in futures contract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\nlimit establishes the maximum amount by which\nthe price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, each\nFund would be required to make daily cash\npayments of variation margin. Risk of\nInvesting in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. An\ninvestment in any of the Funds that invest,\ndirectly or indirectly, in non-U.S. equity\nsecurities involves risks similar to those of\ninvesting in portfolios of equity securities\ntraded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks\ninclude market fluctuations caused by such\nfactors as economic and political developments\nin those foreign countries, changes in\ninterest rates and perceived trends in stock\nprices. Investing in securities issued by\nissuers domiciled in countries other than the\ndomicile of the investor and denominated in\ncurrencies other than an investor\u2019s local\ncurrency entails certain considerations and\nrisks not typically encountered by the\ninvestor in making investments in its home\ncountry and in that country\u2019s currency. These\nconsiderations include favorable or\nunfavorable changes in interest rates,\ncurrency exchange rates, exchange control\nregulations and the costs that may be incurred\nin connection with conversions between various\ncurrencies. Investing in any of these Funds\nalso involves certain risks and considerations\nnot typically associated with investing in a\nfund whose portfolio contains exclusively\nsecurities of U.S. issuers. These risks\ninclude generally less liquid and less\nefficient securities markets; generally\ngreater price volatility; less publicly\navailable information about issuers; the\nimposition of withholding or other taxes; the\nimposition of restrictions on the expatriation\nof funds or other assets of the Funds; higher\ntransaction and custody costs; delays and\nrisks attendant in settlement procedures;\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual\nobligations; lower liquidity and significantly\nsmaller market capitalization; different\naccounting and disclosure standards; lower\nlevels of regulation of the securities\nmarkets; more substantial government\ninterference with the economy and businesses;\nhigher rates of inflation; greater social,\neconomic, and political uncertainty; the risk\nof nationalization or expropriation of assets;\nand the risk of war. Risk of Swap Agreements.\nThe risk of loss with respect to swaps is\ngenerally limited to the net amount of\npayments that a Fund is contractually\nobligated to make. Swap agreements are subject\nto the risk that the swap counterparty will\ndefault on its obligations. If such a default\noccurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies\npursuant to the agreements related to the\ntransaction. However, such remedies may be\nsubject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws,\nwhich could affect such Fund\u2019s rights as a\ncreditor ( e.g. , a Fund may not receive the\nnet amount of payments that it is\ncontractually entitled to receive). A Fund is\nrequired to post and collect variation margin\nand initial margin (comprised of specified\nliquid securities subject to haircuts) in\nconnection with trading of OTC swaps. These\nrequirements may raise the costs for a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment in swaps. Tracking Error Risk. A\nFund may be subject to tracking error, which\nis the divergence of a Fund\u2019s performance from\nthat of the applicable underlying index.\nTracking error may occur because of\ndifferences between the securities and other\ninstruments held in a Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in its applicable underlying\nindex, pricing differences, transaction costs\nincurred by a Fund, a Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in timing of the\naccrual of or the valuation of dividends or\ninterest received by a Fund or distributions\npaid to a Fund\u2019s shareholders, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions carried out\nto minimize the distribution of capital gains\nto shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the applicable underlying index or\nthe costs to a Fund of complying with various\nnew or existing regulatory requirements. This\nrisk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other\n\n13\n\nunusual market conditions. Tracking error also\nmay result because a Fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while its applicable underlying\nindex does not. Tracking error may occur due\nto differences between the methodologies used\nin calculating the value of the applicable\nUnderlying Index and determining a Fund\u2019s NAV.\nWhen an issuer is introduced by an index\nprovider into an index tracked by a Fund, BFA\nmay conduct an analysis on such issuer\u2019s\nsecurities to identify and screen for outlier\nhigh risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual\nprice growth that does not appear to be\nsupported by publicly available information on\nthe business and assets of the issuer, unusual\nor significant short interest or lending\nactivity, negative sentiment, suspended\ntrading or incorrect free-float calculations,\nwhich could be indicators of possible\nirregularities, miscalculations or even\nfraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA\nmay, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the\nrebalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from a\nFund\u2019s portfolio and, if it does so, such a\nfund will be subject to increased tracking\nerror due to the divergence in the securities\nincluded in its portfolio from its underlying\nindex. The application of the abovementioned\nanalysis and screening to a Fund and its\nUnderlying Index is in the sole discretion of\nBFA and its affiliates (without any\nguarantees). The analysis and screening may\nnot exclude any or all high risk securities\nfrom an Underlying Index or a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\na Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more such\nsecurities declines in value. Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries. Many\ncountries with developed markets have recently\nexperienced significant economic pressures.\nThese countries generally tend to rely on the\nservices sectors ( e.g. , the financial\nservices sector) as the primary source of\neconomic growth and may be susceptible to the\nrisks of individual service sectors. For\nexample, companies in the financial services\nsector are subject to governmental regulation\nand, recently, government intervention, which\nmay adversely affect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and\namount of capital they must maintain.\nDislocations in the financial sector and\nperceived or actual governmental influence\nover certain financial companies may lead to\ncredit rating downgrades and, as a result,\nimpact, among other things, revenue growth for\nsuch companies. If financial companies\nexperience a prolonged decline in revenue\ngrowth, certain developed countries that rely\nheavily on financial companies as an economic\ndriver may experience a correlative slowdown.\nConcerns have emerged with respect to the\neconomic health of certain developed\ncountries. These concerns primarily stem from\nheavy indebtedness of many developed countries\nand their perceived inability to continue to\nservice high debt loads without simultaneously\nimplementing stringent austerity measures.\nSuch concerns have led to tremendous downward\npressure on the economies of these countries.\nAs a result, it is possible that interest\nrates on debt of certain developed countries\nmay rise to levels that make it difficult for\nsuch countries to service such debt. Spending\non health care and retirement pensions in most\ndeveloped countries has risen dramatically.\nMedical innovation, extended life expectancy\nand higher public expectations are likely to\ncontinue the increase in health care and\npension costs. Any increase in health care and\npension costs will likely have a negative\nimpact on the economic growth of many\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries rely on imports of certain key\nitems, such as crude oil, natural gas, and\nother commodities. As a result, an increase in\ndemand for, or price fluctuations of, certain\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Developed market countries\ngenerally are dependent on the economies of\ncertain key trading partners. Changes in any\none economy may cause an adverse impact on\nseveral developed countries. In addition,\nheavy regulation of, among others, labor and\nproduct markets may have an adverse effect on\ncertain issuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value\nof a Fund\u2019s investments. Risk of Investing in\nthe Basic Materials Industry. Issuers in the\nbasic materials industry could be adversely\naffected by commodity price volatility,\ninflation, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, import controls and\nincreased competition. Companies in the basic\nmaterials industry may be subject to swift\nfluctuations in supply and demand.\nFluctuations may be caused by events relating\nto political and economic developments, the\nenvironmental impact of basic materials\noperations, and the success of exploration\nprojects. Production of industrial materials\noften exceeds demand as a result of over-\nbuilding or economic downturns, leading to\npoor investment returns. Issuers in the basic\nmaterials industry are at risk for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may be adversely affected by\ndepletion of resources, delays in technical\nprogress, labor relations, tax and government\nregulations related to changes to, among other\nthings, energy and environmental policies.\nRisk of Investing in the Communication\nServices Sector. The communication services\nsector consists of both companies in the\ntelecommunication services industry as well as\nthose in the media and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the telecommunication\nservices industry group include providers of\nfiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services\n\n14\n\nand products including television\nbroadcasting, gaming products, social media,\nnetworking platforms, online classifieds,\nonline review websites, and Internet search\nengines. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may be affected by industry\ncompetition, substantial capital requirements,\ngovernment regulation, and obsolescence of\ncommunications products and services due to\ntechnological advancement. Fluctuating\ndomestic and international demand, shifting\ndemographics and often unpredictable changes\nin consumer tastes can drastically affect a\ncommunication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Risk of Investing in the Consumer\nCyclical Industry. A Fund may invest in\nconsumer cyclical companies, which rely\nheavily on business cycles and economic\nconditions. Consumer cyclical companies\ninclude automotive manufacturers, retail\ncompanies, and housing-related companies. The\nconsumer cyclical industry can be\nsignificantly affected by several factors,\nincluding, without limitation, the performance\nof domestic and international economies,\nexchange rates, changing consumer tastes and\ntrends, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue\ngeneration, consumer confidence, commodity\nprice volatility, labor relations, interest\nrates, import and export controls, intense\ncompetition, technological developments and\ngovernment regulation. Risk of Investing in\nthe Consumer Defensive Industry. A Fund is\nsubject to risks faced by companies in the\nconsumer defensive industry, including:\ngovernmental regulation affecting the\npermissibility of using various food additives\nand production methods, which could affect\nprofitability; new laws or litigation that may\nadversely affect tobacco companies; fads,\nmarketing campaigns and other factors\naffecting supply and demand that may strongly\naffect securities prices and profitability of\nfood, beverage and fashion related products;\nand international events that may affect food\nand beverage companies that derive a\nsubstantial portion of their net income from\nforeign countries. Risk of Investing in the\nConsumer Discretionary Sector. Companies\nengaged in the design, production or\ndistribution of products or services for the\nconsumer discretionary sector (including,\nwithout limitation, television and radio\nbroadcasting, manufacturing, publishing,\nrecording and musical instruments, motion\npictures, photography, amusement and theme\nparks,\n\n15\n\ngaming casinos, sporting goods and sports\narenas, camping and recreational equipment,\ntoys and games, apparel, travel-related\nservices, automobiles, hotels and motels, and\nfast food and other restaurants) are subject\nto the risk that their products or services\nmay become obsolete quickly. The success of\nthese companies can depend heavily on\ndisposable household income and consumer\nspending. During periods of an expanding\neconomy, the consumer discretionary sector may\noutperform the consumer staples sector, but\nmay underperform when economic conditions\nworsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary\nsector can be significantly affected by\nseveral factors, including, without\nlimitation, the performance of domestic and\ninternational economies, exchange rates,\nchanging consumer preferences, demographics,\nmarketing campaigns, cyclical revenue\ngeneration, consumer confidence, commodity\nprice volatility, labor relations, interest\nrates, import and export controls, intense\ncompetition, technological developments and\ngovernment regulation. Risk of Investing in\nthe Consumer Goods Industry. Companies in the\nconsumer goods industry include companies\ninvolved in the design, production or\ndistribution of goods for consumers, including\nfood, household, home, personal and office\nproducts, clothing and textiles. The success\nof the consumer goods industry is tied closely\nto the performance of the domestic and\ninternational economy, interest rates,\nexchange rates, competition, consumer\nconfidence and consumer disposable income. The\nconsumer goods industry may be affected by\ntrends, marketing campaigns and other factors\naffecting consumer demand. Governmental\nregulation affecting the use of various food\nadditives may affect the profitability of\ncertain companies in the consumer goods\nindustry. Moreover, international events may\naffect food and beverage companies that derive\na substantial portion of their net income from\nforeign countries. In addition, tobacco\ncompanies may be adversely affected by new\nlaws, regulations and litigation. Many\nconsumer goods may be marketed globally, and\nconsumer goods companies may be affected by\nthe demand and market conditions in other\ncountries and regions. Companies in the\nconsumer goods industry may be subject to\nsevere competition, which may also have an\nadverse impact on their profitability. Changes\nin demographics and consumer preferences may\naffect the success of consumer products. Risk\nof Investing in the Consumer Services\nIndustry. The success of firms in the consumer\nservices industry and certain retailers\n(including food and beverage, general\nretailers, media, and travel and leisure) is\ntied closely to the performance of the\ndomestic and international economy, interest\nrates, exchange rates, competition and\nconsumer confidence. The consumer services\nindustry depends heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending.\nCompanies in the consumer services industry\nmay be subject to severe competition, which\nmay also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Companies in the consumer\nservices industry are facing increased\ngovernment and regulatory scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or regulatory\naction. Changes in demographics and consumer\npreferences may affect the success of consumer\nservice providers. Risk of Investing in the\nConsumer Staples Sector. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector may be adversely\naffected by changes in the global economy,\nconsumer spending, competition, demographics\nand consumer preferences, and production\nspending. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may also be affected by changes in\nglobal economic, environmental and political\nevents, economic conditions, the depletion of\nresources, and government regulation. For\ninstance, government regulations may affect\nthe permissibility of using various food\nadditives and production methods of companies\nthat make food products, which could affect\ncompany profitability. In addition, tobacco\ncompanies may be adversely affected by the\nadoption of proposed legislation and/or by\nlitigation. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector also may be subject to risks pertaining\nto the supply of, demand for and prices of raw\nmaterials. The prices of raw materials\nfluctuate in response to a number of factors,\nincluding, without limitation, changes in\ngovernment agricultural support programs,\nexchange rates, import and export controls,\nchanges in international agricultural and\ntrading policies, and seasonal and weather\nconditions. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Risk of Investing in the Energy\nSector. Companies in the energy sector are\nstrongly affected by the changes in and\nvolatility of global energy prices, energy\nsupply and demand, government regulations and\npolicies, energy production and conservation\nefforts, technological change, development of\nalternative energy sources, and other factors\nthat they cannot control. Energy companies may\nhave relatively high levels of debt and may be\nmore likely to restructure their businesses if\nthere are downturns in energy markets or in\nthe global economy. If an energy company in a\nFund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund\ncould lose all or a substantial portion of its\ninvestment. The energy sector is cyclical and\nis highly dependent on commodity prices.\nPrices and supplies of energy may fluctuate\nsignificantly over short and long periods of\ntime due to, among other things, national and\ninternational political changes, Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d )\npolicies, changes in relationships among OPEC\nmembers and between OPEC and oil-importing\nnations, the regulatory environment, taxation\npolicies, the enactment or cessation of trade\nsanctions, war or other geopolitical\nconflicts, and the economies of key energy-\nconsuming countries. Companies in the energy\nsector may be adversely affected by\n\n16\n\nterrorism, cyber incidents, natural disasters\nor other catastrophes. Companies in the energy\nsector are at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to predict and depend on a number\nof factors. The effect of these events or any\nrelated developments could be significant and\nmay have a severe adverse effect on the\nperformance of a Fund. Risk of Investing in\nthe Financials Sector. Companies in the\nfinancials sector include small, regional and\nmoney center banks, securities brokerage\nfirms, asset management companies, savings\nbanks and thrift institutions, specialty\nfinance companies ( e.g. , credit card,\nmortgage providers), insurance and insurance\nbrokerage firms, consumer finance firms,\nfinancial conglomerates and foreign banking\nand financial companies. Most financial\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which limits their\nactivities and may affect their ability to\nearn a profit from a given line of business.\nGovernment regulation may change frequently\nand may have significant adverse consequences\nfor companies in the financials sector,\nincluding effects not intended by the\nregulation. Direct governmental intervention\nin the operations of financial companies and\nfinancial markets may materially and adversely\naffect the companies in which a Fund invests,\nincluding legislation in many countries that\nmay increase government regulation,\nrepatriation and other intervention. The\nimpact of governmental intervention and\nlegislative changes on any individual\nfinancial company or on the financials sector\nas a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation\nof financial companies has been and continues\nto be subject to unprecedented volatility and\nmay be influenced by unpredictable factors,\nincluding interest rate risk and sovereign\ndebt default. Certain financial businesses are\nsubject to intense competitive pressures,\nincluding market share and price competition.\nFinancial companies in foreign countries are\nsubject to market-specific and general\nregulatory and interest rate concerns. In\nparticular, government regulation in certain\nforeign countries may include taxes and\ncontrols on interest rates, credit\navailability, minimum capital requirements,\nbans on short sales, limits on prices and\nrestrictions on currency transfers. In\naddition, companies in the financials sector\nmay be the targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or customer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe profitability of banks, savings and loan\nassociations and other financial companies is\nlargely dependent on the availability and cost\nof capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change; for\ninstance, when interest rates go up, the value\nof securities issued by many types of\ncompanies in the financials sector generally\ngoes down. In other words, financial companies\nmay be adversely affected in certain market\ncycles, including, without limitation, during\nperiods of rising interest rates, which may\nrestrict the availability and increase the\ncost of capital, and during periods of\ndeclining economic conditions, which may\ncause, among other things, credit losses due\nto financial difficulties of borrowers. In\naddition, general economic conditions are\nimportant to the operations of these\ncompanies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree,\n\n17\n\nincluding through swaps and other derivatives\nproducts, and who at times may be unable to\nmeet their obligations to the financial\nservices companies. Financial services\ncompanies may have significant exposure to the\nsame borrowers and counterparties, with the\nresult that a borrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s\ninability to meet its obligations to one\ncompany may affect other companies with\nexposure to the same borrower or counterparty.\nThis interconnectedness of risk, including\ncross-default risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products. Patents have a limited\nduration, and, upon expiration, other\ncompanies may market substantially similar \u201c\ngeneric \u201d products that are typically sold at\na lower price than the patented product, which\ncan cause the original developer of the\nproduct to lose market share and/or reduce the\nprice charged for the product, resulting in\nlower profits for the original developer. As a\nresult, the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. In addition, because the products\nand services of many companies in the\nhealthcare sector affect the health and well-\nbeing of many individuals, these companies are\nespecially susceptible to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and similar claims.\nHealthcare companies are subject to\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Many new products in the\nhealthcare sector may be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of obtaining such\napprovals may be long and costly, which can\nresult in increased development costs, delayed\ncost recovery and loss of competitive\nadvantage to the extent that rival companies\nhave developed competing products or\nprocedures, adversely affecting the company\u2019s\nrevenues and profitability. In other words,\ndelays in the regulatory approval process may\ndiminish the opportunity for a company to\nprofit from a new product or to bring a new\nproduct to market, which could have a material\nadverse effect on a company\u2019s business.\nHealthcare companies may also be strongly\naffected by scientific biotechnology or\ntechnological developments, and their products\nmay quickly become obsolete. Also, many\nhealthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Industrials Sector. The value\nof securities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply of and demand for both their\nspecific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by\n\n18\n\nchanges or trends in commodity prices, which\nmay be influenced by unpredictable factors.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component\nof the industrials sector, can be\nsignificantly affected by government spending\npolicies because companies involved in this\nindustry rely, to a significant extent, on\ngovernment demand for their products and\nservices. Thus, the financial condition of,\nand investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies, which\nare typically under pressure from efforts to\ncontrol government budgets. Transportation\nstocks, a component of the industrials sector,\nare cyclical and can be significantly affected\nby economic changes, fuel prices, labor\nrelations and insurance costs. Transportation\ncompanies in certain countries may also be\nsubject to significant government regulation\nand oversight, which may adversely affect\ntheir businesses. For example, commodity price\ndeclines and unit volume reductions resulting\nfrom an over-supply of materials used in the\nindustrials sector can adversely affect the\nsector. Furthermore, companies in the\nindustrials sector may be subject to liability\nfor environmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Materials Sector.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control,\namong other factors. Such risks may adversely\naffect the issuers to which a Fund has\nexposure. Companies in the materials sector\nare also at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in the Real\nEstate Industry. Companies in the real estate\nindustry include companies that invest in real\nestate, such as REITs, real estate holding and\noperating companies or real estate development\ncompanies (collectively, \u201c Real Estate\nCompanies \u201d ). Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies exposes investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly, as well as to\nrisks that relate specifically to the way in\nwhich Real Estate Companies are organized and\noperated. The real estate industry is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and developments, and characterized\nby intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies involves various risks. Some risks\nthat are specific to Real Estate Companies are\ndiscussed in greater detail below.\nConcentration Risk. Real Estate Companies may\nown a limited number of properties and\nconcentrate their investments in a particular\ngeographic region or property type. Economic\ndownturns affecting a particular region,\nindustry or property type may lead to a high\nvolume of defaults within a short period.\nDistressed Investment Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in distressed, defaulted\nor out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and\nimplementation by a Real Estate Company of\nloan modification and restructure programs\ninvolves a high degree of uncertainty. Even\nsuccessful implementation may still require\nadverse compromises and may not prevent\nbankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also\ninvest in other debt instruments that may\nbecome non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt or erratic\nprice fluctuations. In addition, real estate\nis relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements,\n\n19\n\nthird-party leasing commissions and other\ncapital expenditures, the income and ability\nof a Real Estate Company to make payments of\nany interest and principal on its debt\nsecurities will be adversely affected. Loan\nForeclosure Risk. Real Estate Companies may\nforeclose on loans that the Real Estate\nCompany originated and/or acquired.\nForeclosure may generate negative publicity\nfor the underlying property that affects its\nmarket value. In addition to the length and\nexpense of such proceedings, the validity of\nthe terms of the applicable loan may not be\nrecognized in foreclosure proceedings. Claims\nand defenses asserted by borrowers or other\nlenders may interfere with the enforcement of\nrights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel\nproceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also\ndelay resolution and limit the amount of\nrecovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate\nCompany even where the property underlying the\nloan is liquidated. Management Risk. Real\nEstate Companies are dependent upon management\nskills and may have limited financial\nresources. Real Estate Companies are generally\nnot diversified and may be subject to heavy\ncash flow dependency, default by borrowers and\nvoluntary liquidation. In addition,\ntransactions between Real Estate Companies and\ntheir affiliates may be subject to conflicts\nof interest, which may adversely affect a Real\nEstate Company\u2019s shareholders. A Real Estate\nCompany may also have joint venture\ninvestments in certain of its properties, and,\nconsequently, its ability to control decisions\nrelating to such properties may be limited.\nProperty Risk. Real Estate Companies may be\nsubject to risks relating to functional\nobsolescence or reduced desirability of\nproperties; extended vacancies due to economic\nconditions and tenant bankruptcies;\ncatastrophic events such as earthquakes,\nhurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or\ncondemnation losses. Real estate income and\nvalues also may be greatly affected by\ndemographic trends, such as population shifts\nor changes in consumer preferences and values,\nor increasing vacancies or declining rents\nresulting from legal, cultural, technological,\nglobal or local economic developments.\nRegulatory Risk. Real estate income and values\nmay be adversely affected by such factors as\napplicable domestic and foreign laws\n(including tax laws). Government actions, such\nas tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other commercial restrictions or\nenvironmental regulations, also may have a\nmajor impact on real estate income and values.\nIn addition, quarterly compliance with\nregulations limiting the proportion of asset\ntypes held by a U.S. REIT may force certain\nReal Estate Companies to liquidate or\nrestructure otherwise attractive investments.\nSome countries may not recognize REITs or\ncomparable structures as a viable form of real\nestate funds. Underlying Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies make investments in a variety\nof debt and equity instruments with varying\nrisk profiles. For instance, Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in debt instruments\nsecured by commercial property that have\nhigher risks of delinquency and foreclosure\nthan loans on single family homes due to a\nvariety of factors associated with commercial\nproperty, including the tie between income\navailable to service debt and productive use\nof the property. Real Estate Companies may\nalso invest in debt instruments and preferred\nequity that are junior in an issuer\u2019s capital\nstructure and that involve privately\nnegotiated structures. Subordinated debt\ninvestments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine\nloans, involve a greater credit risk of\ndefault due to the need to service more senior\ndebt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred\nequity investments involve a greater risk of\nloss than conventional debt financing due to\ntheir non-collateralized nature and\nsubordinated ranking. Investments in\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities may also\nbe junior in priority in the event of\nbankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments\nin senior loans may be effectively\nsubordinated if the senior loan is pledged as\ncollateral. The ability of a holder of junior\nclaims to proceed against a defaulting issuer\nis circumscribed by the terms of the\nparticular contractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nA REIT that successfully maintains its\nqualification may still become subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes, including\nexcise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage\nrecording, and transfer taxes, both directly\nand indirectly through its subsidiaries.\nBecause REITs often do not provide complete\ntax information until after the calendar year-\nend, a Fund may at times need to request\npermission to extend the deadline for issuing\nyour tax reporting statement or supplement the\ninformation otherwise provided to you. Risk of\nInvesting in the Residential and Residential-\nRelated REIT Sub-Industry. The Residential and\nResidential-Related REIT Sub-Industry consists\nof REITs with exposure to residential real\nestate and certain types of commercial real\nestate that complements residential real\nestate, including properties operated by\nhealthcare providers and self-storage\ncompanies. In addition to the risks related to\nREITs generally, investments in these REITs\nare subject to additional subsector-specific\nrisks.\n\n20\n\nResidential real estate may be affected by\nunique supply and demand factors that do not\napply to other REIT sub-sectors. In addition,\ncertain investors may already have exposure to\nresidential real estate through ownership of a\nprimary residence or direct ownership of\nrental property. The value of healthcare-\nfocused REITs may be affected by changes in\nfederal or state regulation of healthcare\nproviders and reimbursement rates to\nhealthcare providers under Medicare, Medicaid\nand other public or private health insurance\nplans. Unlike less specialized commercial real\nestate, when tenants vacate healthcare-related\nproperties, the ability of property management\nto find replacement tenants may be impaired by\nthe properties\u2019 specialized healthcare uses.\nInvestments in self-storage REITs are subject\nto changes in demand levels for self-storage.\nIn addition, self-storage operators may be\nliable for unplanned environmental and\nhazardous waste compliance costs associated\nwith operating self-storage locations. Risk of\nInvesting in Technology Companies. Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources\nand personnel. These companies may face rapid\nproduct obsolescence as well as unexpected\nrisks and costs related to new product\nintroduction and technological developments,\nsuch as artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning. Technology companies may be\nadversely affected by disruptions to supply\nchains and distribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners. They are\nheavily dependent on patent and other\nintellectual property rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect their profitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or legal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, actual or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects in their\nproducts and services, which may result in\nlawsuits, government enforcement actions and\nother remediation costs. Risk of Investing in\nthe Telecommunications Sector. The\ntelecommunications sector of a country\u2019s\neconomy is often subject to extensive\ngovernment regulation. The costs of complying\nwith governmental regulations, delays or\nfailure to receive required regulatory\napprovals, or the enactment of new regulatory\nrequirements may negatively affect the\nbusiness of telecommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the\ntelecommunications sector may experience\ndistressed cash flows due to the need to\ncommit substantial capital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may make the\nproducts and services of certain\ntelecommunications companies obsolete.\nFinally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the telecommunications\nsector may be particular targets of hacking\nand potential theft of proprietary or consumer\ninformation or disruptions in service, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on their\nbusinesses. Risk of Investing in the\nTransportation Industry. Companies in the\ntransportation industry may be adversely\naffected by changes in the economy, increases\nin fuel and operating costs, labor relations,\ntechnology developments, exchange rates,\ninsurance costs, industry competition and\ngovernment regulation. Companies in the\ntransportation industry are also affected by\nsevere weather events, mass casualty accidents\nor environmental catastrophes, acts of\nterrorism and other similar events that target\nor damage transportation infrastructure or\nvessels, war or risk of war, widespread\ndisruption of technology systems and\nincreasing equipment and operational costs.\nSuch global or regional events and conditions\nmay adversely affect the operations, financial\ncondition and liquidity of companies in the\ntransportation industry and cause insurance\npremiums to increase dramatically or result in\ninsurance coverage becoming unavailable for\ncertain business lines or assets. Securities\nof companies in the transportation industry\nare generally cyclical and occasionally\nsubject to sharp price movements. Risk of\nInvesting in the Utilities Sector. The\nutilities sector may be adversely affected by\nchanging commodity prices, government\nregulation stipulating rates charged by\nutilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax\nlaws, interest rate fluctuations and changes\nin the cost of providing specific utility\nservices. The utilities industry is also\nsubject to potential terrorist attacks,\nnatural disasters and severe weather\nconditions, as well as regulatory and\noperational burdens associated with the\noperation and maintenance of nuclear\nfacilities. Government regulators monitor and\ncontrol utility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility profits. Federal\nlegislation may facilitate the construction of\nelectric transmission lines not only by public\nutilities but also by independent transmission\ndevelopers, which could increase competition\nin the wholesale electricity markets. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate\nnuclear\n\n21\n\ngenerating facilities. Governmental\nauthorities may from time to time review\nexisting policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policy For the Funds, the Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for each\nFund\u2019s securities to BFA pursuant to the\nFunds' Proxy Voting Policy, and BFA has\nadopted policies and procedures (collectively,\nthe \u201c iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d )\ngoverning proxy voting by accounts managed by\nBFA, including the Funds. Under the iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote\nproxies related to Fund securities in the best\ninterests of a Fund and its shareholders. From\ntime to time, a vote may present a conflict\nbetween the interests of a Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, on the one hand, and those of\nBFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or\nBFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and\nprocedures that are designed to prevent undue\ninfluence on BFA\u2019s proxy voting activity that\nmight stem from any relationship between the\nissuer of a proxy (or any dissident\nshareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s affiliates, a Fund\nor a Fund\u2019s affiliates. Most conflicts are\nmanaged through a structural separation of\nBFA\u2019s Corporate Governance Group from BFA\u2019s\nemployees with sales and client\nresponsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains\nprocedures to ensure that all engagements with\ncorporate issuers or dissident shareholders\nare managed consistently and without regard to\nBFA\u2019s relationship with the issuer of the\nproxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Funds' portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ended\nJune 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon\nrequest, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on\nits website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of a Fund\u2019s next net\nasset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: A Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of a Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to a Fund to settle\npurchases of a Fund ( i.e. Deposit Securities)\nor that Authorized Participants would receive\nfrom a Fund to settle redemptions of a Fund (\ni.e. Fund Securities). These files are known\nas the Portfolio Composition File and the Fund\nData File (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The\nFiles are applicable for the next trading day\nand are provided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as\n\n22\n\ndescribed in the Custom Baskets section of\nthis SAI. As part of these discussions, these\nemployees may discuss with an Authorized\nParticipant or liquidity provider the\nsecurities a Fund is willing to accept for a\ncreation, and securities that a Fund will\nprovide on a redemption. BFA employees may\nalso discuss portfolio holdings-related\ninformation with broker/dealers, in connection\nwith settling a Fund\u2019s transactions, as may be\nnecessary to conduct business in the ordinary\ncourse in a manner consistent with the\ndisclosure in the Fund\u2019s current registration\nstatement. \u2022 Communications with Listing\nExchanges: From time to time, employees of BFA\nmay discuss portfolio holdings information\nwith the applicable primary listing exchange\nfor a Fund as needed to meet the exchange\nlisting standards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFunds, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Funds, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain a Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of a Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio- level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nConstruction and Maintenance of the Underlying\nIndexes Descriptions of the Underlying Indexes\nare provided below. With respect to certain\nunderlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA\nor its affiliates have held discussions with\nthe applicable index provider regarding their\nbusiness interest in licensing an index to\ntrack a particular market segment and conveyed\ninvestment concepts and strategies that could\nbe considered for the index. The index\nprovider designed and constituted such indices\nusing concepts conveyed by BFA or its\naffiliates. For certain of these indices, the\nrelevant fund may be the first or sole user of\nthe underlying index. In its sole discretion,\nthe index provider determines the composition\nof the securities and other instruments in\nsuch underlying index, the rebalance protocols\nof the underlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and other instruments in the\nunderlying index, and any updates to the\nmethodology. From time to time, BFA or its\naffiliates may also provide input relating to\npossible methodology changes of such\nunderlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\nThe Cohen & Steers Realty Majors Index Number\nof Components: approximately 30\n\n23\n\nIndex Methodology. The universe of U.S. REITs\nis first screened by the Index Provider for\nmarket capitalization and liquidity\nrequirements. To be eligible for inclusion, a\nREIT must have a minimum market capitalization\nof $500 million and a minimum of 600,000\nshares traded per month for the previous six\nmonths. The final 30 constituents are\ndetermined based on a review process. Criteria\nfor inclusion include the quality of the\nportfolio, property sector and geographic\ndiversification, strong management, sound\ncapital structure and a dominant position\nwithin a property sector. The Underlying Index\nis weighted according to the total free float\nadjusted market value of each constituent\u2019s\noutstanding shares and is adjusted quarterly\nso that no constituent represents more than 8%\nof the Underlying Index. Additionally, at the\nquarterly rebalance, the Underlying Index uses\na capping methodology to cap at 45% the\naggregate weight of all constituents that\nindividually exceed 4.5% of the index weight.\nBetween rebalances, constituent weights may\nexceed these constraints due to fluctuations\nin market value, corporate actions, or other\nevents that change the index composition. A\nconstituent will be removed from the\nUnderlying Index if its market capitalization\nhas fallen below $400 million or if the\nmonthly trading volume has fallen below\n500,000 shares per month for the previous six\nmonths. In order to prevent excessive\nturnover, the size and liquidity requirements\nare not as stringent during rebalancings as\nthey are for initial inclusion. Index\nMaintenance. The shares outstanding for each\nconstituent remain fixed between quarterly\nrebalancings, except in the event of certain\ncorporate actions. These include payment of\ndividends other than ordinary cash, stock\ndistributions, stock splits, reverse stock\nsplits, rights offerings, distributions,\nreorganizations, recapitalizations or similar\nevents with respect to the constituents.\nWeights are not adjusted for share issuance or\nrepurchases unless they change the total\nshares outstanding by more than 5%. In the\ncase of a merger or spin-off, the\nconstituent\u2019s weight is adjusted if the change\nin shares outstanding is more than 5%. In the\ncase of a spin-off, the new company is not\nautomatically included in the Underlying\nIndex. Whenever the shares outstanding are\nadjusted for any constituent, its new weight\nis subject to the 8% and 4.5%/45% limits. The\nUnderlying Index is a total return index and\ntherefore reflects the reinvestment of\ndividends. The Underlying Index is calculated\nand maintained by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) in\nconsultation with Cohen & Steers and\ndistributed in real time. The Dow Jones\nIndexes Component Selection Criteria.\nSecurities of companies listed on a major U.S.\nexchange (such as the New York Stock Exchange,\nInc. ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ), the NYSE American or the\nNasdaq) are considered for inclusion in the\nUnderlying Indexes, with the following general\nrules and exceptions. Non-common equity issues\nsuch as preferred stocks, convertible notes,\nwarrants, rights, closed-end funds, trust\nreceipts, limited liabilities companies,\nroyalty trusts, units, limited partnerships,\nOTC bulletin boards, pink sheet stocks,\ninvestment companies, fixed-dividend shares,\nmaster limited partnerships (MLPs), special\npurpose acquisition companies (SPACs), and\nstocks that do not meet certain minimum\nliquidity criteria generally are not eligible\nfor inclusion in the indexes. Component\nSelection Criteria Applicable to Dow Jones\nSubsector Index. The following index is\nreferred to herein as the \u201c Dow Jones\nSubsector Index \u201d : Dow Jones U.S. Financial\nServices Index. The Dow Jones Subsector Index\nincludes constituents of the Dow Jones U.S.\nIndex classified in the following subsectors:\nbanks, asset managers, consumer finance,\nspecialty finance, investment services, and\nmortgage finance. Issue Changes. Each\nUnderlying Index is reviewed and rebalanced\nquarterly to maintain accurate representation\nof the market segment represented by the\nUnderlying Index. Securities that are removed\nfrom an Underlying Index between\nreconstitution dates are not replaced. The\nonly additions between rebalancing dates are\nas a result of initial public offerings ( \u201c\nIPOs \u201d ) and spin-offs. The Dow Jones\nSubsector Indexes will consider securities\nthat change sector classifications for\ninclusion or removal based on the eligibility\nof the resulting subsector classification at\nthe time of the change. Components of the Dow\nJones U.S. Select Dividend Index are reviewed\nquarterly and the index is rebalanced\nannually. The only additions between\nrebalancing dates are as a result of spin-\noffs. Ineligible spin-offs are removed after\nat least one day of regular way trading. Index\nMaintenance. Maintaining the Underlying\nIndexes includes monitoring and completing the\nadjustments for additions and deletions to\neach Underlying Index, share changes, stock\nsplits, stock dividends, and stock price\nadjustments due to restructuring and spin-\noffs. Certain Underlying Indexes limit\ncomponent securities to a maximum market\ncapitalization. The Dow Jones U.S. Select\nDividend Index limits the weighting in the\nindex of each component security to no greater\nthan 10% of the Underlying Index.\n\n24\n\nWeighting. The component stocks are weighted\naccording to the total value of their\noutstanding shares. The impact of a\ncomponent\u2019s price change is proportional to\nthe issue\u2019s total market value, which is the\nshare price multiplied by the number of shares\noutstanding. Each Underlying Index is adjusted\nto reflect changes in capitalization resulting\nfrom mergers, acquisitions, stock rights,\nsubstitutions and other capital events. Each\nof the Underlying Indexes (except the Dow\nJones U.S. Select Dividend Index) as described\nbelow, is a free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization-weighted index, so the impact\nof a component\u2019s price change is proportional\nto the component\u2019s free float-adjusted market\nvalue, which is the share price multiplied by\nthe number of float-adjusted shares\noutstanding. SPDJI defines the free float of a\nsecurity as the proportion of shares\noutstanding that are deemed to be available\nfor purchase in the public equity markets by\ninvestors. In practice, limitations on free\nfloat available to investors include: cross\nownership (shares that are owned by other\ncompanies), ownership by governments (central\nor municipal) or their agencies, certain\nsubstantial levels of private ownership (by\nindividuals, families or charitable trusts and\nfoundations), and restricted shares. Under\nSPDJI's free float adjustment methodology, a\ncompany\u2019s outstanding shares are adjusted if,\nand only if, an entity in any of the four\nqualified categories listed above owns 5% or\nmore of the company. The company\u2019s shares will\nnot be adjusted if the block ownership is less\nthan 5%. A constituent\u2019s inclusion factor is\nequal to its estimated percentage of free\nfloat shares outstanding. For example, a\nconstituent security with a free float of 67%\nwill be included in the index at 67% of its\nmarket capitalization. However, a company\u2019s\noutstanding shares are not adjusted by\ninstitutional investors\u2019 holdings, which\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following\ncategories: depositary banks; pension funds;\nmutual funds, ETF providers, investment funds,\nand asset managers; investment funds of\ninsurance companies; and independent\nfoundations not associated with the company.\nIndex Availability. The Underlying Indexes are\ncalculated continuously and are available from\nmajor data vendors.

Dow Jones U.S. Financial Services\nIndex Number of Components: approximately 104\nIndex Description. The Dow Jones U.S.\nFinancial Services Index is a subset of the\nDow Jones U.S. Index. The Underlying Index\nincludes components of the following\nsubsectors in the Dow Jones U.S. Index: banks,\nasset managers, consumer finance, specialty\nfinance, investment services and mortgage\nfinance. Dow Jones U.S. Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 1,075 Index\nDescription. The Dow Jones U.S. Index is a\nbroad-based index representative of the total\nmarket for U.S. equity securities. The\nUnderlying Index represents approximately the\ntop 95% of the market capitalization of listed\nU.S. equities. Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend\nIndex Number of Components: approximately 99\nIndex Description. The Dow Jones U.S. Select\nDividend Index measures the performance of the\nU.S.'s leading stocks by dividend yield. The\nUnderlying Index is comprised of 100 of the\nhighest dividend-yielding securities\n(excluding REITs) in the Dow Jones U.S. Index.\nTo be included in the Underlying Index, each\nsecurity (i) must have dividend-per-share\ngreater than or equal to its five-year average\ndividend-per-share; (ii) must have a five-year\naverage dividend coverage ratio of greater\nthan or equal to 167%; (iii) must have a\nminimum three-month average daily trading\nvolume of 200,000 shares (100,000 shares for\ncurrent constituents); (iv) must have paid\ndividends in each of the previous five years;\n(v) must have a non-negative trailing 12-month\nearnings-per-share and (vi) must have a float-\nadjusted market cap of at least $3 billion ($2\nbillion for current constituents).

The FTSE Nareit \u00ae US Real Estate\nIndex Series ( \u201c FTSE Nareit Indexes \u201d ) is\nprimarily rule-based, but is also monitored by\nthe FTSE Nareit Index Advisory Committee. All\ntax-qualified REITs that are listed on the\nNYSE or the Nasdaq are eligible for inclusion\nin the FTSE Nareit Indexes. Potential\nconstituents for the FTSE Nareit Equity REITs\nIndex are determined by sector classifications\nof constituents in the FTSE Nareit Composite\nIndex. The FTSE Nareit Indexes are reviewed\nfor changes on a quarterly basis in March,\nJune, September and December for companies\nwhich do not qualify for fast entry, but which\nmeet the criteria for eligible securities set\nout in the index rules. The review is based on\ndata at the close of business on the Monday 4\nweeks prior to the review effective date. The\nFTSE Nareit Index Advisory Committee meets\nquarterly, in March, June, September and\nDecember or more frequently, if required. When\ncalculating index component weights, component\ncompanies\u2019 shares are adjusted for available\nfree float. In general, shares held by\ngovernments, corporations, strategic partners,\nor other control groups are excluded from a\nconstituent company\u2019s outstanding shares. The\nFTSE Nareit Composite Index and FTSE Nareit\nEquity REITs Index are reviewed for changes in\nfree float on a quarterly basis, and\nimplementation of any changes to these\nindexes, and potentially the FTSE Nareit\nIndexes, occur after the close of business on\nthe third Friday in March, June, September or\nDecember. Index Maintenance. FTSE is\nresponsible for the daily operation of the\nFTSE Nareit Indexes. FTSE will maintain\nrecords of the market capitalization of all\nconstituents, and will make changes to the\nconstituents and their weightings in\naccordance with index rules. FTSE will also\ncarry out the periodic company reviews of the\nFTSE Nareit Indexes and implement the\nresulting constituent changes as required by\nindex rules. Issue Changes. A company will be\nadded to the FTSE Nareit Equity REITs Index at\nthe periodic review if its full market\ncapitalization is greater than $100 million\n(before the application of any free float\nmarket adjustments), meets liquidity test in\nDecember, has at least 75 percent of their\ntotal assets invested in qualifying real\nestate assets, and has a free float greater\nthan 5%. A company in the FTSE Nareit Equity\nREITs Index will be deleted at the periodic\nreview if its market capitalization is below\n$100 million or fails the four screens. Where\na company, whether an existing constituent or\nnot, undertakes an Initial Public Offering of\na new equity security, that security will be\neligible for fast entry inclusion to the FTSE\nNareit Index Series if its full market\ncapitalization using the closing price on the\nfirst day of trading is greater than the\nmarket capitalization of the company ranked 10\nth position or higher in the FTSE Nareit Real\nEstate 50 Index, before the application of\nindividual constituent investability\nweightings. New issues of companies that do\nnot qualify for \u201c Fast Entry \u201d but meet the\ncriteria for eligible securities and have been\nlisted for over 20 business trading days will\nbe eligible for inclusion in the FTSE Nareit\nEquity REITs Index. The review is based on\ndata at the close of business on the Monday 4\nweeks prior to the review effective date. The\nchanges will be effective after the close of\nbusiness on the third Friday in March, June,\nSeptember and December. If a constituent is\ndelisted, or ceases to have a firm quotation,\nor is subject to a takeover offer which has\nbeen declared wholly unconditional, it will be\nremoved from the indexes of which it is a\nconstituent. Index Availability. The FTSE\nNareit Indexes are calculated continuously\nduring normal trading hours of the NYSE and\nNasdaq, and are closed on U.S. holidays.\nExchange Rates and Pricing.

A security\u2019s\nliquidity score is based on its average\nmonthly trading volume in U.S. dollars.\nAmerican Depositary Receipts ( \u201c ADRs \u201d ),\nAmerican Depositary Shares, fixed-dividend\nshares, convertible notes, warrants, rights,\nlimited partnerships, limited liability\ncompanies, bank holding companies and royalty\nand statutory trusts are not eligible for\ninclusion in the US Market Extended Index.\nExcept for Morningstar \u00ae US Dividend and\nBuyback Index, Morningstar Dividend Yield\nFocus Index, and Morningstar US Dividend\nGrowth Index, the Morningstar Underlying\nIndexes are part of the Morningstar US Style\nIndex family, which is based on the same\nmethodology as the well-known Morningstar\nStyle Box \u2122 . The Morningstar Style Box \u2122\nclassification of each stock relies on\nprospective financial performance metrics \u2013\nexpressed as a yield ( i.e. , revenue yield,\ncash flow yield, dividend yield, and book\nvalue yield) and the per-share growth rate of\neach such metric \u2013 as derived from\nMorningstar\u2019s proprietary models, and (when\navailable) the Institutional Brokers Estimate\nSystem ( \u201c IBES \u201d ) forecast of each stock\u2019s\ncurrent year earnings per share and the IBES\nmedian long-term earnings growth forecast. The\nMorningstar Underlying Indexes are governed by\ntransparent, objective rules for security\nselection, exclusion, rebalancing, and\nadjustments for corporate actions. Morningstar\nmakes no subjective determinations related to\nindex composition. Market Capitalization\nBands. For the Morningstar US Style Index\nfamily, the Index Provider selects stocks for\neach Underlying Index by size in descending\norder. The stocks that, in aggregate, account\nfor 69% of the total market capitalization of\nthe investable universe are assigned to the\nlarge-cap band. Those stocks that fall between\nthe 69% and 71% of the capitalization of the\ninvestable universe may be classified as\nlarge-cap or mid-cap, depending on their\nclassification at the previous reconstitution\ndate. The stocks that fall between 71% and\n89.5% of the investable universe are assigned\nto the mid-cap band. The stocks that fall\nbetween 89.5% and 90.5% of the capitalization\nof the investable universe may be classified\nas mid-cap or small-cap, depending on their\nclassification at the previous reconstitution\ndate. The stocks that fall between 90.5% and\n99.45% of the capitalization of the investable\nuniverse are assigned to the small-cap\nextended band. Issue Changes. Securities are\nadded or deleted from each index based on\nrules outlined for security selection,\nexclusion, rebalancing, and adjustments for\ncorporate actions as set forth in the\nMorningstar Index Rulebook. Morningstar makes\nno subjective determinations related to index\ncomposition. Index Maintenance.

The Morningstar \u00ae US Dividend and\nBuyback Index SM is designed to provide\nexposure to U.S.- based companies that return\ncapital to shareholders through either\ndividend payments or share buybacks. The\nUnderlying Index consists of companies with\nthe largest dividend and buyback programs in\nthe market measured by adjusted shareholder\nyield, as determined by Morningstar.\nMorningstar\u2019s adjusted shareholder yield\ncalculation is described below. The Underlying\nIndex is a subset of the Morningstar US Market\nIndex (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), which is a\nbroad market index that represents\napproximately 97% of the market capitalization\nof publicly traded U.S. stocks. Eligibility.\nThe following rules are used for the initial\nconstituent selection and reconstitution: (1)\na security must be a member of the Morningstar\nUS Market Index; (2) security must pay a\ndividend or repurchase shares resulting in a\nnet share reduction. Total shareholder yield\nmust exceed 0.1%. Morningstar defines total\nshareholder yield as the sum of the trailing\n12 month dividend yield and the trailing 2\nyear buyback yield (annualized). Morningstar\ndefines the trailing 12 month dividend yield\nas the sum of corporate action-adjusted\ndividends per-share paid in the 12 months\nbefore the data cutoff date (the last trading\nday of the month prior to the rebalancing\ndate), divided by the share price on the\ncutoff date. Additionally, Morningstar defines\nthe trailing 2 year buyback yield as the sum\nof net cash flow from share issuance from the\neight most recent company quarterly reports\navailable on the data cutoff date, divided by\n2, divided by market capitalization of the\ncompany. (3) companies in the top 5% of total\nshareholder yield are removed; (4) the\nremaining companies are ranked by adjusted\nshareholder yield. Morningstar defines\nadjusted shareholder yield as the weighted\naverage sum of the trailing 12 month dividend\nyield z-score and trailing 2 year buyback\nyield (annualized) z-score, with 75% and 25%\nweights, respectively. Z-score represents the\nnumber of standard deviations by which the\ndata points in the sample differ from the\nmean; (5) constituent securities are selected\nby decreasing order of adjusted shareholder\nyield until 50% coverage of total shareholder\npayout dollars (total shareholder yield\nmultiplied by the float-adjusted market\ncapitalization of the company as of the cutoff\ndate) of the Parent Index is reached.\nSecurities with negative total shareholder\nyield are not included in the aggregate\ncalculation; (6) the Underlying Index is\nweighted by total shareholder payout dollars;\n(7) a 4.9% weight cap is applied on individual\nnames to maintain sufficient diversification.\nThe weight capping algorithm will preserve,\nstarting with the smallest security, the\nrelative weights between as many constituents\nas possible while enforcing the weight cap;\n(8) sector weights are constrained at within\n5% (positive or negative) of the Parent Index;\nand. (9) the Underlying Index is reconstituted\nannually, rebalanced quarterly and calculated\nas of the cutoff date; at rebalance, the\nweights of the Underlying Index are adjusted\nfor updated free-float, shares outstanding,\nand total shareholder yield data. Morningstar\n\u00ae US Dividend Growth Index SM Number of\nComponents: approximately 419 Index\nDescription. The Morningstar US Dividend\nGrowth Index, the Underlying Index, is a\ndividend dollars weighted index that seeks to\nmeasure the performance of U.S. companies\nselected based on a consistent history of\ngrowing dividends. The Underlying Index is a\nsubset of the Morningstar US Market Index,\nwhich is a broad market index that represents\napproximately 97% of the market capitalization\nof publicly traded U.S. stocks. Eligible\ncompanies must pay a qualified\n\n30\n\ndividend, must have at least five years of\nuninterrupted annual dividend growth and their\nearnings payout ratio must be less than 75%.\nCompanies that are in the top decile based on\ndividend yield are excluded from the\nUnderlying Index prior to the dividend growth\nand payout ratio screens. Index Methodology.\nThe Underlying Index methodology is as\nfollows: (1) a security must be a member of\nthe Morningstar US Market Index; (2) security\nmust pay a qualified dividend ( e.g. , REITs\nare excluded); (3) top decile yield payers are\nexcluded; (4.1) apply dividend growth screen:\nmust be currently paying dividends and have at\nleast five years of uninterrupted annual\ndividend growth; dividend growth condition is\nconsidered met if either the current\nannualized dividend rate or the trailing\ntwelve months aggregated dividend increased\nfrom the previous to the current\nreconstitution date; (4.2) spinoff exception\nto growth rule: for a current constituent of\nthe index, the requirement to raise dividend\nyear-over-year to remain in the index after\nreconstitution will be waived if the\nconstituent completed a spin-off in the\npreceding twelve months; any publicly trading\nspun-off entity of a current constituent will\nbe immediately included in the index, but it\nwill have to start increasing its dividend\nstarting with the year following the next\nreconstitution to remain in the index. The\ncurrent constituent will not require dividend\ngrowth in the spin-off year, where \u201c year \u201d\nmeans the twelve-month period between annual\nindex reconstitutions; (4.3) share repurchase\nexception to growth rule: for a current\nconstituent of the index, the requirement to\nraise dividend year-over-year to remain in the\nindex after reconstitution will be waived if\nthe constituent kept the dividend constant and\nexecuted share repurchases in the preceding\ntwelve months resulting in net decrease in its\nshares outstanding; this exception does not\napply to constituents that decreased their\ndividend; (5) apply growth sustainability\nscreen: payout ratio must be less than 75%,\nand must have positive consensus earnings\nforecast. Payout ratio is forward looking and\nis calculated by the forward 12 month\nindicated dividend divided by the forward 12\nmonth consensus earnings forecast; (6) weight\nby dividend dollars (float adjusted common\nshares multiplied by the current annualized\ndividend rate per share); (7) apply 3% weight\ncap on individual names to maintain sufficient\ndiversification. The weight capping algorithm\nwill preserve, starting with the smallest\nsecurity, the relative weights between as many\nconstituents as possible while enforcing the\nweight cap; and (8) the index is reconstituted\nannually and rebalanced quarterly; at\nrebalance, index constituent list is not\naltered, but the weights of the constituents\nare re-adjusted back to the dividend dollar\nweighting. The MSCI Indexes The MSCI indexes\nwere founded in 1969 by Capital International\nS.A. as the first international performance\nbenchmarks constructed to facilitate accurate\ncomparison of world markets. The MSCI single\ncountry standard equity indexes have covered\nthe world's developed markets since 1969 and\nin 1987 MSCI commenced coverage of emerging\nmarkets. Local stock exchanges traditionally\ncalculated their own indexes which were\ngenerally not comparable with one another due\nto differences in the representation of the\nlocal market, mathematical formulas, base\ndates and methods of adjusting for capital\nchanges. MSCI, however, applies the same\ncalculation methodology to all markets for all\nsingle country standard equity indexes, both\ndeveloped and emerging.

The\nMSCI KLD 400 Social Index is a free float-\nadjusted market capitalization weighted index\ndesigned to provide exposure to U.S. companies\nthat have positive environmental, social and\ngovernance ( \u201c ESG \u201d ) characteristics. As of\nApril 30, 2024, the Underlying Index consisted\nof 401 securities identified by MSCI\n\n31\n\nfrom the universe of companies included in the\nMSCI USA IMI Index, which consists of the\nlargest NYSE and Nasdaq listed U.S. equities\nranked by investable market capitalization\n(after the application of any investability\nweightings). MSCI analyzes each eligible\ncompany\u2019s ESG performance using proprietary\nratings covering environmental, social, and\ngovernance criteria. MSCI seeks to include in\nthe Underlying Index companies with high ESG\nratings relative to their sector peers and in\nrelation to the broader market. When selecting\ncompanies for the Underlying Index, MSCI also\nconsiders market capitalization and liquidity.\nCompanies that MSCI determines have\nsignificant involvement in the following\nbusinesses are not eligible for the Underlying\nIndex: fossil fuel extraction, fossil fuel\nreserve ownership, thermal coal mining,\nunconventional oil and gas extraction, thermal\ncoal -based power generation, alcohol,\ntobacco, gambling, civilian firearms, nuclear\npower, controversial weapons, nuclear weapons,\nconventional weapons, adult entertainment and\ngenetically modified organisms. Index\nMaintenance. The composition of the Underlying\nIndex is reviewed on a quarterly basis.\nCompanies can be added to the Underlying Index\nonly at regular index reviews. Current index\nconstituents are reviewed to determine if any\nshould be removed due to ESG performance. In\naddition, if a constituent is removed from the\nMSCI USA IMI Index as a result of the index\nreview, it will be simultaneously removed from\nthe Underlying Index. The deleted companies\nare replaced with eligible companies taking\ninto account size-segment and sector\nrepresentation. The Underlying Index will be\nrestored to 400 companies at each index\nreview. Maintaining the Underlying Index\nincludes monitoring and completing the\nadjustments for company additions and\nremovals, stock splits, stock dividends, float\nchanges and stock price adjustments due to\nrestructurings, spin-offs and other corporate\nactions. New additions to the MSCI USA IMI\nIndex due to corporate events will not be\nadded simultaneously to the Underlying Index,\nbut will be considered for inclusion at the\nfollowing index review. However, companies\ndeleted from the MSCI USA IMI Index between\nindex reviews are also deleted at the same\ntime from the Underlying Index. When the\nnumber of securities in the Underlying Index\nfalls below 400 due to corporate events, no\nadditions will be made to restore the number\nof constituents to 400 until the next\nquarterly index review. Index Availability.\nThe Underlying Index is calculated\ncontinuously and is available from major data\nvendors. Calculation Methodology. The Fund\nutilizes the Underlying Index calculated with\ngross dividends reinvested. The use of gross\ndividends reflects the assumed reinvestment of\nthe entire dividend distributed to holders of\nthe underlying stock, without any adjustment\nfor taxes or withholding. The Index is\nrebalanced on a quarterly basis coinciding\nwith the regular index review of the MSCI\nGlobal Investable Market Indexes. MSCI USA\nExtended ESG Select Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 177 Component\nSelection Criteria and Index Description. The\nUnderlying Index is an optimized index\ndesigned to measure the equity performance of\nU.S. companies that have ESG characteristics,\nwhile exhibiting risk and return\ncharacteristics similar to the MSCI USA Index.\nAs of April 30, 2024, the Underlying Index\nconsisted of 177 securities included in the\nMSCI USA Index. MSCI evaluates each eligible\ncompany\u2019s ESG performance using standardized\ncriteria and assigns an \u201c overall rating \u201d to\neach company. ESG scores are normalized and\nfactored into the optimization process.\nOptimization is a quantitative process that\nconsiders the market capitalization weights\nfrom the MSCI USA Index, ESG scores, and\nadditional optimization constraints to select\nand weigh the constituents in the Underlying\nIndex. Normalization of the ESG scores allows\nthe optimization to assess each score in the\ncontext of the overall distribution of the ESG\nscores. The selection process is designed so\nthat companies with relatively high overall\nratings have a higher representation in the\nUnderlying Index than in the MSCI USA Index.\nCompanies with relatively low overall ratings\nhave a lower representation in the Underlying\nIndex than in the MSCI USA Index. Exceptions\nmay result from the Underlying Index\u2019s\nobjective of having risk and return\ncharacteristics similar to those of the MSCI\nUSA Index. The Underlying Index constituents\nare selected from the MSCI USA Index, which is\nmade up of securities of large-capitalization\nand mid-capitalization U.S. companies. The\nIndex Provider excludes securities of\ncompanies involved in the business of tobacco,\nalcohol, gambling, nuclear power and weapons,\nfossil fuel extraction, thermal coal and\nunconventional oil and gas businesses ( e.g. ,\nthermal coal extraction and generation or oil\nsands extraction), companies involved with\nconventional and controversial weapons,\nproducers and major retailers of civilian\nfirearms, as well as companies involved in\n\n32\n\nvery severe business controversies. The Index\nProvider defines a controversy as an instance\nor ongoing situation in which company\noperations and/or products allegedly have a\nnegative environmental, social and/or\ngovernance impact. Each controversy case is\nassessed for the severity of its impact on\nsociety. The Index Provider generally\nclassifies companies as \u201c involved \u201d in a\nparticular business based on revenue or\npercentage of revenue thresholds ( e.g. , 10%)\nfor certain products and activities in an\nexcluded industry. The securities of certain\ncompanies will be excluded regardless of\nrevenue measures ( e.g. , all companies\ninvolved in the manufacturing of controversial\nweapons are excluded). The Underlying Index\ngenerally follows the same index methodology\nas the MSCI USA ESG Select Index, except that\nit applies an additional ineligibility\ncriteria for retailers of civilian firearms\n(which is a revenue-threshold based\nclassification). Existing constituents are\nrequired to have an MSCI ESG Controversies\nScore above 0 to remain in the index, while\ncompanies that are currently not constituents\nof the index are required to have an MSCI ESG\nControversies Score above 2 to be eligible for\ninclusion. To maintain risk and return\ncharacteristics similar to the MSCI USA Index,\nthe universe of eligible companies are\noptimized using parameters for predicted\ntracking error (1.8%) relative to the parent\nindex, maximum (5%) and minimum (0.1%)\nconstituent weight relative to the parent\nindex, sector variation from the parent index\n(+/-3%), turnover and other factors. Since\nconstituent selection and weights are\ndetermined using optimization, the Underlying\nIndex is not capitalization weighted. Index\nMaintenance. The composition of the Underlying\nIndex is reviewed on a quarterly basis.\nCompanies can only be added to the Underlying\nIndex at regular index reviews. Current index\nconstituents are reviewed to determine if any\nof them should be removed using the\noptimization described above. At the quarterly\nindex reviews, companies with ESG\nControversies Scores below are removed. The\nUnderlying Index is optimized on a quarterly\nbasis coinciding with the regular index\nreviews of the MSCI Global Investable Market\nIndexes. Changes are effective at the\nbeginning of March, June, September and\nDecember. Maintaining the Underlying Index\nincludes monitoring and completing the\nadjustments for company additions and\nremovals, stock splits, stock dividends, float\nchanges and stock price adjustments due to\nrestructurings, spin-offs and other corporate\nactions. Companies deleted from the MSCI USA\nIndex between quarterly index reviews due to\ncorporate events maintenance are\nsimultaneously deleted from the Underlying\nIndex. Index Availability. The MSCI USA\nExtended ESG Select Index is calculated\ncontinuously and is available from major data\nvendors. Calculation Methodology. The Fund\nutilizes the Underlying Index calculated with\ngross dividends reinvested. The use of gross\ndividends reflects the assumed reinvestment of\nthe entire dividend distributed to holders of\nthe underlying stock, without any adjustment\nfor taxes or withholding. The Index is\nrebalanced on a quarterly basis coinciding\nwith the regular Index Review of the MSCI\nGlobal Investable Market Indexes.

The Russell Indexes Component\nSelection Criteria. The securities in the\nRussell indexes (sometimes referred to as the\n\u201c components \u201d ) are reviewed and\nreconstituted annually, typically after the\nclose on the last Friday in June to reflect\nchanges in the marketplace. The Russell 1000 \u00ae\nIndex is a subset of the Russell 3000 \u00ae Index.\nThe Russell 3000 \u00ae Index measures the\nperformance of approximately the largest 3,000\nU.S. companies, representing approximately 98%\nof the investable U.S. equity market. The\nRussell 3000 \u00ae Index is constructed to provide\na comprehensive, unbiased, and stable\nbarometer of the broad market and is\ncompletely reconstituted annually, typically\nafter the close on the last Friday in June, to\nensure new and growing equities are included.\nThe starting universe for the Russell 3000 \u00ae\nIndex includes all issuers listed on a U.S.\nExchange that are either U.S. incorporated or\nincorporated in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions\nas Benefit-Driven Incorporations (typically\ntax benefit incorporations), subject to the\nfollowing rules and exceptions: \u2022 stocks must\ntrade at or above $1.00 on the last business\nday of August to be eligible for inclusion. If\na stock in the index has a price lower than\n$1, it can remain in the index if the average\nprice for the month is greater than $1;\n\n33\n\n\u2022 for ranking and membership determination,\nall common share classes for a single company\nare combined to determine total market\ncapitalization; \u2022 in cases where there are\nmultiple common stock share classes and the\nshare classes act independently of each other,\neach class is considered for inclusion\nseparately; and \u2022 also excluded are preferred\nand convertible preferred stock, participating\npreferred stock, redeemable shares, warrants\nand rights, trust receipts, royalty trusts,\nlimited liability issuers, OTC bulletin boards\nand pink sheet stocks, mutual funds, limited\npartnerships, and foreign stocks. All eligible\nsecurities are sorted by decreasing total\nmarket capitalization to determine index\neligibility. The Russell 1000 Index is\nconstructed to provide a comprehensive and\nunbiased barometer for the large- and mid-\ncapitalization segments of the investable U.S.\nequity market. It is a float-adjusted\ncapitalization-weighted index consisting\napproximately 1000 of the largest issuers in\nthe Russell 3000 Index. For the Russell 3000 \u00ae\nIndex and the Russell 1000 \u00ae Index, the\nweights of component issuers are adjusted\nbased on available float-weighted\ncapitalization according to the market value\nof their available outstanding shares. The\nimpact of a component security\u2019s price change\nis proportional to the issuer\u2019s total market\nvalue, which is the share price times the\nnumber of shares available. Each Russell Index\nis adjusted to reflect changes in\ncapitalization resulting from mergers,\nacquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and\nother capital events. Frank Russell Company\nuses a probability measure to assign stocks to\nthe growth and value style indexes. The\nprobability measure is used to indicate the\ndegree of certainty that a stock is value or\ngrowth, based on three fundamental indicators:\nrelative price-to-book ratio, Institutional\nBrokers\u2019 Estimate System forecast medium-term\ngrowth (2 years) and sales per share\nhistorical growth (5 years). This method\nallows stocks to be represented as having both\ngrowth and value characteristics, while\npreserving the additive nature of the indexes.\nAs a result, a stock may be a component of a\nRussell growth style index and also a\ncomponent of the corresponding value style\nindex, although the stock would likely have a\ndifferent weight in each index. Issue Changes.\nSecurities that leave the Russell Indexes\nbetween reconstitution dates are not replaced.\nThus, the number of securities in the\ninvestments over the year will fluctuate\naccording to corporate activity. When a stock\nis acquired, delisted or moves to the pink\nsheets or OTC bulletin boards, the stock is\ndeleted from the relevant indexes. When\nacquisitions or mergers take place, the\nstock\u2019s capitalization moves to the acquiring\nstock, hence, mergers have no effect on index\ntotal capitalization if the acquiring stock is\npart of the index. The only additions between\nreconstitution dates are as a result of spin-\noffs and IPOs. Index Maintenance. Maintaining\nthe Russell indexes includes monitoring and\ncompleting the adjustments for company\nadditions and deletions, share changes, stock\nsplits, stock dividends, and stock price\nadjustments due to restructuring and spin-offs\nand quarterly initial public offerings. In\naddition, significant share capital changes\nare made at month-end. The divisor is adjusted\nfor all changes in company market value to\nleave the value of the investments unaffected.\nAll divisor adjustments are made after the\nclose of trading and after the calculation of\nthe closing value of the Russell indexes.\nIndex Availability. The Russell indexes are\ncalculated continuously and are available from\nmajor data vendors. Russell 1000 Basic\nMaterials RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 39 Index\nDescription.

SPDJI\u2019s various Index\nCommittees are responsible for the overall\nmanagement of SPDJI\u2019s indices ( \u201c S&P DJI\nIndices \u201d ). Issuers ( i.e. , the \u201c components\n\u201d ) selected for the S&P U.S. indexes\nrepresent a broad range of industry segments\nwithin the U.S. economy. The starting universe\nof publicly traded U.S. issuers classified by\nthe Global Industry Classification Standard (\n\u201c GICS \u00ae \u201d ) must be a member of the S&P Total\nMarket Index (TMI). The issuers are screened\nto eliminate Business development companies\n(BDCs), preferred stock, limited partnerships\n(LPs), convertible preferred stock, master\nlimited partnerships (MLPs), unit trusts,\nlimited liability companies (LLCs), equity\nwarrants, closed-end funds, convertible bonds,\nETFs, investment trusts, ETNs, rights, royalty\ntrusts, American depositary receipts (ADRs),\nand special purpose acquisition companies\n(SPACs). The stock of each constituent must\ntrade on either the NYSE, the NYSE American,\nCboe or on Nasdaq. Additionally, only one\nshare class per constituent will be included\nin an Index. The share class is selected by\nSPDJI and is generally defined as the largest,\nmost liquid share class. The following\ncriteria are then analyzed to determine an\nissuer\u2019s eligibility for inclusion in the S&P\nDJI Indexes: (i) where the issuers are\ndomiciled; (ii) the exchange listing; (iii)\nthe organizational structure; (iv) share type;\n(v) liquidity; and (vi) investable weight\nfactor (the available float shares divided by\ntotal shares outstanding).\n\n36\n\nThe S&P DJI\u2019s Indices are capitalization-\nweighted, based on the following formula:\nnumber of outstanding shares of a constituent\n(as determined by the float-adjusted market\ncapitalization using SPDJI\u2019s methodology)\nmultiplied by the constituent\u2019s share price.\nThe market capitalizations of an Index\u2019s\ncomponents are adjusted to reflect changes in\ncapitalization resulting from mergers,\nacquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and\nother capital events. The market\ncapitalizations of an Index\u2019s constituent are\nadjusted for all strategic holdings, including\nprivate, corporate, and government holdings.\nIndex Eligibility. To qualify for membership\nin the index, at each quarterly rebalancing, a\nstock must be a member of the S&P Total Market\nIndex (the \u201c TMI \u201d ) and classified by S&P DJI\nIndices as a primary sub-industry stock ( \u201c\nprimary stock \u201d ) for its index. Further,\neligible stocks must meet at least one of the\nfollowing float-adjusted market capitalization\n( \u201c FMC \u201d ) and float-adjusted liquidity ratio\n( \u201c FALR \u201d ) requirements determined by S&P\nDJI Indices: a. Be a current constituent, have\nan FMC greater than or equal to US$ 300\nmillion, and have an FALR greater than or\nequal to 50%. b. Have an FMC greater than or\nequal to US$ 500 million and an FALR greater\nthan or equal to 90%. c. Have an FMC greater\nthan or equal to US$ 400 million and an FALR\ngreater than or equal to 150%. However,\nminimum FMC requirements may be relaxed for\neach S&P Select Industry FMC Index to ensure\nthat there are at least 22 stocks in each\nindex as of each rebalancing effective date.\nIssue Changes. General oversight\nresponsibility for the S&P DJI Indices,\nincluding overall policy guidelines and\nmethodology, is handled by the S&P Global\nIndex Committee. Maintenance of component\ninvestments, including additions and deletions\nto these investments, is the responsibility of\nseparate regional index committees composed of\nS&P staff specialized in the various regional\nequity markets and, in some cases, with the\nassistance of local stock exchanges. Public\nannouncements of index changes as the result\nof committee decisions will generally be made\ntwo business days in advance of the\nanticipated effective date whenever possible,\nalthough for exceptional corporate events\nannouncements may be made earlier. Stocks are\nadded between rebalancing dates only if a\ndeletion in the index causes the stock count\nto fall below 22. In those cases, each stock\ndeletion is accompanied with a stock addition.\nThe new addition will be added to the index\nwith index shares that are commensurate with\nthe index shares of the stock in a\nhypothetical rebalancing using the closing\nprices on the date the addition is announced.\nThe index shares for all current constituents\nwill remain constant. In the case of spin-\noffs, the S&P Select Industry FMC Index will\nfollow the S&P TMI\u2019s treatment of the action.\nA stock is deleted from an S&P Select Industry\nFMC Index if the S&P TMI drops the stock. If a\nstock deletion causes the number of stocks in\nthe relevant index to fall below 22, each\nstock deletion is accompanied with a\ncorresponding stock addition. In the case of\nmergers involving two index constituents, the\nmerged entity will remain in the index\nprovided that it meets all general eligibility\nrequirements. In case of GICS changes, where a\nstock does not belong to a qualifying sub-\nindustry after the classification change, it\nis removed from the relevant index at the next\nrebalancing. Index Maintenance. Maintaining\nthe S&P DJI Indices includes monitoring and\ncompleting the adjustments for issuer\nadditions and deletions, share changes, stock\nsplits, stock dividends, and stock price\nadjustments due to restructuring and spin-\noffs. Index membership is reviewed quarterly\nand occurs after the closing on the third\nFriday of the quarter ending month. The\nreference date for additions and deletions is\nafter the closing of the last trading date of\nthe previous month. Closing prices as of the\nWednesday prior to the second Friday of the\nrebalancing month are used for setting capped\nindex weights. An issuer will be removed from\nthe S&P DJI Indices as a result of\nmergers/acquisitions, bankruptcy, or\nrestructuring. An issuer is removed from the\nrelevant index as close as possible to the\nactual date on which the event occurred. An\nissuer can be removed from an index because it\nno longer meets current criteria for inclusion\nand/or is no longer representative of its\nindustry group. All replacement issuers are\nselected based on the above component section\ncriteria. When calculating index weights,\nindividual component shares held by\ngovernments, corporations, strategic partners,\nor other control groups are excluded from the\nissuer\u2019s shares outstanding. Shares owned by\nother issuers are also excluded regardless of\nwhether they are index components. In\ncountries with regulated environments, where a\nforeign investment limit exists at the sector\nor issuer level, the constituent\u2019s weight will\nreflect either the foreign investment limit or\nthe percentage float, whichever is the more\nrestrictive.\n\n37\n\nEach issuer\u2019s financial statements will be\nused to update the major shareholders\u2019\nownership. However, during the course of the\nyear, SPDJI also monitors each issuer\u2019s\nInvestable Weight Factor ( \u201c IWF \u201d ) which is\nSPDJI\u2019s term for the mathematical float factor\nused to calculate the float adjustment. If a\nchange in IWF is caused by a major corporate\naction ( i.e. , privatization, merger,\ntakeover, or share offering) and the change\nequal to or greater than 5%, a float\nadjustment will be implemented as soon as\nreasonably possible. Changes in the number of\nshares outstanding driven by corporate events\nsuch as stock dividends, splits, and rights\nissues will be adjusted on the ex-date. Share\nchanges of 5% or greater are implemented when\nthey occur. Share changes of less than 5% are\nonly updated on a quarterly basis on the\nFriday near the end of the calendar quarter.\nGenerally, index changes due to rebalancing\nare announced two days before the effective\ndate by way of a news release posted on\nwww.us.spindices.com . Index Availability. The\nS&P Select Industry FMC Index is calculated\ncontinuously and is available from major data\nvendors. S&P Transportation Select Industry\nFMC Capped Index Number of Components:\napproximately 43 Index Description. The S&P\nTransportation Select Industry FMC Capped\nIndex is designed to measure the performance\nof U.S. companies within the transportation\nindustry. Securities in the Underlying Index\nare weighted based on the float-adjusted\nmarket value of their outstanding shares. The\nUnderlying Index uses a capping methodology to\nconstrain at quarterly rebalance: (i) the\nweight of any single issuer (as determined by\nSPDJI) to a maximum of 22.5%, and (ii) the\naggregate weight of all issuers that\nindividually exceed 4.5% of the index weight\nto a maximum of 45%. Closing prices as of the\nsecond Friday of the last month of the quarter\nare used for setting Underlying Index weights\nfor each quarterly rebalancing. The Underlying\nIndex is a float-adjusted market\ncapitalization weighted version of the S&P\nTransportation Select Industry Index. If any\nissuer\u2019s weight exceeds 22.5% at quarterly\nrebalance, that issuer\u2019s weight is capped and\nall excess weight is proportionally\nredistributed to all uncapped issuers within\nthe Underlying Index. If, after this\nredistribution, any other issuer breaches the\nissuer weight cap the process is repeated\niteratively until no issuer breaches the\nissuer capping rule. If the aggregate weight\nof issuers with weights greater than 4.5%\nexceeds 45% of the Underlying Index, all\nissues are ranked in descending order of their\nweights and the issuer with the smallest\nweight above 4.5% is identified and reduced\nuntil (1) the aggregate weight of issuers with\nweights greater than 4.5% equals 45% or less,\nor (2) 4.5%, whichever is greater. The excess\nweight is proportionally redistributed to all\nissuers with weights below 4.5% such that any\nissuer that receives such excess weight does\nnot breach the 4.5% cap. This process is\nrepeated iteratively until the aggregate\nweight of issuers with weights greater than\n4.5% equals 45% or less. The weight of one or\nmore securities in the Underlying Index may\nexceed these constraints due to fluctuations\nin market value, corporate actions or other\nevents that change the index composition\nbetween quarterly rebalance dates.

Investment Policies The Board has\nadopted as fundamental policies the following\nnumbered investment policies, which cannot be\nchanged without the approval of the holders of\na majority of the applicable Fund\u2019s\noutstanding voting securities. A vote of a\nmajority of the outstanding voting securities\nof a Fund is defined in the 1940 Act as the\nlesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities present at a shareholder meeting,\nif the holders of more than 50% of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (ii) more\nthan 50% of outstanding voting securities of\nthe Fund. Each Fund has also adopted certain\nnon-fundamental investment policies, including\nits investment objective. Non-fundamental\ninvestment policies may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval. Therefore,\neach Fund may change its investment objective\nand its Underlying Index without shareholder\napproval. Fundamental Investment Policies Each\nFund (other than the iShares Core Dividend\nETF, iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF, iShares\nCore High Dividend ETF, iShares Dow Jones U.S.\nETF, iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF and\niShares Select Dividend ETF) will not: 1.\nConcentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold 25%\nor more of its total assets in the stocks of a\nparticular industry or group of\n\n38\n\nindustries), except that each Fund will\nconcentrate to approximately the same extent\nthat its Underlying Index concentrates in the\nstocks of such particular industry or group of\nindustries. For purposes of this limitation,\nsecurities of the U.S. government (including\nits agencies and instrumentalities),\nrepurchase agreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities, and securities of state\nor municipal governments and their political\nsubdivisions are not considered to be issued\nby members of any industry. 2.

Concentrate its investments (\ni.e. , invest 25% or more of its total assets\nin the securities of a particular industry or\ngroup of industries), except that each Fund\nwill concentrate to approximately the same\nextent that its Underlying Index concentrates\nin the securities of such particular industry\nor group of industries. For purposes of this\nlimitation,\n\n39\n\nsecurities of the U.S. government (including\nits agencies and instrumentalities),\nrepurchase agreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities, and securities of state\nor municipal governments and their political\nsubdivisions are not considered to be issued\nby members of any industry. 2.

Make any investment\ninconsistent with the Fund's classification as\na diversified company under the 1940 Act.\nNotations Regarding each of the iShares Core\nDividend ETF's and iShares Core Dividend\nGrowth ETF's Fundamental Investment Policies\nThe following notations are not considered to\nbe part of the iShares Core Dividend ETF's and\niShares Core Dividend Growth ETF\u2019s fundamental\ninvestment policies and are subject to change\nwithout shareholder approval. With respect to\nthe fundamental policy relating to\nconcentration set forth in (1) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not define what\nconstitutes \u201c concentration \u201d in an industry.\nThe SEC staff has taken the position that\ninvestment of 25% or more of a fund\u2019s total\nassets in one or more issuers conducting their\nprincipal activities in the same industry or\ngroup of industries constitutes concentration.\nIt is possible that interpretations of\nconcentration could change in the future. The\npolicy in (1) above will be interpreted to\nrefer to concentration as that term may be\ninterpreted from time to time. The policy also\nwill be interpreted to permit investment\nwithout limit in the following: securities of\nthe U.S. government and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; securities of state,\nterritory, possession or municipal governments\nand their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\nthe iShares Core Dividend ETF's and iShares\nCore Dividend Growth ETF's industry\nclassifications, the Fund currently utilizes\nany one or more of the industry sub-\nclassifications used by one or more widely\nrecognized market indexes or rating group\nindexes, and/or as defined by Fund management.\nThe policy also will be interpreted to give\nbroad authority to the iShares Core Dividend\nETF and iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF as to\nhow to classify issuers within or among\nindustries. With respect to the fundamental\npolicy relating to borrowing money set forth\nin (2) above, the Investment Company Act\npermits the iShares Core Dividend ETF and\niShares Core Dividend Growth ETF to borrow\nmoney in amounts of up to one-third of the\nFund's total assets from banks for any\npurpose, and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund's\ntotal assets from banks or other lenders for\ntemporary purposes. (Each Fund's total assets\ninclude the amounts being borrowed.) To limit\nthe risks attendant to borrowing, the\nInvestment Company Act requires the iShares\nCore Dividend ETF and iShares Core Dividend\nGrowth ETF to maintain at all times an \u201c asset\ncoverage \u201d of at least 300% of the amount of\nits borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio\nthat the value of the iShares Core Dividend\nETF's and iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF's\ntotal assets (including amounts borrowed),\nminus liabilities other than borrowings, bears\nto the aggregate amount of all borrowings.\nBorrowing money to increase portfolio holdings\nis known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d Certain trading\npractices and investments, such as reverse\nrepurchase agreements, may be considered to be\nborrowings or involve leverage and thus are\nsubject to the Investment Company Act\nrestrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4\nunder the Investment Company Act, when the\niShares Core Dividend ETF and iShares Core\nDividend Growth ETF engage in reverse\nrepurchase agreements and similar financing\ntransactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain\nasset coverage of at least 300% with respect\nto such transactions and any other borrowings\nin the aggregate, or (ii) treat such\ntransactions as \u201c derivatives transactions \u201d\nand comply with Rule 18f-4 with respect to\nsuch transactions. Short-term credits\nnecessary for the settlement of securities\ntransactions and arrangements with respect to\nsecurities lending will not be considered to\nbe borrowings under the policy. Practices and\ninvestments that may involve leverage but are\nnot considered to be borrowings are not\nsubject to the policy. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to underwriting\nset forth in (5) above, the Investment Company\nAct does not prohibit the iShares Core\nDividend ETF and iShares Core Dividend Growth\nETF from engaging in the underwriting business\nor from underwriting the securities of other\nissuers; in fact, in the case of diversified\nfunds, the Investment Company Act permits a\nfund to have underwriting commitments of up to\n25% of its assets under certain circumstances.\nThose circumstances currently are that the\namount of the iShares Core Dividend ETF's and\niShares Core Dividend Growth ETF\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause the iShares Core\nDividend ETF and iShares Core Dividend Growth\nETF to be engaged in the business of\nunderwriting, the policy in (5) above will be\ninterpreted not to prevent a fund from\nengaging in transactions involving the\nacquisition or disposition of portfolio\nsecurities,\n\n41\n\nregardless of whether a fund may be considered\nto be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is\notherwise engaged in the underwriting business\nto the extent permitted by applicable law.\nWith respect to the fundamental policy\nrelating to lending set forth in (7) above,\nthe Investment Company Act does not prohibit\nthe iShares Core Dividend ETF and iShares Core\nDividend Growth ETF from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies iShares\nCore Dividend ETF and iShares Core Dividend\nGrowth ETF Each Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental policy not to make short sales of\nsecurities or maintain a short position,\nexcept to the extent permitted by the Fund's\nProspectus and SAI, as amended from time to\ntime, and applicable law. All Funds Other Than\nthe iShares Core Dividend ETF and iShares Core\nDividend Growth ETF Each Fund has adopted a\nnon-fundamental policy not to invest in the\nsecurities of a company for the purpose of\nexercising management or control, or purchase\nor otherwise acquire any illiquid investment,\nexcept as permitted under the 1940 Act, which\ncurrently limits each Fund's holdings in\nilliquid investments to 15% of a Fund's net\nassets. BFA monitors Fund holdings in illiquid\ninvestments, pursuant to the Liquidity\nProgram. If any percentage restriction\ndescribed above is complied with at the time\nof an investment, a later increase or decrease\nin percentage resulting from a change in\nvalues of assets will not constitute a\nviolation of such restriction, except that\ncertain percentage limitations will be\nobserved continuously in accordance with\napplicable law. All Funds Each Fund has\nadopted a non-fundamental investment policy in\naccordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act\nto invest, under normal circumstances, at\nleast 80% of the value of its net assets, plus\nthe amount of any borrowings for investment\npurposes, for all Funds other than iShares\nMorningstar Growth ETF, iShares Morningstar\nMid-Cap ETF, iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap\nGrowth ETF, iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Value\nETF, iShares Morningstar Small-Cap ETF,\niShares Morningstar Small-Cap Growth ETF,\niShares Morningstar Small-Cap Value ETF,\niShares Morningstar U.S. Equity ETF and\niShares Morningstar Value ETF (the \u201c iShares\nMorningstar ETFs \u201d ) and iShares Core Dividend\nGrowth ETF, in component securities of the\nUnderlying Index or in depositary receipts\nrepresenting component securities in the\nUnderlying Index and for each of the iShares\nMorningstar ETFs and iShares Core Dividend\nGrowth ETF, in component securities of its\nUnderlying Index. Each Fund also has adopted a\npolicy to provide its shareholders with at\nleast 60 days\u2019 prior written notice of any\nchange in such policy. If, subsequent to an\ninvestment, the 80% requirement is no longer\nmet, a Fund\u2019s future investments will be made\nin a manner that will bring the Fund into\ncompliance with this policy. Each Fund has\nadopted a non-fundamental policy not to\npurchase securities of other investment\ncompanies, except to the extent permitted by\nthe 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however,\na Fund will not purchase shares of any\nregistered open-end investment company or\nregistered unit investment trust, in reliance\non Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the \u201c fund of\nfunds \u201d provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any\ntime the Fund has knowledge that its shares\nare purchased by another investment company\ninvestor in reliance on the provisions of\nsubparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1). Unless\notherwise indicated, all limitations under the\nFund's fundamental or non-fundamental\ninvestment policies apply only at the time\nthat a transaction is undertaken. Any change\nin the percentage of the Fund's assets\ninvested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from market fluctuations\nor other changes in the Fund\u2019s total assets\nwill not require the Fund to dispose of an\ninvestment until BFA determines that it is\npracticable to sell or close out the\ninvestment without undue market or tax\nconsequences.\n\n42\n\nContinuous Offering The method by which\nCreation Units are created and traded may\nraise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery requirement and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client\nmay be deemed a statutory underwriter if it\ntakes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into\nconstituent shares and sells such shares\ndirectly to customers or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of new shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the 1933 Act must take into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-\ndealer or its client in the particular case\nand the examples mentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions\nin shares, whether or not participating in the\ndistribution of shares, generally are required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in\nrespect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus delivery obligation with\nrespect to shares of the Funds are reminded\nthat, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act,\na prospectus delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange\nmember in connection with a sale on the\nListing Exchange generally is satisfied by the\nfact that the prospectus is available at the\nListing Exchange upon request. The prospectus\ndelivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\nan exchange. Management Trustees and Officers.\nThe Board has responsibility for the overall\nmanagement and operations of the Funds,\nincluding general supervision of the duties\nperformed by BFA and other service providers.\nEach Trustee serves until he or she resigns,\nis removed, dies, retires or becomes\nincapacitated. Each officer shall hold office\nuntil his or her successor is elected and\nqualifies or until his or her death,\nresignation or removal. Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Trust are referred to as\nindependent trustees ( \u201c Independent Trustees\n\u201d ). The registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nBlackRock-advised Funds \u201d ) are organized into\nthe BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex, the\nBlackRock Fixed-Income Complex and the iShares\nComplex (each, a \u201c BlackRock Fund Complex \u201d ).\nEach Fund is included in the iShares Complex,\nwhich includes iShares Trust, iShares U.S. ETF\nTrust, and iShares, Inc. Each Trustee also\nserves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a\nTrustee of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a\nresult, oversees all of the funds within the\niShares Complex, which consists of 412 funds\nas of August 30, 2024. With the exception of\nStephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron\nWasserman, the address of each Trustee and\nofficer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address\nof Mr. Kapito and Mr. Wasserman is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001.

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Funds\nrests with the Board. The Board has engaged\nBFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis.\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing BFA\nand other service providers in the operations\nof the Funds in accordance with the provisions\nof the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of\nstate and other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter.\nThe Board is currently composed of eleven\nmembers, nine of whom are Independent\nTrustees. The Board currently conducts regular\nin person meetings four times a year. In\naddition, the Board frequently holds special\nin person or telephonic meetings or informal\nconference calls to discuss specific matters\nthat may arise or require action between\nregular meetings. The Independent Trustees\nmeet regularly outside the presence of\nmanagement, in executive session or with other\nservice providers to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Funds, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Funds with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the oversight functions delegated to\nthe Committee by the Board and reports its\nfinding to the Board. The Board and each\nstanding Committee conduct annual assessments\nof their oversight function and structure. The\nBoard has determined that the Board\u2019s\nleadership structure is appropriate because it\nallows the Board to exercise independent\njudgment over management and it allocates\nareas of responsibility among committees of\nIndependent Trustees and the full Board to\nenhance effective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Funds is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Funds. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of each\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Funds. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by each Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting each Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Funds'\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support each Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight\n\n51\n\nresponsibilities. From time to time, the Board\nmay modify the manner in which it conducts\nrisk oversight. The Board\u2019s oversight role\ndoes not make it a guarantor of the Funds'\ninvestment performance or other activities.\nCommittees of the Board of Trustees.

Certain activities of\nBFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively\nreferred to in this section as \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, with respect to the Funds and/or\nother accounts managed by BlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, including the business units or\nentities and personnel who may be involved in\nthe investment activities and business\noperations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in\nbusinesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Funds. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage a Fund and\nits shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by a Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Funds. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\na Fund's performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or client accounts, will be executed\nindependently of a Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFunds. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or\nsell the same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding a Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor a Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of a\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding a\nFund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for a Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause a Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so.\n\n69\n\nConflicts may also arise because portfolio\ndecisions regarding a Fund may benefit other\naccounts managed by BlackRock. For example,\nthe sale of a long position or establishment\nof a short position by a Fund may impair the\nprice of the same security sold short by (and\ntherefore benefit) BlackRock or its other\naccounts or funds, and the purchase of a\nsecurity or covering of a short position in a\nsecurity by a Fund may increase the price of\nthe same security held by (and therefore\nbenefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or\nfunds. In addition, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, certain Funds may invest their\nassets in other funds advised by BlackRock,\nincluding funds that are managed by one or\nmore of the same portfolio managers, which\ncould result in conflicts of interest relating\nto asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases\nand sales, and increased remuneration and\nprofitability for BlackRock, and/or its\npersonnel, including portfolio managers. In\ncertain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of\nthe Funds, may seek to buy from or sell\nsecurities to another fund or account advised\nby BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not\nrequired to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when a\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which a Fund has\ninvested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of a\nFund's investments may be negatively impacted\nby the activities of BlackRock or its clients,\nand transactions for the Fund may be impaired\nor effected at prices or terms that may be\nless favorable than would otherwise have been\nthe case. The results of a Fund\u2019s investment\nactivities may differ significantly from the\nresults achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by a Fund.\nMoreover, it is possible that a Fund will\nsustain losses during periods in which one or\nmore proprietary or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock achieve significant\nprofits. The opposite result is also possible.\nFrom time to time, a Fund may be restricted\nfrom purchasing or selling securities, or from\nengaging in other investment activities\nbecause of regulatory, legal or contractual\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock or other\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock,\nand/or the internal policies of BlackRock\ndesigned to comply with such requirements. As\na result, there may be periods, for example,\nwhen BlackRock will not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions in certain\nsecurities or instruments with respect to\nwhich BlackRock is performing services or when\nposition limits have been reached. For\nexample, the investment activities of\nBlackRock for its proprietary accounts and\naccounts under its management may limit the\ninvestment opportunities for a Fund in certain\nemerging and other markets in which\nlimitations are imposed upon the amount of\ninvestment, in the aggregate or in individual\nissuers, by affiliated foreign investors. In\nconnection with its management of a Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on behalf of a Fund in\naccordance with such analysis and models. In\naddition, BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to make available any information\nregarding its proprietary activities or\nstrategies, or the activities or strategies\nused for other accounts managed by them, for\nthe benefit of the management of a Fund and it\nis not anticipated that BlackRock will have\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the\nactivities or strategies used for accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock or other client accounts\ncould conflict with the transactions and\nstrategies employed by BlackRock in managing a\nFund. The Funds may be included in investment\nmodels developed by BlackRock for use by\nclients and financial advisors. To the extent\nclients invest in these investment models and\nincrease the assets under management of the\nFunds, the investment management fee amounts\npaid by the Funds to BlackRock may also\nincrease. The price, availability and\nliquidity of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by model-\ndriven investment portfolios, as well as by\nBlackRock itself and by its advisory clients.\nIn addition, certain principals and certain\nemployees of a Fund\u2019s investment adviser are\nalso principals or employees of other business\nunits or entities within BlackRock. As a\nresult, these principals and employees may\nhave obligations to such other\n\n70\n\nbusiness units or entities or their clients\nand such obligations to other business units\nor entities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund\nin which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by a Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which a Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non a Fund could potentially lead to increased\npurchase activity with respect to the Fund and\nincreased assets under management for\nBlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Funds or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may from\ntime to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. A Fund may, subject\nto applicable law, purchase investments that\nare the subject of an underwriting or other\ndistribution by BlackRock and may also enter\ninto transactions with other clients of\nBlackRock where such other clients have\ninterests adverse to those of the Fund. At\ntimes, these activities may cause business\nunits or entities within BlackRock to give\nadvice to clients that may cause these clients\nto take actions adverse to the interests of a\nFund. To the extent such transactions are\npermitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock on\nan arm\u2019s-length basis. To the extent\nauthorized by applicable law, BlackRock may\nact as broker, dealer, agent, lender or\nadviser or in other commercial capacities for\na Fund. It is anticipated that the\ncommissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial\nadvisory fees, underwriting and placement\nfees, sales fees, financing and commitment\nfees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation\nor profits, rates, terms and conditions\ncharged by BlackRock will be in its view\ncommercially reasonable, although BlackRock,\nincluding its sales personnel, will have an\ninterest in obtaining fees and other amounts\nthat are favorable to BlackRock and such sales\npersonnel, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Funds. Index based funds may use an index\nprovider that is affiliated with another\nservice provider of a Fund or BlackRock that\nacts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in\nother commercial capacities for a Fund or\nBlackRock. Subject to applicable law,\nBlackRock (and its personnel and other\ndistributors) will be entitled to retain fees\nand other amounts that they receive in\nconnection with their service to the Funds as\nbroker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in\nother commercial capacities. No accounting to\nthe Funds or their shareholders will be\nrequired, and no fees or other compensation\npayable by the Funds or their shareholders\nwill be reduced by reason of receipt by\nBlackRock of any such fees or other amounts.\nWhen BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities in\nrelation to the Funds, BlackRock may take\ncommercial steps in its own interests, which\nmay have an adverse effect on the Funds. A\nFund will be required to establish business\nrelationships with its counterparties based on\nthe Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will\nnot have any obligation to allow its credit to\nbe used in connection with a Fund's\nestablishment of its business relationships,\nnor is it expected that the Fund's\ncounterparties will rely on the credit of\nBlackRock in evaluating the Fund's\ncreditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of BFA\npursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFunds. BlackRock will also receive\ncompensation for managing the reinvestment of\nthe cash\n\n71\n\ncollateral from securities lending. There are\npotential conflicts of interests in managing a\nsecurities lending program, including but not\nlimited to: (i) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to, among\nother things, increase or decrease the amount\nof securities on loan or to lend particular\nsecurities in order to generate additional\nrisk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its\naffiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to\nallocate loans to clients that would provide\nmore revenue to BlackRock. As described\nfurther below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate\nthis conflict by providing its securities\nlending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Funds and certain other\nclients and/or funds against a shortfall in\ncollateral in the event of borrower default.\nOn a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the\npotential dollar exposure of collateral\nshortfall resulting from a borrower default (\n\u201c shortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e ., indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a loan opportunity arrives; and\n(iii) the lending portfolio must also have\nenough inventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. BlackRock may decline to\nmake a securities loan on behalf of a Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of a\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for a Fund may be\nbunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Funds will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Funds. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Funds will\nnot be charged the same commission or\ncommission equivalent rates in connection with\na bunched or aggregated order. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock may select brokers\nthat furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other\nBlackRock client accounts or personnel,\ndirectly or through correspondent\nrelationships, with research or other\nappropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Funds and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\n\n72\n\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the\nFunds based on the amount of brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Funds and such other\nBlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client's commissions may not be\nused in managing that client's account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate benefits, of economies of\nscale or price discounts in connection with\nproducts and services that may be provided to\nthe Funds and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself. BlackRock\ndoes not currently enter into arrangements to\nuse the Funds' assets for, or participate in,\nsoft dollars, although BlackRock may receive\nresearch that is bundled with the trade\nexecution, clearing, and/or settlement\nservices provided by a particular broker-\ndealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives\nresearch on this basis, many of the same\nconflicts related to traditional soft dollars\nmay exist. For example, the research\neffectively will be paid by client commissions\nthat also will be used to pay for the\nexecution, clearing, and settlement services\nprovided by the broker-dealer and will not be\npaid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless\nprohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to\nexecute trades through brokers who, pursuant\nto such arrangements, provide research or\nother services in order to ensure the\ncontinued receipt of research or other\nservices BlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to engage in\nthe above described arrangements to varying\ndegrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by\napplicable law, may also enter into commission\nsharing arrangements under which BlackRock may\nexecute transactions through a broker-dealer,\nand request that the broker-dealer allocate a\nportion of the commissions or commission\ncredits to another firm that provides research\nto BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock\nengages in commission sharing arrangements,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. BlackRock\nmay utilize certain electronic crossing\nnetworks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including, without\nlimitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an\ninvestment or other interest, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law) in executing\nclient securities transactions for certain\ntypes of securities. These ECNs may charge\nfees for their services, including access fees\nand transaction fees. The transaction fees,\nwhich are similar to commissions or\nmarkups/markdowns, will generally be charged\nto clients and, like commissions and\nmarkups/markdowns, would generally be included\nin the cost of the securities purchased.\nAccess fees may be paid by BlackRock even\nthough incurred in connection with executing\ntransactions on behalf of clients, including\nthe Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may\noffer volume discounts that will reduce the\naccess fees typically paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent\nwith its obligation to seek to obtain best\nexecution in client transactions. BlackRock\nowns a minority interest in, and is a member\nof, Members Exchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly\ncreated U.S. stock exchange. Transactions for\na Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party\nbrokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue\nfor execution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of such Funds. In addition,\ntransactions in Fund shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the\nappropriate venue for the execution of such\norders. BlackRock has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent conflicts of\ninterest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Funds, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock's fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee the Proxy Voting Policy section of this\nSAI. It is also possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of a\nFund. Increasing a Fund\u2019s assets may enhance\nliquidity, investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the\nright, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw, to sell into the market or redeem in\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of a Fund acquired for its own accounts\nor the account of a BlackRock advisory client.\nA large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund\nby BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory\nclient could significantly reduce the asset\nsize of the Fund, which might have an adverse\neffect on the Fund's liquidity, investment\nflexibility, portfolio diversification,\nexpense ratio or ability to comply with the\nlisting requirements for the Fund. It is\npossible that a Fund may invest in securities\nof, or engage in transactions with, companies\nin which BlackRock has significant debt or\nequity investments or other interests. A Fund\nmay also invest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by\n\n73\n\nentities for which BlackRock provides and is\ncompensated for cash management services\nrelating to the proceeds from the sale of such\nissuances. In making investment decisions for\na Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain\nor use material non-public information\nacquired by any unit of BlackRock in the\ncourse of these activities. In addition, from\ntime to time, the activities of BlackRock may\nlimit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and\nsales of securities. As indicated below,\nBlackRock may engage in transactions with\ncompanies in which BlackRock-advised funds or\nother clients of BlackRock have an investment.\nBlackRock, its personnel and other financial\nservice providers may have interests in\npromoting sales of the Funds. With respect to\nBlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration\nand profitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Funds or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFunds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFunds may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor\nevents (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to a Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients'\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\na Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other data sources unavailable to the\nFund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will\ngenerally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to a Fund's\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund's pricing\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan the valuation for such security or\ninvestment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock. As disclosed in more detail in the\nDetermination of Net Asset Value section in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, each Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value by BFA. BFA has been designated\nas each Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBFA pricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BFA using proprietary or third-party\nvaluation models, fair value represents only a\ngood faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of one or\nmore assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, a Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, a Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in a Fund bearing\nsome additional expenses. BlackRock and its\ndirectors, officers and employees, may buy and\nsell securities or other investments for their\nown accounts and may have conflicts of\ninterest with respect to investments made on\nbehalf of a Fund. As a result of differing\ntrading and investment strategies or\nconstraints, positions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees that are the\nsame, different from or made at different\ntimes than positions taken for a Fund. To\nlessen the possibility that a Fund will be\nadversely\n\n74\n\naffected by this personal trading, each Fund,\nBFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of\nethics in compliance with Section 17(j) of the\n1940 Act that restricts securities trading in\nthe personal accounts of investment\nprofessionals and others who normally come\ninto possession of information regarding a\nFund's portfolio transactions. Each code of\nethics is available by contacting BlackRock at\nthe telephone number on the back cover of each\nFund\u2019s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR\nDatabase on the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\na Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance\nwith rules or guidance adopted under the 1940\nAct engage in transactions with another Fund\nor accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as\na result of common officers, directors, or\ninvestment advisers or pursuant to exemptive\norders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock\nby the SEC. These transactions would be\neffected in circumstances in which BlackRock\ndetermined that it would be appropriate for a\nFund to purchase and another client of\nBlackRock to sell, or the Fund to sell and\nanother client of BlackRock to purchase, the\nsame security or instrument on the same day.\nFrom time to time, the activities of a Fund\nmay be restricted because of regulatory\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock and/or\nBlackRock's internal policies designed to\ncomply with, limit the applicability of, or\notherwise relate to such requirements. A\nclient not advised by BlackRock would not be\nsubject to some of those considerations. There\nmay be periods when BlackRock may not initiate\nor recommend certain types of transactions, or\nmay otherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of a Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which a Fund wishes to purchase\nor sell. However, if permitted by applicable\nlaw, and where consistent with BlackRock\u2019s\npolicies and procedures (including the\nnecessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Funds may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Funds. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Funds invest in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or are\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invest in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Funds) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Funds or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Funds), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the\nFunds), may limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Funds),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations.\n\n75\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, other ownership\nthresholds may trigger reporting requirements\nto governmental and regulatory authorities,\nand such reports may entail the disclosure of\nthe identity of a client or BlackRock\u2019s\nintended strategy with respect to such\nsecurity or asset. BlackRock may not serve as\nan Authorized Participant in the creation and\nredemption of iShares ETFs. Under an ETF\nServices Agreement, certain Funds have\nretained BRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to perform\ncertain order processing, Authorized\nParticipant communications, and related\nservices in connection with the issuance and\nredemption of Creation Units of the Funds ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will retain a portion\nof the standard transaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each creation or\nredemption order from the Authorized\nParticipant for the ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d )\non the design and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may have, or from\ntime to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its affiliates. In order to defray\ntransaction expenses and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, the Funds may\ncollect certain fees from Authorized\nParticipants in connection with creation and\nredemption transactions. While BlackRock uses\ngood faith estimates of the expected costs to\nthe Funds in determining the rates for fees\ncollected by the Funds related to creation and\nredemption activity, BlackRock may have\nincentives to improve Fund performance through\nthe collection of these fees. As these charges\nare based on estimates, where the charges\nexceed actual transaction- related costs\nand/or expenses incurred by a Fund, Fund\nperformance could improve as a result.\nBlackRock has established processes to oversee\nthe determination of these estimates in an\neffort to mitigate this conflict. BlackRock\nmay maintain securities indices. To the extent\npermitted by applicable laws, the Funds may\nseek to license and use such indices as part\nof their investment strategy. Index based\nfunds that seek to track the performance of\nsecurities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Funds using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to a Fund\nand the Funds are under no obligation to use\nBlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a\nlicense for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to a Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to a\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Funds,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to a Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to a Fund, or the selection\nof such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by a Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Funds, that engage\nthe service provider (typically the\ncustodian). A Fund\u2019s service provider\nremunerates BlackRock for the use of the\nsystems. A Fund service provider\u2019s payments to\nBlackRock for the use of these systems may\nenhance the profitability of BlackRock.\n\n76\n\nBlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a service\nprovider in connection with the use of systems\nprovided by BlackRock may create an incentive\nfor BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider. In recognition of a BlackRock\nclient\u2019s overall relationship with BlackRock,\nBlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in a Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock (including BFA), its\ndirectors, officers and employees, in addition\nto those described in this section, may give\nrise to additional conflicts of interest.\nInvestment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services Investment Adviser. BFA\nserves as investment adviser to each Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and\nBFA. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is\nregistered as an investment adviser under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nUnder the investment advisory agreement, BFA,\nsubject to the supervision of the Board and in\nconformity with the stated investment policies\nof each Fund, manages and administers the\nTrust and the investment of each Fund\u2019s\nassets. BFA is responsible for placing\npurchase and sale orders and providing\ncontinuous supervision of the investment\nportfolio of each Fund. Pursuant to the\ninvestment advisory agreement, BFA may, from\ntime to time, in its sole discretion and to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to a Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. BFA is\nresponsible, under the investment advisory\nagreement, for substantially all expenses of\nthe Funds, including the cost of transfer\nagency, custody, fund administration, legal,\naudit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Funds will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees). The following describes the\ncalculation of the management fee for each\nFund whose management fee is subject to\nbreakpoints. The management fee for all Funds\nis set forth in the table that follows the\ndescription of breakpoints. For its investment\nadvisory services to the iShares U.S. Basic\nMaterials ETF, iShares U.S. Consumer\nDiscretionary ETF, iShares U.S. Consumer\nStaples ETF, iShares U.S. Energy ETF, iShares\nU.S. Financial Services ETF, iShares U.S.\nFinancials ETF, iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF,\niShares U.S. Industrials ETF, iShares U.S.\nTechnology ETF, iShares U.S. Transportation\nETF and iShares U.S. Utilities ETF, BFA is\npaid a management fee from such Funds\ncorresponding to each Fund\u2019s allocable portion\nof an aggregate management fee calculated\nbased on the aggregate average daily net\nassets of the following iShares Funds: iShares\nU.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF, iShares U.S.\nBasic Materials ETF, iShares U.S. Broker-\nDealers & Securities Exchanges ETF, iShares\nU.S. Consumer Discretionary ETF, iShares U.S.\nConsumer Staples ETF, iShares U.S. Energy ETF,\niShares U.S. Financial Services ETF, iShares\nU.S. Financials ETF, iShares U.S. Healthcare\nETF, iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF,\niShares U.S. Home Construction ETF, iShares\nU.S. Industrials ETF, iShares U.S. Insurance\nETF, iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF, iShares\nU.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF,\niShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services ETF,\niShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF, iShares U.S.\nReal Estate ETF, iShares U.S. Regional Banks\nETF, iShares U.S. Technology ETF, iShares U.S.\nTelecommunications ETF, iShares U.S.\nTransportation ETF and iShares U.S. Utilities\nETF. The aggregate management fee is\ncalculated as follows: 0.4800% per annum of\nthe aggregate net assets less than or equal to\n$10.0 billion, plus 0.4300% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $10.0 billion, up to\nand including $20.0 billion, plus 0.3800% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets over $20.0\nbillion, up to and including $30.0 billion,\nplus 0.3400% per annum of the aggregate net\nassets over $30.0 billion, up to and including\n$40.0 billion, plus 0.3300% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $40.0 billion, up to\nand including $50.0 billion, plus 0.3100% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets over $50.0\nbillion, up to and including $60.0 billion,\nplus 0.2945% per annum of the aggregate net\nassets in excess of $60.0 billion.\n\n77\n\nFor its investment advisory services to the\niShares Select Dividend ETF, BFA is paid a\nmanagement fee from the iShares Select\nDividend ETF calculated based on the aggregate\naverage daily net assets of the following\niShares funds: iShares Latin America 40 ETF,\niShares MSCI Pacific ex Japan ETF, iShares\nPreferred and Income Securities ETF, iShares\nRussell 2000 ETF, iShares Russell 2000 Growth\nETF, iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF and\niShares Select Dividend ETF. The management\nfee for the iShares Select Dividend ETF equals\nthe ratio of the Fund's net assets over the\naggregate net assets of the above iShares\nfunds multiplied by the amount calculated as\nfollows: 0.4000% per annum of the aggregate\nnet assets less than or equal to $46 billion,\nplus 0.3800% per annum of the aggregate net\nassets over $46 billion, up to and including\n$81 billion, plus 0.3610% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $81 billion, up to\nand including $111 billion, plus 0.3430% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets over $111\nbillion, up to and including $141 billion,\nplus 0.3259% per annum of the aggregate net\nassets over $141 billion, up to and including\n$171 billion, plus 0.3096% per annum of the\naggregate net assets in excess of $171\nbillion. For its investment advisory services\nto the iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF, BFA is\npaid a management fee from the Fund calculated\nbased on the aggregate average daily net\nassets of the following iShares funds: iShares\n1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF,\niShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate\nBond ETF, iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade\nCorporate Bond ETF, iShares Biotechnology ETF,\niShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF, iShares iBoxx\n$ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares\nMBS ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF,\niShares Russell 1000 Value ETF, iShares\nRussell Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap\nGrowth ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF,\niShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF and iShares\nTIPS Bond ETF. The management fee for the\niShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF equals the\nratio of the Fund\u2019s net assets over the\naggregate net assets of the above iShares\nfunds multiplied by the amount calculated as\nfollows: 0.3500% per annum of the aggregate\nnet assets less than or equal to $121 billion,\nplus 0.3325% per annum of the aggregate net\nassets over $121 billion, up to and including\n$181 billion, plus 0.3159% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $181 billion, up to\nand including $231 billion, plus 0.3001% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets over $231\nbillion, up to and including $281 billion,\nplus 0.2851% per annum of the aggregate net\nassets in excess of $281 billion.

As a consequence, from time to\ntime each Fund may receive a smaller\nallocation of an investment opportunity than\nit would have if the Portfolio Managers and\nBFA and its affiliates did not manage other\nportfolios or accounts. Like the Funds, the\nother portfolios or accounts for which the\nPortfolio Managers are primarily responsible\nfor the day-to-day portfolio management\ngenerally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its\naffiliates, as applicable, for its advisory\nservices. One or more of those other\nportfolios or accounts, however, may pay BFA\nor its affiliates a performance-based fee in\nlieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee\nfor its advisory services. A portfolio or\naccount with a performance-based fee would pay\nBFA or its affiliates a portion of that\nportfolio\u2019s or account\u2019s gains, or would pay\nBFA or its affiliates more for its services\nthan would otherwise be the case if BFA or any\nof its affiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Funds should be aware\nthat, as with any group of portfolios and\naccounts managed by an investment adviser\nand/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below show, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of April 30, 2024:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n80\n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts        Performance   Total Assets  \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1  $2,853,000,0\u2026  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of April 30, 2024.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance.

As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each\nFund is responsible for fees in connection\nwith the investment of cash collateral\nreceived for securities on loan in a money\nmarket fund managed by BFA (the \u201c collateral\ninvestment fees \u201d ); however, BTC has agreed\nto reduce the amount of securities lending\nincome it receives in order to effectively\nlimit the collateral investment fees the Fund\nbears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money\nmarket fund shares will not be subject to a\nsales load, redemption fee, distribution fee\nor service fee. Under the securities lending\nprogram, the Funds are categorized into one of\nseveral specific asset classes. The\ndetermination of a Fund\u2019s asset class category\n(fixed-income, domestic equity, international\nequity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be\nsubject to a different fee arrangement, is\nbased on a methodology agreed to by the Trust\nand BTC.

In addition, commencing the\nbusiness day following the date that the\naggregate securities lending income (which\nincludes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the iShares\nComplex (as defined in the Management \u2014\nTrustees and Officers section of this SAI) in\na calendar year exceeds a specified threshold,\neach applicable Fund, pursuant to the current\nSecurities Lending Agency Agreement, will\nreceive for the remainder of that calendar\nyear securities lending income as follows: (i)\n81% of securities lending income (which\nexcludes collateral investment fees); and (ii)\nthis amount can never be less than 70% of the\nsum of the securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees. The services\nprovided to the Funds by BTC in the most\nrecent fiscal year ended April 30, 2024\nprimarily included the following: (1)\nselecting borrowers from an approved list of\nborrowers and executing a securities lending\nagreement as agent on behalf of the Funds with\neach such borrower; (2) negotiating the terms\nof securities loans, including the amount of\nfees; (3) directing the delivery of loaned\nsecurities; (4) monitoring the daily value of\nthe loaned securities and directing the\npayment of additional collateral or the return\nof excess collateral, as necessary; (5)\ninvesting cash collateral received in\nconnection with any loaned securities; (6)\nmonitoring distributions on loaned securities\n(for example, interest and dividend activity);\n(7) in the event of default by a borrower with\nrespect to any securities loan, using the\ncollateral or the proceeds of the liquidation\nof collateral to purchase replacement\nsecurities of the same issue, type, class and\nseries as that of the loaned securities; and\n(8) terminating securities loans and arranging\nfor the return of loaned securities to the\nFunds at loan termination.

BFA and/or\nits affiliates ( \u201c BFA Entities \u201d ) may pay\ncertain broker-dealers, registered investment\nadvisers, banks and other financial\nintermediaries ( \u201c Intermediaries \u201d ) for\ncertain activities related to the Funds, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products in\ngeneral. BFA Entities make these payments from\ntheir own assets and\n\n94\n\nnot from the assets of the Funds. Although a\nportion of BFA Entities\u2019 revenue comes\ndirectly or indirectly in part from fees paid\nby the Funds, other iShares funds (including,\nif applicable, any underlying iShares funds\nheld by a Fund) or exchange-traded products,\nthese payments do not increase the price paid\nby investors for the purchase of shares of, or\nthe cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares\nfunds or exchange-traded products. BFA\nEntities make payments for Intermediaries\u2019\nparticipation in activities that are designed\nto make registered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Funds and other iShares funds,\nor for other activities, such as participation\nin marketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Funds,\nother iShares funds or exchange-traded\nproducts ( \u201c Publishing Costs \u201d ). In\naddition, BFA Entities make payments to\nIntermediaries that make shares of the Funds,\nother iShares funds or exchange-traded\nproducts available to their clients, in some\ncases at a waived or reduced commission rate\nor ticket charge, develop new products that\nfeature iShares, create educational content\nabout the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products that is featured on\nan Intermediary\u2019s platform, or otherwise\npromote the Funds, other iShares funds and\nexchange-traded products. BFA Entities may\nalso reimburse expenses or make payments from\ntheir own assets to Intermediaries or other\npersons in consideration of services or other\nactivities that the BFA Entities believe may\nbenefit the iShares business or facilitate\ninvestment in the Funds, other iShares funds\nor exchange-traded products. Payments of the\ntype described above are sometimes referred to\nas revenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Funds, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products, or otherwise promote\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm. In addition to\nthe payments described above, BFA Entities\nhave developed proprietary tools, calculators\nand related interactive or digital content\nthat is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Funds, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, American Enterprise\nInvestment Services Inc., Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Cetera Financial\n\n95\n\nGroup, Inc., Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.,\nClearstream Fund Centre AG, Commonwealth\nEquity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and\nAssociates, LLC, Dynasty Financial Partners\nLLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset\nManagement, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc.,\nLPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\nFenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley\nSmith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual\nInvestment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio\nSolutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public Holdings,\nInc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.,\nRiskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC,\nStash Investments LLC, TD Ameritrade, Inc.,\nUBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo\nAdvisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFunds, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Funds, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Funds may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Funds would pay a\nfee to the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity\nand quality of the secondary market of\nsecurities of a Fund. The fee would then be\ncredited by the exchange to one or more market\nmakers that meet or exceed liquidity and\nmarket quality standards with respect to the\nsecurities of a Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of a\nFund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will\nnot be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds\nmanaged by BFA may also participate in such\nprograms. Determination of Net Asset Value\nValuation of Shares. The NAV for each Fund is\ngenerally calculated as of the close of\nregular trading hours on the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is\nopen. Valuation of assets held by a Fund is as\nfollows: Equity Investments. Equity securities\ntraded on a recognized securities exchange (\ne.g. , NYSE), on separate trading boards of a\nsecurities exchange or through a market system\nthat provides contemporaneous transaction\npricing information (each an \u201c Exchange \u201d )\nare valued using information obtained via\nindependent pricing services, generally at the\nclosing price or, if an Exchange closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on\nthat Exchange prior to the time as of which\nthe assets or liabilities are valued. However,\nunder certain circumstances, other means of\ndetermining current market value may be used.\nIf an equity security is traded on more than\none Exchange, the current market value of the\nsecurity where it is primarily traded\ngenerally will be used. In the event that\nthere are no sales involving an equity\nsecurity held by a Fund on a day on which a\nFund values such security, the prior day\u2019s\nprice will be used, unless BFA determines that\nsuch prior day\u2019s price no longer reflects the\nfair value of the security, in which case such\nasset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset\n(as defined below). Options, Futures, Swaps\nand Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded equity\noptions (except those that are customized) for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values\nsuch option, the last bid (long positions) or\nask (short positions) price, if available,\nwill be used as the value of such option. If\nno bid or ask price is available on a day on\nwhich a Fund values such option, the prior\nday\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother\n\n96\n\nderivatives are generally valued daily based\nupon quotations from market makers or by a\npricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value a Fund\u2019s securities and other\nassets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time a Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich a Fund valued such security, the revised\npricing service quotation generally will be\napplied prospectively. Such determination will\nbe made considering pertinent facts and\ncircumstances surrounding the revision. The\nprice a Fund could receive upon the sale of\nany particular portfolio investment may differ\nfrom a Fund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for assets that trade in thin or\nvolatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation methodology or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. As a\nresult, the price received upon the sale of an\ninvestment may be less than the value ascribed\nby a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund\u2019s\nability to value its investment may also be\nimpacted by technological issues and/or errors\nby pricing services or other third-party\nservice providers. All cash, receivables and\ncurrent payables are carried on a Fund\u2019s books\nat their fair value. In the event that\napplication of the methods of valuation\ndiscussed above result in a price for a\nsecurity which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, each Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by a Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. Use of\nfair value prices and certain current market\nvaluations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and the prices used in the Underlying\nIndex, which, in turn, could result in a\ndifference between a Fund\u2019s performance and\nthe performance of the Underlying Index. Fair\nValue. When market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, a Fund\u2019s investments are valued at\nfair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing a Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, a Fund. On\nany day the NYSE is open and a foreign market\nor the primary exchange on which a foreign\nasset or liability is traded is closed, such\nasset or liability will be valued using the\nprior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA is not\naware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. For certain foreign assets, a third-\nparty vendor supplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the movement of\na proprietary multi-factor model after the\nrelevant foreign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing methodology is\ndesigned to correlate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S. markets\nfollowing the close of the local markets to\nthe prices that might have prevailed as of a\nFund\u2019s pricing time. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee\nis responsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a\nFund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand\n\n97\n\nregularly evaluating the values assigned to\nthe securities and other assets and\nliabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair\nValue Assets is subsequently reported to the\nBoard or a committee thereof. When determining\nthe price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will\nseek to determine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on which\nthe asset or liability is being valued, and\ndoes not seek to determine the price a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair\nvalue determinations will be based upon all\navailable factors that BFA deems relevant at\nthe time of the determination, and may be\nbased on analytical values determined by BFA\nusing proprietary or third-party valuation\nmodels. Fair value represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. When determining the fair value of\nan investment, one or more fair value\nmethodologies may be used (depending on\ncertain factors, including the asset type).\nFor example, the investment may be initially\npriced based on the original cost of the\ninvestment or, alternatively, using\nproprietary or third-party models that may\nrely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nEach Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect a\nFund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to a Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Funds,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, a Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including a\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause a Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for a Fund and may take into account\na variety of factors including: (i) the size,\nnature and character of the security or\ninstrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of\n\n98\n\ntheir ability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time, a\nFund may purchase new issues of securities in\na fixed price offering. In these situations,\nthe broker may be a member of the selling\ngroup that will, in addition to selling\nsecurities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). The\nFunds anticipate that brokerage transactions\ninvolving foreign equity securities generally\nwill be conducted primarily on the principal\nstock exchanges of the applicable country.\nForeign equity securities may be held by the\nFunds in the form of depositary receipts, or\nother securities convertible into foreign\nequity securities. Depositary receipts may be\nlisted on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC\nmarkets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may\nbe. ADRs, like other securities traded in the\nU.S., will be subject to negotiated commission\nrates. OTC issues, including most fixed-income\nsecurities such as corporate debt and U.S.\nGovernment securities, are normally traded on\na \u201c net \u201d basis without a stated commission,\nthrough dealers acting for their own account\nand not as brokers. The Funds will primarily\nengage in transactions with these dealers or\ndeal directly with the issuer unless a better\nprice or execution could be obtained by using\na broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit. Under the 1940\nAct, persons affiliated with a Fund and\npersons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the dealers\nacting as principal for their own accounts,\nthe Funds will not deal with affiliated\npersons and affiliated persons of such\naffiliated persons in connection with such\ntransactions. The Funds will not purchase\nsecurities during the existence of any\nunderwriting or selling group relating to such\nsecurities of which BFA, BRIL or any\naffiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nthereof is a member except pursuant to\nprocedures adopted by the Board in accordance\nwith Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act. Purchases\nof money market instruments by the Funds are\nmade from dealers, underwriters and issuers.\nThe Funds do not currently expect to incur any\nbrokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Funds with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Funds\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an\n\n99\n\naccount; (ix) relative size of account; and\n(x) such other factors as may be approved by\nBlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. IPOs of\nsecurities may be over-subscribed and\nsubsequently trade at a premium in the\nsecondary market. When BFA is given an\nopportunity to invest in such an initial\noffering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue, the\nsupply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in a Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well. Because different\naccounts may have differing investment\nobjectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell\nthe same securities at the same time for\ndifferent clients based on the particular\ninvestment objective, guidelines and\nstrategies of those accounts. For example, BFA\nmay decide that it may be entirely appropriate\nfor a growth fund to sell a security at the\nsame time a value fund is buying that\nsecurity. To the extent that transactions on\nbehalf of more than one client of BFA or the\nother Affiliates during the same period\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, there may be an adverse effect on price.\nFor example, sales of a security by BlackRock\non behalf of one or more of its clients may\ndecrease the market price of such security,\nadversely impacting other BlackRock clients\nthat still hold the security. If purchases or\nsales of securities arise for consideration at\nor about the same time that would involve the\nFunds or other clients or funds for which BFA\nor another Affiliate act as investment\nmanager, transactions in such securities will\nbe made, insofar as feasible, for the\nrespective funds and clients in a manner\ndeemed equitable to all. In certain instances,\nBFA may find it efficient for purposes of\nseeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate\nor \u201c bunch \u201d certain contemporaneous purchases\nor sale orders of its advisory accounts and\nadvisory accounts of affiliates. In general,\nall contemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Funds are\nconcerned, in other cases it could be\nbeneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected\nby BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of\nmore than one of its clients during the same\nperiod may increase the demand for securities\nbeing purchased or the supply of securities\nbeing sold, causing an adverse effect on\nprice. The trader will give the bunched order\nto the broker-dealer that the trader has\nidentified as being able to provide the best\nexecution of the order. Orders for purchase or\nsale of securities will be placed within a\nreasonable amount of time of the order receipt\nand bunched orders will be kept bunched only\nlong enough to execute the order. The table\nbelow sets forth the brokerage commissions\npaid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted.\nAny differences in brokerage commissions paid\nby a Fund from year to year are principally\ndue to increases or decreases in that Fund\u2019s\nassets over those periods or the magnitude of\nchanges to the components of a Fund's\nUnderlying Index:\n\n100\n

If purchases or\nsales of portfolio securities of the Funds and\none or more other accounts managed or advised\nby BlackRock are considered at or about the\nsame time, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Funds and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Funds\nare concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFunds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest\nfor its own account in the types of securities\nin which the\n\n102\n\nFunds may invest. BlackRock may, from time to\ntime, effect trades on behalf of and for the\naccount of the Funds with brokers or dealers\nthat are affiliated with BFA, in conformity\nwith the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Funds\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses.

     \nAdditional Information Concerning the Trust\nShares. The Trust issues shares of beneficial\ninterests in the funds with no par value. The\nBoard may designate additional iShares funds.\nEach share issued by a fund has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of that fund. Shares\nhave no preemptive, exchange, subscription or\nconversion rights and are freely transferable.\nEach share is entitled to participate equally\nin dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to the relevant fund, and\nin the net distributable assets of such fund\non liquidation.\n\n103\n\nEach share has one vote with respect to\nmatters upon which the shareholder is entitled\nto vote. In any matter submitted to\nshareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold\na separate vote, provided that shareholders of\nall affected funds will vote together when:\n(i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the\nTrustees determine that the matter affects the\ninterests of more than one fund. Under\nDelaware law, the Trust is not required to\nhold an annual meeting of shareholders unless\nrequired to do so under the 1940 Act. The\npolicy of the Trust is not to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do\nso under the 1940 Act. All shares (regardless\nof the fund) have noncumulative voting rights\nin the election of members of the Board. Under\nDelaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be\nremoved by vote of the shareholders. Following\nthe creation of the initial Creation Unit(s)\nof shares of a fund and immediately prior to\nthe commencement of trading in such fund\u2019s\nshares, a holder of shares may be a \u201c control\nperson \u201d of the fund, as defined in Rule 0-1\nunder the 1940 Act. A fund cannot predict the\nlength of time for which one or more\nshareholders may remain a control person of\nthe fund. Shareholders may make inquiries by\nwriting to iShares Trust, c/o BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive,\nPrinceton, NJ 08540. Absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of\nthe shares of a fund may be subject to the\nreporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934\nAct and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould consult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff. In accordance with\nthe Trust's current Agreement and Declaration\nof Trust (the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the\nBoard may, without shareholder approval\n(unless such shareholder approval is required\nby the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Funds. Shares of\neach Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain 104\n\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of each\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of each Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with each Fund's\nlaunch, each Fund was seeded through the sale\nof one or more Creation Units by each Fund to\none or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof each Fund or each Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor each Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nEach Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\neach Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund\u2019s NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the applicable Listing\n\n105\n\nExchange closes earlier than normal, the Funds\nmay require orders to be placed earlier in the\nday.

          \nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of a\nFund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation Unit.\nThe Board reserves the right to declare a\nsplit or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of any Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board. A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\neach Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. Each Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\neach Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of a Fund generally\nconsists of Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent computed as described below.\nTogether, the Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent constitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d\nwhich, when combined with the Fund's portfolio\nsecurities, is designed to generate\nperformance that has a collective investment\nprofile similar to that of the Underlying\nIndex. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum\ninitial and subsequent investment amount for a\nCreation Unit of any Fund. Such Fund Deposit\nis applicable, subject to any adjustments as\ndescribed below, to purchases of Creation\nUnits of shares of a given Fund until such\ntime as the next-announced Fund Deposit is\nmade available.\n\n106\n\nThe \u201c Cash Component \u201d is an amount equal to\nthe difference between the NAV of the shares\n(per Creation Unit) and the \u201c Deposit Amount,\n\u201d which is an amount equal to the market value\nof the Deposit Securities, and serves to\ncompensate for any differences between the NAV\nper Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount.\nPayment of any stamp duty or other similar\nfees and expenses payable upon transfer of\nbeneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities\nare the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant purchasing a Creation Unit. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit\nSecurities change pursuant to changes in the\ncomposition of a Fund's portfolio and as\nrebalancing adjustments and corporate action\nevents are reflected from time to time by BFA\nwith a view to the investment objective of the\nFund. The composition of the Deposit\nSecurities may also change in response to\nadjustments to the weighting or composition of\nthe component securities constituting the\nrelevant Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit\nmay also be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nDeposit Securities portion of the Fund Deposit\nthrough \u201c systematic rounding. \u201d The rounding\nmethodology \u201c rounds up \u201d position sizes of\nsecurities in the Deposit Securities (which in\nturn reduces the cash portion). However, the\nmethodology limits the maximum allowed\npercentage change in weight and share quantity\nof any given security in the Fund Deposit.\nFund Deposits may also be modified to position\na fund towards a forward index rebalance to\nreflect revisions that account for index\nadditions, deletions, and re-weights. The\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the\nCash Component to replace any Deposit Security\nin certain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit partial or full cash purchases of\nCreation Units of its funds, when partial or\nfull cash purchases of Creation Units are\navailable or specified for a Fund, they will\nbe effected in essentially the same manner as\nin-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a\npartial or full cash purchase, the Authorized\nParticipant must pay the cash equivalent of\nthe Deposit Securities it would otherwise be\nrequired to provide through an in-kind\npurchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Funds, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith the Funds or one of their service\nproviders that allows such member or\nparticipant to place orders for the purchase\nand redemption of Creation Units is referred\nto as an \u201c Authorized Participant. \u201d All\nshares of the Funds, however created, will be\nentered on the records of DTC in the name of\nCede & Co. for the account of a DTC\nParticipant. Role of the Authorized\nParticipant. Creation Units may be purchased\nonly by or through a member or participant of\na clearing agency registered with the SEC,\nwhich has a written agreement with the Funds\nor one of their service providers that allows\nsuch member or participant to place orders for\nthe purchase and redemption of Creation Units\n(an \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ). Such\nAuthorized Participant will agree, pursuant to\nthe terms of such Authorized Participant\nAgreement and on behalf of itself or any\ninvestor on whose behalf it will act, to\ncertain conditions, including that such\nAuthorized Participant will make available in\nadvance of each purchase of shares an amount\nof cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component,\nonce the NAV of a Creation Unit is next\ndetermined after receipt of the purchase order\nin proper form, together with the transaction\nfees described below. An Authorized\nParticipant, acting on behalf of an investor,\nmay require the investor to enter into an\nagreement with such Authorized Participant\nwith respect to certain matters, including\npayment of the Cash Component. Investors who\nare not Authorized Participants must make\nappropriate arrangements with an Authorized\nParticipant. Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not be a DTC\nParticipant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\nAuthorized Participant. As a result, purchase\norders placed through an Authorized\nParticipant may result in additional charges\nto such investor. The Trust does not expect to\nenter into an Authorized Participant Agreement\nwith more than a\n\n107\n\nsmall number of DTC Participants. A list of\ncurrent Authorized Participants may be\nobtained from the Distributor. The Distributor\nhas adopted guidelines regarding Authorized\nParticipants\u2019 transactions in Creation Units\nthat are made available to all Authorized\nParticipants. These guidelines set forth the\nprocesses and standards for Authorized\nParticipants to transact with the Distributor\nand its agents in connection with creation and\nredemption transactions. In addition, the\nDistributor may be appointed as the proxy of\nthe Authorized Participant and may be granted\na power of attorney under its Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Purchase Orders. To\ninitiate an order for a Creation Unit, an\nAuthorized Participant must submit to the\nDistributor or its agent an irrevocable order\nto purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form,\ngenerally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on\nany Business Day to receive that day\u2019s NAV.\nThe Distributor or its agent will notify BFA\nand the custodian of such order. The custodian\nwill then provide such information to any\nappropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and\nrequirements governing the delivery of the\nFund Deposit are set forth in the procedures\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Investors, other\nthan Authorized Participants, are responsible\nfor making arrangements for a creation request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFunds, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\napplicable deadline for cash transfers by\ncontacting the operations department of the\nbroker or depositary institution effectuating\nthe transfer of the Cash Component. This\ndeadline is likely to be significantly earlier\nthan the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors\nshould be aware that an Authorized Participant\nmay require orders for purchases of shares\nplaced with it to be in the particular form\nrequired by the individual Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant is\nresponsible for any and all expenses and costs\nincurred by a Fund, including any applicable\ncash amounts, in connection with any purchase\norder. Timing of Submission of Purchase\nOrders. An Authorized Participant must submit\nan irrevocable order to purchase shares of a\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Funds to the Distributor or\nits agent pursuant to procedures set forth in\nthe Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic\nor market disruptions or changes, or telephone\nor other communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. Orders to create\nshares of a Fund that are submitted on the\nBusiness Day immediately preceding a holiday\nor a day (other than a weekend) when the\nequity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market\nare closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as that Fund's\n\u201c Cutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with a\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Funds are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFunds will accept the order, subject to each\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once a Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. Each Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, a Fund may reject or revoke a\ncreation order transmitted to it by the\nDistributor or its agent if (i) the order is\nnot in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding shares of\nthe\n\n108\n\nFund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered\ndo not conform to the identity and number of\nshares specified, as described above; (iv)\nacceptance of the Deposit Securities is not\nlegally required or would, in the opinion of\ncounsel, be unlawful; or (v) circumstances\noutside the control of the Fund, the\nDistributor or its agent and BFA make it\nimpracticable to process purchase orders. The\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a\nprospective purchaser of a Creation Unit\nand/or the Authorized Participant acting on\nbehalf of such purchaser of its rejection of\nsuch order. The Funds, BNY Mellon, Citibank or\nJPMorgan, as applicable, the sub-custodian and\nthe Distributor or its agent are under no\nduty, however, to give notification of any\ndefects or irregularities in the delivery of\nFund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any\nliability for failure to give such\nnotification. Issuance of a Creation Unit.\nExcept as provided herein, a Creation Unit\nwill not be issued until the transfer of good\ntitle to the applicable Fund of the Deposit\nSecurities and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the sub-\ncustodian has confirmed to the custodian that\nthe securities included in the Fund Deposit\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant sub-\ncustodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor\nor its agent and BFA shall be notified of such\ndelivery and the applicable Fund will issue\nand cause the delivery of the Creation Unit.\nCreation Units are generally issued on a \u201c T+1\nbasis \u201d ( i.e. , one Business Day after trade\ndate). However, each Fund reserves the right\nto settle Creation Unit transactions on a\ndifferent basis, if necessary or appropriate\nunder the circumstances and compliant with\napplicable law. These circumstances may\ninclude, among others, accommodating non-U.S.\nmarket holiday schedules and accounting for\ndifferent treatment among non-U.S. and U.S.\nmarkets of dividend record dates and ex-\ndividend dates ( i.e., the last day the holder\nof a security can sell the security and still\nreceive dividends payable on the security). To\nthe extent contemplated by an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement with the Distributor,\neach Fund will issue Creation Units to such\nAuthorized Participant, notwithstanding the\nfact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have\nnot been received in part or in whole, in\nreliance on the undertaking of the Authorized\nParticipant to deliver the missing Deposit\nSecurities as soon as possible, which\nundertaking shall be secured by such\nAuthorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\nbuy Deposit Securities for the Funds. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by a Fund or its custodian on\nthe contractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Funds' current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Funds to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Funds of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges. In certain cases,\nAuthorized Participants may create and redeem\nCreation Units on the same trade date and in\nthese instances, the Funds reserve the right\nto settle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by each\nFund and the Fund's determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the\nFunds have retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA,\nto perform certain ETF Services. BRIL will\nreceive from an Authorized Participant a\nstandard transaction fee on each creation\norder, which consists of (1) a fee for\nproviding the ETF Services (the \u201c ETF\nServicing Fee \u201d ) and (2) transfer, processing\nand other transaction costs charged by a Fund\ncustodian in connection with the issuance of\nCreation Units for such creation order ( \u201c\nCustody Transaction Costs \u201d ). BRIL is\nentitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee\npursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but\nBRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction\nCosts to the applicable Fund custodian\naccording to the amounts invoiced by such\ncustodian. The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee\nper order regardless of the number of Creation\nUnits being purchased, which amount will vary\namong different Funds based on a number of\nfactors, including the complexity of the order\nand the types of securities or instruments\nincluded in a Fund\u2019s Creation Basket, among\nother variables. The actual Custody\nTransaction Costs vary per order based on the\nnumber of trades, underlying markets and\nsettlement locations associated with the\nissuance of a Creation Unit. The following\ntable sets forth, for each Fund, either the\nactual creation transaction fee that was\ncharged on July 31, 2024 or an estimate of the\ncreation transaction fee that would have been\ncharged if the Fund had issued a Creation Unit\non that date. The actual fee that was or would\nhave been charged to an Authorized Participant\nin connection with a creation order will vary\nover time depending on the factors discussed\nabove, and may be higher than the fee set\nforth below.\n\n109\n\nIn order to defray transaction expenses for a\nFund and protect against possible shareholder\ndilution, if a creation transaction consists\nsolely or partially of cash, the Authorized\nParticipant may also be required to cover (up\nto the maximum amount shown below) certain\nbrokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution\nand other costs and expenses related to the\nexecution of trades resulting from such\ntransaction (which may, in certain instances,\nbe based on a good faith estimate of\ntransaction costs based on historical data or\nother inputs, at BlackRock\u2019s discretion, and\nmay include part or all of the spread between\nthe expected bid and offer side of the market\nand anticipated market impact). However, a\nFund is not obligated to trade identical\nsecurities to the securities identified by\nBlackRock in estimating these transaction and\nother costs and expenses. In certain cases,\nBlackRock or an affiliate may determine in its\ndiscretion to deviate from the regular charge,\nsubject to the maximum amounts shown below.\nAuthorized Participants will also bear the\ncosts of transferring the Deposit Securities\nto the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated\nwith creation transactions may be waived in\ncertain circumstances. Investors who use the\nservices of a broker or other financial\nintermediary to acquire Fund shares may be\ncharged a fee for such services. The following\ntable sets forth each Fund's actual or\nestimated creation transaction fee, as\napplicable, as of July 31, 2024 and maximum\nadditional charge (as described above):\n

Redemption of\nCreation Units. Shares of a Fund may be\nredeemed by Authorized Participants only in\nCreation Units at their NAV next determined\nafter receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form by the Distributor or its agent\nand only on a Business Day. The Funds will not\nredeem shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits. There can be no assurance, however,\n\n110\n\nthat there will be sufficient liquidity in the\nsecondary market at any time to permit\nassembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should\nexpect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number\nof shares to constitute a Creation Unit that\ncould be redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant. Beneficial owners also may sell\nshares in the secondary market. Each Fund\ngenerally redeems Creation Units for Fund\nSecurities (as defined below). Please see the\nCash Redemption Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the in-kind\nmethod for further information on redeeming\nCreation Units of the Funds. Each Fund\npublishes the designated portfolio of\nsecurities (including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be substituted)\nthat will be applicable to redemption requests\nreceived in proper form (as defined below) on\nthat day ( \u201c Fund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption\nBasket \u201d ), and an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash\nAmount, \u201d as described below) in order to\neffect redemptions of Creation Units of a\nFund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount\nwill remain in effect until such time as the\nnext announced composition of the Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount is made available.\nThe Fund Securities and Cash Amount are\nsubject to possible amendment or correction.\nFund Securities received on redemption may not\nbe identical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Unless cash\nredemptions are available or specified for a\nFund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit generally consist of Fund Securities,\nplus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal\nto the difference between the NAV of the\nshares being redeemed, as next determined\nafter the receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form, and the value of Fund Securities,\nless a redemption transaction fee (as\ndescribed below). The Trust may, in its sole\ndiscretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally\nredeems Creation Units for Fund Securities,\nbut the Funds reserve the right to utilize a\ncash option for redemption of Creation Units.\nEach Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide\nsuch redeeming Authorized Participant a\nportfolio of securities that differs from the\nexact composition of the Fund Securities, but\ndoes not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket\nmay also be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index rebalance to reflect revisions\nthat account for index additions, deletions,\nand re-weights. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\npartial or full cash redemptions of Creation\nUnits of its funds, when partial or full cash\nredemptions of Creation Units are available or\nspecified for a Fund, they will be effected in\nessentially the same manner as in-kind\nredemptions thereof. In the case of partial or\nfull cash redemption, the Authorized\nParticipant receives the cash equivalent of\nthe Fund Securities it would otherwise receive\nthrough an in-kind redemption, plus the same\nCash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\nA standard redemption transaction fee is\nimposed to offset transfer and other\ntransaction costs that may be incurred by the\nrelevant Fund. As described above, under an\nETF Services Agreement, the Funds have\nretained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform\ncertain ETF Services. BRIL will receive from\nan Authorized Participant a standard\ntransaction fee on each redemption order,\nwhich consists of (1) the ETF Servicing Fee\nand (2) Custody Transaction Costs. BRIL is\nentitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee\npursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but\nBRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction\nCosts to the applicable Fund custodian\naccording to the amounts invoiced by such\ncustodian.\n\n111\n\nThe ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee per order\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing redeemed, which amount will vary among\ndifferent Funds based on a number of factors,\nincluding the complexity of the order and the\ntypes of securities or instruments included in\na Fund\u2019s Redemption Basket, among other\nvariables. The actual Custody Transaction\nCosts vary per order based on the number of\ntrades, underlying markets, and settlement\nlocations associated with the redemption of a\nCreation Unit. The following table sets forth,\nfor each Fund, either the actual standard\nredemption transaction fee that was charged on\nJuly 31, 2024 or an estimate of the standard\nredemption transaction fee that would have\nbeen charged if the Fund had redeemed a\nCreation Unit on that date. The actual fee\nthat was or would have been charged to an\nAuthorized Participant in connection with a\nredemption order will vary over time depending\non the factors discussed above, and may be\nhigher than the fee set forth below. In order\nto defray transaction expenses for a Fund and\nprotect against possible shareholder dilution,\nif a redemption transaction consists solely or\npartially of cash, the Authorized Participant\nmay also be required to cover (up to the\nmaximum amount shown below) certain brokerage,\ntax, foreign exchange, execution and other\ncosts and expenses related to the execution of\ntrades resulting from such transaction (which\nmay, in certain instances, be based on a good\nfaith estimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread between the expected bid\nand offer side of the market and anticipated\nmarket impact). However, a Fund is not\nobligated to trade identical securities to the\nsecurities identified by BlackRock in\nestimating these transaction and other costs\nand expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or\nan affiliate may determine in its discretion\nto deviate from the regular charge, subject to\nthe maximum amounts shown below. Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Fund Securities from a Fund\nto their account on their order. Certain\nfees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\ndispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee\nfor such services.

fee. ** Estimated fee.\nPlacement of Redemption Orders. Redemption\nrequests for Creation Units of the Funds must\nbe submitted to the Distributor or its agent\nby or through an Authorized Participant. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable request to redeem shares of a Fund\ngenerally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on\nany Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, a Fund may require\norders to redeem Creation Units to be placed\nearlier that day. Investors, other than\nAuthorized Participants, are responsible for\nmaking arrangements for a redemption request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. The Authorized Participant must\ntransmit the request for redemption in the\nform required by the Funds to the Distributor\nor its agent in accordance with procedures set\nforth in the Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that,\ntherefore, requests to redeem Creation Units\nmay have to be placed by the investor's broker\nthrough an Authorized Participant who has\nexecuted an Authorized Participant Agreement.\nAt any time, only a limited number of broker-\ndealers will have an Authorized Participant\nAgreement in effect. Investors making a\nredemption request should be aware that such\nrequest must be in the form specified by such\nAuthorized Participant. Investors making a\nrequest to redeem Creation Units should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe request by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Funds'\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the applicable\nFund is received by the Distributor or its\nagent from the Authorized Participant on\nbehalf of itself or another redeeming investor\nwithin the time periods specified above; and\n(iii) all other procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement are properly\nfollowed. Upon receiving a redemption request,\nthe Distributor or its agent shall notify the\napplicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent\nof such redemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds are generally made within one\nBusiness Day ( i.e., \u201c T+1 \u201d ). However, each\nFund reserves the right to settle deliveries\nof redemption proceeds on a different basis,\nif necessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliance with applicable\nlaw. These circumstances may include, among\nothers, accommodating non-U.S. market holiday\nschedules and accounting for different\ntreatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of\ndividend record dates and dividend ex-dates (\ni.e., the last date the holder of a security\ncan sell the security and still receive\ndividends payable on the security sold). If\nneither the Authorized Participant nor the\nBeneficial Owner on whose behalf the\nAuthorized Participant is acting has\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nFund Securities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in\n\n113\n\nits discretion exercise its option to redeem\nsuch shares in cash, and the Beneficial Owner\nwill be required to receive its redemption\nproceeds in cash. In such case, the investor\nwill receive a cash payment equal to the net\nasset value of its shares based on the NAV of\nthe relevant Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charges specified above to offset\nthe Fund's brokerage and other transaction\ncosts associated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and each Fund (whether or not it\notherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves\nthe right to redeem Creation Units for cash to\nthe extent that the Fund cannot lawfully\ndeliver specific Fund Securities upon\nredemptions or cannot do so without first\nregistering the Fund Securities under such\nlaws. Although the Trust does not ordinarily\npermit cash redemptions of Creation Units, in\nthe event that cash redemptions are permitted\nor required by the Trust, proceeds will be\npaid to the Authorized Participant redeeming\nshares as soon as practicable after the date\nof redemption (within seven calendar days\nthereafter). If a Fund includes a foreign\ninvestment in its basket, and if a local\nmarket holiday, or series of consecutive\nholidays, or the extended delivery cycles for\ntransferring foreign investments to redeeming\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of the foreign investment in response\nto a redemption request, a Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if a Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant's\nagreement with the Distributor or its agent,\nin the event an Authorized Participant has\nsubmitted a redemption request in proper form\nbut is unable to transfer all or part of the\nCreation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or\nprior to the time specified by a Fund or its\ncustodian on the Business Day after the date\nof submission of such redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by a Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business Day after the date of submission\nof such redemption request and shall be held\nby BNY Mellon, Citibank or JPMorgan, as\napplicable, and marked-to-market daily. The\nfees of BNY Mellon, Citibank or JPMorgan, as\napplicable, and any sub-custodians in respect\nof the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of\nthe collateral shall be payable by the\nAuthorized Participant. The Authorized\nParticipant Agreement permits the Funds to\nacquire shares of the Funds at any time and\nsubjects the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the\naggregate of the cost to the Funds of\npurchasing such shares, plus the value of the\nCash Amount, and the value of the collateral\ntogether with liability for related brokerage\nand other charges. Because the portfolio\nsecurities of a Fund may trade on exchange(s)\non days that the Listing Exchange is closed or\nare otherwise not Business Days for such Fund,\nshareholders may not be able to redeem their\nshares of such Fund or purchase or sell shares\nof such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days\nwhen the NAV of such a Fund could be\nsignificantly affected by events in the\nrelevant non-U.S. markets. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of\npayment postponed with respect to any Fund:\n(i) for any period during which the applicable\nListing Exchange is closed (other than\ncustomary weekend and holiday closings); (ii)\nfor any period during which trading on the\napplicable Listing Exchange is suspended or\nrestricted; (iii) for any period during which\nan emergency exists as a result of which\ndisposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio\nsecurities or determination of its NAV is not\nreasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and each Fund may accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\na Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. Each Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of a Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of a Fund may be taken into\naccount. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for each Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Funds, as set forth in each\nFund's policies and procedures.\n\n114\n\nTaxation on Creations and Redemptions of\nCreation Units. An Authorized Participant\ngenerally will recognize either gain or loss\nupon the exchange of Deposit Securities for\nCreation Units. This gain or loss is\ncalculated by taking the market value of the\nCreation Units purchased over the Authorized\nParticipant\u2019s aggregate basis in the Deposit\nSecurities exchanged therefor. However, the\nIRS may apply the wash sales rules to\ndetermine that any loss realized upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits is not currently deductible. Authorized\nParticipants should consult their own tax\nadvisors. Current U.S. federal income tax laws\ndictate that capital gain or loss realized\nfrom the redemption of Creation Units will\ngenerally create long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Authorized Participant holds the\nCreation Units for more than one year, or\nshort-term capital gain or loss if the\nCreation Units were held for one year or less,\nif the Creation Units are held as capital\nassets. Taxes The following is a summary of\ncertain material U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of a Fund.\nThis summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to a Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Regulated Investment\nCompany Qualifications. Each Fund intends to\nqualify for treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of each\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of each\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of each Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of each\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. A Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests\nand does not timely cure the failure, that\nFund will be taxed in the same manner as an\nordinary corporation and distributions to its\nshareholders will not be deductible by that\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. A\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, a Fund must\ndistribute to its shareholders at least the\nsum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than the\nexcess of its net realized long-term capital\ngain over its net realized short-term capital\nloss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and\n(ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the\n\n115\n\ntaxable year. A Fund will be subject to income\ntax at regular corporate rates on any taxable\nincome or gains that it does not distribute to\nits shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify\nfor any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet\nthe distribution requirement, all of its\ntaxable income will be subject to tax at\nregular corporate income tax rates without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand such distributions generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends\nto the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although\neach Fund intends to distribute substantially\nall of its net investment income and its\ncapital gains for each taxable year, a Fund\nmay decide to retain a portion of its income\nor gains if the Fund determines that doing so\nis in the interest of its shareholders. Each\nFund will be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to\nqualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out\nits earnings and profits accumulated in that\nyear in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a\nFund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two taxable years, the Fund may\nbe required to recognize any net built-in\ngains with respect to certain of its assets (\ni.e., the excess of the aggregate gains,\nincluding items of income, over aggregate\nlosses that would have been realized with\nrespect to such assets if the Fund had been\nliquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Excise Tax. A Fund will be\nsubject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by a Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. Each Fund intends to declare\nand distribute dividends and distributions in\nthe amounts and at the times necessary to\navoid the application of this 4% excise tax.\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards. Net capital\nloss carryforwards may be applied against any\nnet realized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that a Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. The following\nFunds had net capital loss carryforwards, as\nset forth in the table below, as of April 30,\n2024, the tax year-end for the Funds listed:\n                                              \n  Fund                   Non-ExpiringCapital  \n                            LossCarryforward  \n  iShares Cohen &               $203,060,663  \n  Steers REIT ETF                             \n  iShares Core                    26,530,156  \n  Dividend ETF                                \n  iShares Core                 1,009,048,248  \n  Dividend Growth ETF                         \n  iShares Core High            1,580,879,478  \n  Dividend ETF                                \n  iShares Core U.S.               21,772,127  \n  REIT ETF                                    \n  iShares Dow Jones               34,599,904  \n  U.S. ETF                                    \n  iShares Morningstar            236,364,376  \n  Growth ETF                                  \n  iShares Morningstar             92,072,628  \n  Mid-Cap ETF                                 \n  iShares Morningstar            298,363,261  \n  Mid-Cap GrowthETF                           \n  iShares Morningstar             31,958,804  \n  Mid-Cap Value ETF                           \n  iShares Morningstar             37,298,740  \n  Small-Cap ETF                               \n  iShares Morningstar            148,189,608  \n  Small-Cap GrowthETF                         \n  iShares Morningstar             40,914,422  \n  Small-Cap ValueETF                          \n  iShares Morningstar             73,847,118  \n  U.S. Equity ETF                             \n  iShares Morningstar             38,144,056  \n  Value ETF                                   \n  iShares MSCI KLD                95,741,442  \n  400 Social ETF                              \n                                              \n116\n                                              \n  Fund                   Non-ExpiringCapital  \n                            LossCarryforward  \n  iShares MSCI USA               236,097,242  \n  ESG Select ETF                              \n  iShares Select               1,029,155,503  \n  Dividend ETF                                \n  iShares U.S. Basic             205,601,792  \n  Materials ETF                               \n  iShares U.S.                                \n  Consumer                       166,133,707  \n  DiscretionaryETF                            \n  iShares U.S.                                \n  Consumer Staples                65,219,295  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares U.S. Energy            348,471,334  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares U.S.                                \n  Financial Services             153,747,436  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares U.S.                   186,542,054  \n  Financials ETF                              \n  iShares U.S.                   110,482,793  \n  Healthcare ETF                              \n  iShares U.S.                   107,527,418  \n  Industrials ETF                             \n  iShares U.S.                   348,542,647  \n  Technology ETF                              \n  iShares U.S.                   130,557,412  \n  Transportation ETF                          \n  iShares U.S.                    64,494,507  \n  Utilities ETF                               \n                                              \nTaxation of U.S. Shareholders. Dividends and\nother distributions by a Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by a Fund in\nOctober, November or December of any calendar\nyear and payable to shareholders of record on\na specified date in such a month shall be\ndeemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. Each\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if a Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\na Fund reports as capital gains dividends are\ntaxable as long-term capital gains, whether\npaid in cash or in shares and regardless of\nhow long a shareholder has held shares of the\nFund. All other dividends of a Fund (including\ndividends from short-term capital gains) from\nits current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits ( \u201c regular dividends \u201d ) are\ngenerally subject to tax as ordinary income,\nsubject to the discussion of qualified\ndividend income below. Long-term capital gains\nare eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of\n15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders,\ndepending on whether their income exceeds\ncertain threshold amounts. If an individual\nreceives a regular dividend qualifying for the\nlong-term capital gains rates and such\ndividend constitutes an \u201c extraordinary\ndividend, \u201d and the individual subsequently\nrecognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of\nstock in respect of which the extraordinary\ndividend was paid, then the loss will be long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of such\nextraordinary dividend. An \u201c extraordinary\ndividend \u201d on common stock for this purpose is\ngenerally a dividend (i) in an amount greater\nthan or equal to 10% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax\nbasis (or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount\ngreater than 20% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax basis\n(or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin a 365-day period. Distributions in\nexcess of a Fund\u2019s current and accumulated\nearnings and profits will, as to each\nshareholder, be treated as a tax-free return\nof capital to the extent of a shareholder\u2019s\nbasis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital\ngain thereafter (if the\n\n117\n\nshareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets). Distributions in excess of\nthe Fund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements,\nbut not in excess of the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. Shareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on net investment\nincome, including, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates and trusts.\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution may nevertheless be\ntaxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of\nrecord of any security on the record date for\nany dividends payable with respect to such\nsecurity, such dividends will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income not as of the date\nreceived but as of the later of (a) the date\nsuch security became ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividends ( i.e. , the date on which a\nbuyer of the security would not be entitled to\nreceive the declared, but unpaid, dividends);\nor (b) the date the Fund acquired such\nsecurity. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its\nincome distribution requirements, a Fund may\nbe required to pay dividends based on\nanticipated earnings, and shareholders may\nreceive dividends in an earlier year than\nwould otherwise be the case. In certain\nsituations, a Fund may, for a taxable year,\ndefer all or a portion of its net capital loss\n(or if there is no net capital loss, then any\nnet long-term or short-term capital loss)\nrealized after October and its late-year\nordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the\nexcess of post-October foreign currency and\npassive foreign investment company ( \u201c PFIC \u201d\n) losses over post-October foreign currency\nand PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-\nDecember ordinary losses over post-December\nordinary income) until the next taxable year\nin computing its investment company taxable\nincome and net capital gain, which will defer\nthe recognition of such realized losses. Such\ndeferrals and other rules regarding gains and\nlosses realized after October (or December)\nmay affect the tax character of shareholder\ndistributions. Sales of Shares. Upon the sale\nor exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder\nwill realize a taxable gain or loss equal to\nthe difference between the amount realized and\nthe shareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund.\nA redemption of shares by a Fund will be\ntreated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain\nor loss will be treated as capital gain or\nloss if the shares are capital assets in the\nshareholder\u2019s hands and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor more than one year and short-term capital\ngain or loss if the shares are held for one\nyear or less. Any loss realized on a sale or\nexchange will be disallowed to the extent the\nshares disposed of are replaced, including\nreplacement through the reinvesting of\ndividends or capital gains distributions, or\nby an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of a Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, a Fund will be required to withhold at\na 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such\namounts withheld from any distributions paid\nto a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability.\n\n118\n\nSections 351 and 362. The Trust, on behalf of\neach Fund, has the right to reject an order\nfor a purchase of shares of the Fund if the\npurchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon\nobtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or\nmore of the outstanding shares of a given Fund\nand if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would\nhave a basis in the securities different from\nthe market value of such securities on the\ndate of deposit. If a Fund\u2019s basis in such\nsecurities on the date of deposit was less\nthan market value on such date, the Fund, upon\ndisposition of the securities, would recognize\nmore taxable gain or less taxable loss than if\nits basis in the securities had been equal to\nmarket value. It is not anticipated that the\nTrust will exercise the right of rejection\nexcept in a case where the Trust determines\nthat accepting the order could result in\nmaterial adverse tax consequences to a Fund or\nits shareholders. The Trust also has the right\nto require information necessary to determine\nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. Taxation of Certain\nDerivatives. A Fund\u2019s transactions in zero\ncoupon securities, non-U.S. currencies,\nforward contracts, options and futures\ncontracts (including options and futures\ncontracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the\nextent permitted, will be subject to special\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code\n(including provisions relating to \u201c hedging\ntransactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d ) that, among\nother consequences, may affect the character\nof gains and losses realized by the Fund (\ni.e. , may affect whether gains or losses are\nordinary or capital), accelerate recognition\nof income to the Fund and defer Fund losses.\nThese rules could therefore affect the\ncharacter, amount and timing of distributions\nto shareholders. These provisions also (a)\nwill require a Fund to mark-to-market certain\ntypes of the positions in its portfolio ( i.e.\n, treat them as if they were closed out at the\nend of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to\nrecognize income without receiving cash with\nwhich to pay dividends or make distributions\nin amounts necessary to satisfy the\ndistribution requirements for avoiding income\nand excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its\ntransactions, will make the appropriate tax\nelections and will make the appropriate\nentries in its books and records when it\nacquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S.\ncurrency, forward contract, option, futures\ncontract or hedged investment in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and prevent\ndisqualification of a Fund as a RIC. A Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in so-called \u201c Section 1256\ncontracts, \u201d such as regulated futures\ncontracts, most non-U.S. currency forward\ncontracts traded in the interbank market and\noptions on most security indexes, are subject\nto special tax rules. All Section 1256\ncontracts held by a Fund at the end of its\ntaxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in a\nFund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by a Fund from positions in Section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by a Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, a Fund may make\nor receive periodic net payments. A Fund may\nalso make or receive a payment when a swap is\nterminated prior to maturity through an\nassignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if a Fund has been a party to the swap\nfor more than one year). With respect to\ncertain types of swaps, a Fund may be required\nto currently recognize income or loss with\nrespect to future payments on such swaps or\nmay elect under certain circumstances to mark\nsuch swaps to market annually for tax purposes\nas ordinary income or loss. Qualified Dividend\nIncome. Distributions by a Fund of investment\ncompany taxable income (including any short-\nterm capital gains), whether received in cash\nor shares, will be taxable either as ordinary\nincome or as qualified dividend income, which\nis eligible to be taxed at long-term capital\ngain rates to the extent a Fund receives\nqualified dividend income on the securities it\nholds and a Fund reports the distribution as\nqualified dividend income. Qualified dividend\nincome is, in general, dividend income from\ntaxable U.S. corporations (but generally not\nfrom U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S.\ncorporations ( e.g. , non-U.S. corporations\nthat are not PFICs and which are incorporated\nin a possession of the U.S. or in certain\ncountries with a comprehensive tax treaty with\nthe U.S., or the stock of which is readily\ntradable on an established securities market\nin the U.S. (where the dividends are paid with\nrespect to such stock)). Under current IRS\nguidance, the U.S. has appropriate\ncomprehensive income tax treaties with the\nfollowing countries: Australia, Austria,\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria,\nCanada, Chile, China (but not with Hong Kong,\nwhich is treated as a separate jurisdiction\nfor U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech\nRepublic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India,\nIndonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica,\nJapan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania,\nLuxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan,\nthe Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania,\nthe Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa,\nSouth Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago,\nTunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and\nVenezuela. Substitute payments received by a\nFund for securities lent out by a Fund will\nnot be qualified dividend income.\n\n119\n\nA dividend from a Fund will not be treated as\nqualified dividend income to the extent that:\n(i) the shareholder has not held the shares on\nwhich the dividend was paid for 61 days during\nthe 121-day period that begins on the date\nthat is 60 days before the date on which the\nshares become ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe securities it holds that paid the\ndividends distributed to the shareholder (or,\nin the case of certain preferred stocks, the\nholding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) a Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a\nFund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated\nas qualified dividend income only to the\nextent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by a Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by a Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by a Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify\nfor the U.S. federal dividends received\ndeduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum\nholding period during the 90-day period that\nbegins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or\n91-day minimum holding period during the 180\nperiod beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend\ndate for certain preference dividends) during\nwhich risk of loss may not be diminished is\nrequired for the applicable shares, at both\nthe Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend\nto be eligible for the dividends received\ndeduction. Restrictions may apply if\nindebtedness, including a short sale, is\nattributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Funds\nserve to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by\ntheir tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a\nFund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-\nfinanced property in the hands of the tax-\nexempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by a Fund\nfrom REITs, real estate mortgage investment\nconduits, taxable mortgage pools or other\ninvestments may cause the Fund to report some\nor all of its distributions as \u201c excess\ninclusion income. \u201d To Fund shareholders, such\nexcess inclusion income may: (i) constitute\ntaxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders\nwho would otherwise be tax-exempt such as\nindividual retirement accounts, 401(k)\naccounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and\ncertain charitable entities; (ii) not be\noffset by otherwise allowable deductions for\ntax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for\nreduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S.\nshareholders even from tax treaty countries;\nand (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax\nif certain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust. A Fund tries to avoid\ninvesting in REITs that are expected to\ngenerate excess inclusion income, but a Fund\nmay not always be successful in doing so.\nBecause information about a REIT\u2019s investments\nmay be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a\nREIT may change its investment program, a Fund\nmay not be successful in avoiding the\nconsequences described above. Avoidance of\ninvestments in REITs that generate excess\ninclusion income may require a Fund to forego\notherwise attractive investment opportunities.\nNon-U.S. Investments. Under Section 988 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, gains or losses\nattributable to fluctuations in exchange rates\nbetween the time a Fund accrues income or\nreceivables or expenses or other liabilities\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency and the\ntime a Fund actually collects such income or\npays such liabilities are generally treated as\nordinary income or ordinary loss. In general,\ngains (and losses) realized on debt\ninstruments will be treated as Section 988\ngain (or loss) to the extent attributable to\nchanges in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and the currencies in which the\ninstruments are denominated. Similarly, gains\nor losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S.\ncurrency forward contracts and certain\nnon-U.S. currency options or futures contracts\ndenominated in non-U.S. currency, to the\nextent attributable to fluctuations in\nexchange rates between the acquisition and\ndisposition dates, are also treated as\nordinary income or loss unless a Fund was to\nelect otherwise.\n\n120\n\nEach Fund, but in particular the Foreign\nFunds, may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes\nwithheld at the source. Each Fund, if\npermitted to do so, may elect to \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to its investors the amount of\nnon-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund\nprovided that the Fund held the security on\nthe dividend settlement date and for at least\n15 additional days immediately before and/or\nthereafter, with the result that each investor\nwith respect to shares of the Fund held for a\nminimum 16-day holding period at the time of\ndeemed distribution will (i) include in gross\nincome, even though not actually received, the\ninvestor\u2019s pro rata share of the Fund\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct\n(in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only\nfor investors who itemize their deductions on\ntheir personal tax returns) or credit (in\ncalculating U.S. federal income tax) the\ninvestor\u2019s pro rata share of the Fund\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on\ndividends on non-U.S. securities while such\nsecurities are lent out by the Fund are not\neligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through.\nTaxes not \u201c passed through \u201d for tax purposes\nwill not be available to shareholders for\nforeign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person\ninvested in a Fund in a year that the Fund\nelects to \u201c pass through \u201d its non-U.S. taxes\nmay be treated as receiving additional\ndividend income subject to U.S. withholding\ntax. A non-U.S. tax credit may not exceed the\ninvestor\u2019s U.S. federal income tax otherwise\npayable with respect to the investor\u2019s\nnon-U.S. source income. For this purpose,\nshareholders must treat as non-U.S. source\ngross income (i) their proportionate shares of\nnon-U.S. taxes paid by a Fund and (ii) the\nportion of any dividend paid by the Fund that\nrepresents income derived from non-U.S.\nsources; the Fund\u2019s gain from the sale of\nsecurities will generally be treated as\nU.S.-source income. Certain limitations will\nbe imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S.\ntax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares\nare loaned pursuant to securities lending\narrangements, you may lose the ability to use\nany non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a\nFund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while\nthe shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\nwith respect to shares of a Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. Passive Foreign Investment Companies.\nIf a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on a\nportion of any \u201c excess distribution \u201d or gain\nfrom the disposition of such shares even if\nsuch income is distributed as a taxable\ndividend by the Fund to its shareholders.\nAdditional charges in the nature of interest\nmay be imposed on the Fund in respect of\ndeferred taxes arising from such distributions\nor gains. If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC\nand elect to treat the PFIC as a \u201c qualified\nelecting fund \u201d under the Internal Revenue\nCode, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, a\nFund might be required to include in income\neach year a portion of the ordinary earnings\nand net capital gains of the qualified\nelecting fund, even if not distributed to a\nFund, and such amounts would be subject to the\n90% and excise tax distribution requirements\ndescribed above. In order to make this\nelection, a Fund would be required to obtain\ncertain annual information from the PFICs in\nwhich it invests, which may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain. Alternatively, a Fund\nmay make a mark-to-market election that would\nresult in a Fund being treated as if it had\nsold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end\nof each year. In such case, a Fund would\nreport any such gains as ordinary income and\nwould deduct any such losses as ordinary\nlosses to the extent of previously recognized\ngains. The election must be made separately\nfor each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made,\nwould be effective for all subsequent taxable\nyears, unless revoked with the consent of the\nIRS. By making the election, a Fund could\npotentially ameliorate the adverse tax\nconsequences with respect to its ownership of\nshares in a PFIC, but in any particular year\nmay be required to recognize income in excess\nof the distributions it receives from PFICs\nand its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC\nstock. A Fund may have to distribute this \u201c\nphantom \u201d income and gain to satisfy the 90%\ndistribution requirement and to avoid\nimposition of the 4% excise tax. A Fund will\nmake the appropriate tax elections, if\npossible, and take any additional steps that\nare necessary to mitigate the effects of these\nrules. Reporting. If a shareholder recognizes\na loss with respect to a Fund\u2019s shares of $2\nmillion or more for an individual shareholder\nor $10 million or more for a corporate\nshareholder, the shareholder must file with\nthe IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form\n8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio\nsecurities are in many cases exempted from\nthis reporting requirement, but under current\nguidance, shareholders of a RIC are not\nexempted. The fact that a loss is reportable\nunder these regulations does not affect the\nlegal determination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\n\n121\n\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally not subject to such\nwithholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced\nrate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN\nor IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its\nentitlement to benefits under a treaty. The\nwithholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor business within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Properly-reported\ndividends are generally exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax where they (i) are\npaid in respect of a Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net\ninterest income \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S.\nsource interest income, other than certain\ncontingent interest and interest from\nobligations of a corporation or partnership in\nwhich the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder\nor partner, reduced by expenses that are\nallocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term\ncapital gains \u201d (generally, the excess of the\nFund\u2019s net short-term capital gain over the\nFund\u2019s long-term capital loss for such taxable\nyear). However, depending on its\ncircumstances, a Fund may report all, some or\nnone of its potentially eligible dividends as\nsuch qualified net interest income or as\nqualified short-term capital gains and/or\ntreat such dividends, in whole or in part, as\nineligible for this exemption from\nwithholding. In order to qualify for this\nexemption from withholding, a non-U.S.\nshareholder will need to comply with\napplicable certification requirements relating\nto its non-U.S. status (including, in general,\nfurnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of\nshares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if a Fund\nreports the payment as qualified net interest\nincome or qualified short-term capital gain.\nNon-U.S. shareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts. Special\nrules may apply to a foreign shareholder\nreceiving a Fund distribution if at least 50%\nof the Fund's assets consist of interests in\nU.S. real property interests, including\ncertain REITs and U.S. real property holding\ncorporations (as defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund\ndistributions that are attributable to gain\nfrom the disposition of a U.S. real property\ninterest will be taxable as ordinary dividends\nand subject to withholding at a 30% or lower\ntreaty rate if the foreign shareholder held no\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time\nduring the one-year period ending on the date\nof the distribution. If the foreign\nshareholder held more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares, the distribution would be treated as\nincome effectively connected with a trade or\nbusiness within the U.S. and the foreign\nshareholder would be subject to withholding\ntax at a rate of 21% and would generally be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences would generally\napply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the\nsale of Fund shares unless the Fund is\ndomestically controlled (meaning that more\nthan 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is\nheld by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign\nshareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of sale. Finally, a\ndomestically controlled Fund may be required\nto recognize a portion of its gain on the in-\nkind distribution of certain U.S. real\nproperty interests. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund. A foreign\nshareholder also may be subject to certain \u201c\nwash sale \u201d rules to prevent the avoidance of\nthe tax filing and payment obligations\ndiscussed above through the sale and\nrepurchase of Fund shares. Shareholders that\nare nonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in a Fund. Separately, a\n30% withholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to: (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to\n\n122\n\naccount holders who fail to provide the\nrequired information; and determine certain\nother information concerning their account\nholders, or (ii) in the event an\nintergovernmental agreement and implementing\nlegislation are adopted, provide local revenue\nauthorities with similar account holder\ninformation. Other foreign entities may need\nto report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. Shares of a Fund held by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder at death will be\nconsidered situated within the U.S. and\nsubject to the U.S. estate tax. The foregoing\ndiscussion is a summary of certain material\nU.S. federal income tax considerations only\nand is not intended as a substitute for\ncareful tax planning. Purchasers of shares\nshould consult their own tax advisors as to\nthe tax consequences of investing in such\nshares, including consequences under state,\nlocal and non-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date of this SAI. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.

Correspondence\nshould be addressed to iShares Board of\nTrustees, c/o BlackRock Fund Advisors, iShares\nFund Administration, 400 Howard Street, San\nFrancisco, CA 94105. Shareholder\ncommunications to the Board should include the\nfollowing information: (i) the name and\naddress of the shareholder; (ii) the number of\nshares owned by the shareholder; (iii) the\nFund(s) of which the shareholder owns shares;\nand (iv) if these shares are owned indirectly\nthrough a broker, financial intermediary or\nother record owner, the name of the broker,\nfinancial intermediary or other record owner.\nAll correspondence received as set forth above\nshall be reviewed by the Secretary of the\nTrust and reported to the Board.\n\n123\n\nRegulation Under the Alternative Investment\nFund Managers Directive. The Alternative\nInvestment Fund Managers Directive ( \u201c AIFMD \u201d\n) imposes detailed and prescriptive\nobligations on fund managers established in\nthe EU ( \u201c EU Operative Provisions \u201d ). These\ndo not currently apply to managers established\noutside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU\nmanagers are only required to comply with\ncertain disclosure, reporting and transparency\nobligations of AIFMD ( \u201c AIFMD Disclosure\nProvisions \u201d ) if such managers market a fund\nto EU investors. Where the AIFMD Disclosure\nProvisions relate to EU Operative Provisions\nthat do not apply to BFA, no meaningful\ndisclosure can be made. These EU Operative\nProvisions include prescriptive rules on:\nmeasuring and capping leverage in line with\nknown European standards; the treatment of\ninvestors; the use of \u201c depositaries \u201d ; and\ncoverage for professional liability risks.\nAIFMD imposes certain conditions on the\nmarketing of funds, such as the Funds, to EU\ninvestors. AIFMD requires that an \u2018alternative\ninvestment fund manager\u2019 ( \u201c AIFM \u201d ) be\nidentified to meet such conditions where such\nmarketing is sought. For these purposes BFA,\nas the legal entity responsible for performing\nthe portfolio and risk management of the\nFunds, shall be the AIFM. AIFMD requires\ndisclosure on an ongoing basis of certain\ninformation relating to the use of special\narrangements, leverage, rights of reuse of\ncollateral, guarantees granted under leverage\narrangements and the use of gates, side\npockets and similar liquidity management\ntools. Given that the Funds do not use any\nspecial arrangements or allow for collateral\nreuse, it is not intended that such\ndisclosures will need to be made by the Funds.\nEach Fund will, however, to the extent\nrelevant and appropriate, disclose in its\nannual report information on the Fund's\nleverage, risk profile and risk management\nsystems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also\ndisclose material changes, if any, to the\nliquidity management systems and procedures\nemployed in respect of the Fund. BFA has\nregistered the following Fund for marketing to\ninvestors in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden,\nand the U.K.: iShares Select Dividend ETF\nInvestors\u2019 Rights. Each Fund relies on the\nservices of BFA and its other service\nproviders, including the Distributor,\nadministrator, custodian and transfer agent.\nFurther information about the duties and roles\nof these service providers is set out in this\nSAI. Investors who acquire shares of a Fund\nare not parties to the relevant agreement with\nthese service providers and do not have\nexpress contractual rights against the Fund or\nits service providers, except certain\ninstitutional investors that are Authorized\nParticipants may have certain express\ncontractual rights with respect to the\nDistributor under the terms of the relevant\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Investors\nmay have certain legal rights under federal or\nstate law against a Fund or its service\nproviders. In the event that an investor\nconsiders that it may have a claim against a\nFund, or against any service provider in\nconnection with its investment in a Fund, such\ninvestor should consult its own legal advisor.\nBy contract, Authorized Participants\nirrevocably submit to the non-exclusive\njurisdiction of any New York State or U.S.\nfederal court sitting in New York City over\nany suit, action or proceeding arising out of\nor relating to the Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Jurisdiction over other claims,\nwhether by investors or Authorized\nParticipants, will turn on the facts of the\nparticular case and the law of the\njurisdiction in which the proceeding is\nbrought.\n\n124\n\nAppendix A - iShares ETFs Proxy Voting\nPolicies Open-End Fund Proxy Voting Policy\nProcedures Governing Delegation of Proxy\nVoting to Fund Advisers Effective Date: August\n1, 2021 Last Review Date: August 25, 2023\nOpen-End Mutual Funds (including money market\nfunds) Exchange-Traded Funds Objective and\nScope Set forth below is the Open-End Fund\nProxy Voting Policy. Policy/Document\nRequirements and Statements The Boards of\nTrustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d ) of open-\nend funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d ) advised by\nBlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors,\nLLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ), have the responsibility\nfor the oversight of voting proxies relating\nto portfolio securities of the Funds, and have\ndetermined that it is in the best interests of\nthe Funds and their shareholders to delegate\nthe responsibility to vote proxies to\nBlackRock, subject to the principles outlined\nin this Policy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s\nauthority to manage, acquire and dispose of\naccount assets, all as contemplated by the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment management\nagreements. BlackRock has adopted guidelines\nand procedures (together and as from time to\ntime amended, the \u201c BlackRock proxy voting\nguidelines \u201d ) governing proxy voting by\naccounts managed by BlackRock.

We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals.
