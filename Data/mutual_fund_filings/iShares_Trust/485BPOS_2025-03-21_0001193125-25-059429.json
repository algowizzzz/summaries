Fees and\nExpenses The following table\ndescribes the fees and expenses\nthat you will incur if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund.\nThe investment advisory agreement\nbetween iShares Trust (the \u201c\nTrust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c\nInvestment Advisory Agreement \u201d )\nprovides that BFA will pay all\noperating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees,\n(ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition\nand disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of\nportfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v)\ndistribution fees or expenses,\nand (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. The\nFund may incur \u201c Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses. \u201d Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses reflect\nthe Fund\u2019s pro rata share of the\nfees and expenses incurred\nindirectly by the Fund as a\nresult of investing in other\ninvestment companies. The impact\nof Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses is included in the\nFund\u2019s total return but is not\nincluded in the Fund\u2019s ratio of\nexpenses to average net assets.\nBoth figures are shown in the\nFinancial Highlights section of\nthe Fund\u2019s prospectus (the \u201c\nProspectus \u201d ).BFA, the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund,\nhas contractually agreed to waive\na portion of its management fees\nin an amount equal to the\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nif any, attributable to\ninvestments by the Fund in other\nfunds advised by BFA or its\naffiliates through the\ntermination date of the Fund, on\nor about December 15, 2055. The\ncontractual waiver may be\nterminated prior to the Fund\u2019s\ntermination only upon the written\nagreement of the Trust and BFA.\nYou may pay other fees, such as\nbrokerage commissions and other\nfees to financial intermediaries,\nwhich are not reflected in the\ntables and examples below.\n                                              \n       Annu\u2026                                  \n       Fund                                   \n       Oper\u2026                                  \n       Expe\u2026                                  \n       expe\u2026                                  \n       that                                   \n       you                                    \n       pay                                    \n       each                                   \n       year                                   \n       as                                     \n       aper\u2026                                  \n       of                                     \n       the                                    \n       value                                  \n       of                                     \n       your                                   \n       inve\u2026                                  \n       Dist\u2026        Acqu\u2026  Tot\u2026  Fee    Tot\u2026  \n  Ma\u2026  (12b\u2026  Oth\u2026  Fund\u2026  Ann\u2026  Waiv\u2026  Ann\u2026  \n                                        Wai\u2026  \n  0.\u2026  None   0.0\u2026  0.00%  0.0\u2026  (0.0\u2026  0.0\u2026  \n                                              \nS-1\n\n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA\nunder the Investment Advisory\nAgreement exclude Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, if any. 2 The\namount rounded to 0.00% 3 Based\non estimated amounts for the\ncurrent fiscal year. Example.\nThis Example is intended to help\nyou compare the cost of owning\nshares of the Fund with the cost\nof investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest\n$10,000 in the Fund for the time\nperiods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of\nthose periods. Fund expenses (and\nany applicable waivers) are\ncalculated only through December\n15, 2055 because the Fund is\nscheduled to cease operations and\nliquidate by that date. The\nExample also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each\nyear and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs\nmay be higher or lower, based on\nthese assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                   \n  1 Year  3 Years  \n  $7          $23  \n                   \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may\npay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes\nwhen Fund shares are held in a\ntaxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. Because the Fund is\nnew, there is no reportable\nturnover. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to meet\nits investment objective\ngenerally by investing in\nindividual securities which\nsatisfy the criteria of the ICE\n2055 Maturity US Treasury Index\n(the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index consists of\npublicly-issued U.S. Treasury\nsecurities that are scheduled to\nmature between January 1, 2055\nand December 15, 2055, inclusive.\nThe Fund may also invest in\nshort-term paper, cash and cash\nequivalents, including shares of\nmoney market funds advised by BFA\nor its affiliates. The Fund is a\nterm fund that will terminate on\nor about December 15, 2055, at\nwhich time it will distribute its\nremaining net assets to\nshareholders pursuant to a plan\nof liquidation. The Fund does not\nseek to return any predetermined\namount at maturity or in periodic\ndistributions. Qualifying\nsecurities are U.S. Treasury\nnotes and bonds having $1 billion\nor more of outstanding face\nvalue, excluding amounts held by\nthe Federal Reserve System Open\nMarket Account ( \u201c SOMA \u201d ). In\naddition, the securities in the\nUnderlying Index must have a\nfixed coupon schedule and be\ndenominated in U.S. dollars.\nExcluded from the Underlying\nIndex are inflation-linked\nsecurities, Treasury bills and\nSeparate Trading of Registered\nInterest and Principal of\nSecurities (STRIPS). However, the\namounts outstanding of qualifying\nsecurities in the Underlying\nIndex are not reduced by any\nindividual components of such\nsecurities ( i.e. , coupon or\nprincipal) that have been\nstripped after inclusion in the\nS-2\n\nUnderlying Index. Securities\nissued or marketed primarily to\nretail investors do not qualify\nfor inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex. The Underlying Index is\nmarket value-weighted based on\namounts outstanding reduced by\namounts held by the Federal\nReserve SOMA times price plus\naccrued interest. Accrued\ninterest is calculated assuming\nnext-day settlement. The\nUnderlying Index is rebalanced on\nthe last calendar day of the\nmonth, based on information\navailable up to and including the\nthird business day before the\nlast business day of the month.\nNew issues must settle on or\nbefore the following calendar\nmonth end rebalancing date in\norder to qualify for inclusion\nfor such following month ( e.g. ,\nan issue must settle on or before\nNovember 30 in order to be\nincluded in the index on October\n31). The securities in the\nUnderlying Index are updated on\nthe last calendar day of each\nmonth. Cash flows from bond\npayments that are received during\nthe month are retained in the\nUnderlying Index until the end of\nthe month and then are removed as\npart of the rebalancing. When\ncash or a security is removed as\npart of the rebalancing, it\neffectively increases the\nweighting of the remaining\nsecurities in the Underlying\nIndex, and the Fund is required\nto invest in the remaining\nsecurities to bring its holdings\nin line with the Underlying\nIndex. Cash does not earn any\nreinvestment income while it is\nheld in the Underlying Index. The\nFund will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component\nsecurities of the Underlying\nIndex, and the Fund will invest\nat least 90% of its assets in\nU.S. Treasury securities that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track\nthe Underlying Index, in each\ncase except as described below.\nThe Fund will invest no more than\n10% of its assets in futures,\noptions and swaps contracts that\nBFA believes will help the Fund\ntrack the Underlying Index. Cash\nand cash equivalent investments\nassociated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part\nof that position for the purposes\nof calculating the percentage of\ninvestments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks\nto track the investment results\nof the Underlying Index before\nfees and expenses of the Fund. In\nthe last six months of operation,\nas the bonds held by the Fund\nmature, the proceeds will\ntypically be reinvested by the\nFund in investments already in\nthe Underlying Index but may also\nbe invested in other cash and\ncash equivalents as determined by\nBFA. To the extent that the Fund\ninvests in money market or\nsimilar funds, it will incur the\nfees and expenses of such funds.\nBy December 15, 2055, the Fund is\nexpected to consist almost\nentirely of cash. On or around\nthis date, the Fund will wind up\nand terminate. After appropriate\nprovision is made for any Fund\nliabilities, its net assets will\nbe distributed to then-current\nshareholders pursuant to a plan\nof liquidation. The Fund's\ntermination was approved by a\nmajority of the Trust's Board of\nTrustees (the \u201c Board \u201d ) and\ndoes not require additional\napproval by Fund shareholders.\nThe Board may extend the\ntermination date if a majority of\nthe Board determines the\nextension to be in the best\ninterest of the Fund. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to\nachieve the Fund\u2019s investment S-3\nobjective. The Fund does not try\nto \u201c beat \u201d the index it tracks\nand does not seek temporary\ndefensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued.\nIndexing may eliminate the chance\nthat the Fund will substantially\noutperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the\nrisks of active management, such\nas poor security selection.\nIndexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep\nportfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an\napplicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected\nto have, in the aggregate,\ninvestment characteristics (based\non factors such as market value\nand industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability, duration (\ni.e. , a security's price\nsensitivity to a change in\ninterest rates), maturity or\ncredit ratings and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not\nhold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund may\nlend securities representing up\nto one-third of the value of the\nFund's total assets (including\nthe value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index\nis owned, maintained and\nadministered by ICE Data Indices,\nLLC (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c\nIDI \u201d ), which is independent of\nthe Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition and relative\nweightings of the securities in\nthe Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding\nthe market value of the\nUnderlying Index. Summary of\nPrincipal Risks As with any\ninvestment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the\nFund, and the Fund's performance\ncould trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject\nto certain risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share\n( \u201c NAV \u201d ), trading price,\nyield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective.\nCertain key risks are prioritized\nbelow (with others following in\nalphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk\nis difficult to predict and may\nchange over time. You should\nreview each risk factor\ncarefully. U.S. Treasury\nObligations Risk. U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other\nsecurities in their interest\nrates, maturities, times of\nissuance and other\ncharacteristics and may provide\nrelatively lower returns than\nthose of other securities.\nChanges in the U.S. government\u2019s\nfinancial condition or credit\nrating may cause the value of\nU.S. Treasury obligations to\ndecline. Direct obligations of\nthe U.S. Treasury have\nhistorically involved little risk\nof loss of principal if held to\nmaturity, but the market value of\nsuch securities is not guaranteed\nand may fluctuate. Although U.S.\nTreasury obligations are backed\nby the full faith and credit of\nthe United States, circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or\nprincipal. Interest Rate Risk .\nInterest rate risk refers to the\nrisk of fluctuations in the value\nof a fixed-income security due to\nchanges in the general level of\ninterest S-4 rates. Interest rate\nchanges can be sudden and\nunpredictable and are influenced\nby a number of factors, including\ngovernment policy, monetary\npolicy, inflation expectations,\nperceptions of risk, and supply\nand demand for fixed-income\nsecurities. An increase in\ninterest rates generally will\ncause the value of fixed-income\nsecurities to decline. Securities\nwith longer maturities generally\nare more sensitive to interest\nrate changes and subject to\ngreater fluctuations in value.\nChanges in interest rates may\nhave unpredictable effects on\nfixed-income markets and result\nin heightened volatility and\nlower liquidity for certain\ninstruments, which may adversely\naffect a Fund\u2019s performance.\nDuring periods of very low or\nnegative interest rates, a Fund\nmay be unable to maintain\npositive returns or pay dividends\nto shareholders. Market Risk .\nThe Fund could lose money over\nshort periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional\nor global events such as war,\nacts of terrorism, pandemics or\nother public health issues,\nrecessions, the prospect or\noccurrence of a sovereign default\nor other financial crisis, or\nother events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund\nand its investments and could\nresult in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nIndex-Related Risk. The Index\nProvider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess\nthe criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources\nof information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included\ncomponents or will result in the\nFund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying\nIndex in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the\nIndex Provider may not identify\nor correct them promptly or at\nall, which may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural\ndisasters, political unrest or\nwar) may impact the Index\nProvider or a third-party data\nprovider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets\nin the Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to financial\nmarkets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index,\nor other asset classes. Assets\nUnder Management (AUM) Risk .\nFrom time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below in\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk ), a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, or another fund\nmay invest in the Fund and hold\nits investment for a specific\nperiod of time to allow the Fund\nto achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such\nentity would not redeem its\ninvestment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at\nsuch levels, which could\nnegatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d is a\nmember or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with\nthe SEC, which S-5 has a written\nagreement with the Fund or one of\nits service providers that allows\nthe Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and\nredemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number\nof institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the\nFund, including on an agency\nbasis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation\nor redemption orders for the Fund\nand no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor delisting. Concentration Risk.\nThe Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are concentrated in\nthe securities or other assets of\none or more issuers, countries or\nother geographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. Cybersecurity Risk\n. Failures or breaches of the\nelectronic systems of the Fund,\nits adviser, distributor, Index\nProvider, other service\nproviders, counterparties, or\nissuers of assets in which the\nFund invests may cause\ndisruptions that negatively\nimpact the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans and risk management systems\nseeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are\ninherent limitations in such\nplans and systems. The Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. In\naddition, cyber incidents may\nadversely impact the issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests, which may cause such\ninvestments to lose value.\nDeclining Yield Risk. During the\nsix months prior to the Fund\u2019s\nplanned termination date, the\nFund\u2019s yield may move toward\nprevailing money market rates and\nmay be lower than the yields of\nthe bonds previously held by the\nFund and lower than prevailing\nyields for bonds in the market.\nIncome Risk. The Fund's income\nmay decline if interest rates\nfall. This decline in income can\noccur because the Fund may\nsubsequently invest in lower-\nyielding bonds as bonds in its\nportfolio mature or are near\nmaturity, or bonds in the\nUnderlying Index are substituted,\nor the Fund otherwise needs to\npurchase additional bonds. As the\nFund does not seek to return any\npredetermined amount at maturity\nor in periodic distributions, the\namount of income generated by the\nFund may vary during its term.\nIssuer Risk . The performance of\nthe Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to\nwhich the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other\nassets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a\nwhole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Management Risk .\nThe Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive\npositions under any market\nconditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund S-6 will not\nfully replicate the Underlying\nIndex and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject\nto the risk that the investment\nstrategy of BFA may not produce\nthe intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces\nnumerous market trading risks,\nincluding the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares\n(including through a trading\nhalt), losses from trading in\nsecondary markets, periods of\nhigh volatility, and disruptions\nin the process of creating and\nredeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may\nlead to the Fund\u2019s shares trading\nin the secondary market at a\npremium or discount to NAV or to\nthe intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy\nFund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a premium to\nNAV or sell Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\ndiscount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the\nunderlying value of the Fund\nshares. Operational Risk . The\nFund is exposed to operational\nrisks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not\nlimited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or\ninadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce\nthese operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Investing\nin U.S. issuers subjects the Fund\nto legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic\nrisks that are specific to the\nU.S. Certain changes in the U.S.,\nsuch as a weakening of the U.S.\neconomy or a decline in its\nfinancial markets, may have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return\nthe securities in a timely manner\nor at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse\ntax consequences for the Fund.\nSmall Fund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s\nsize is small, the Fund may\nexperience low trading volume and\nwide bid/ask spreads. In\naddition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if it does\nnot meet certain requirements set\nby the listing exchange. Any\nresulting liquidation of the Fund\ncould lead to elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund\nand negative tax consequences for\nits shareholders. Tracking Error\nRisk . The Fund may be subject to\n\u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error\nmay occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other\nassets held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index; differences\nin the timing and S-7\nmethodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets;\ntransaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund\nthat the Underlying Index does\nnot incur; the Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash; differences in\nthe timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund\nshareholders; tax gains or\nlosses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment; portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of\ncustom baskets; changes to the\nUnderlying Index; and impacts to\nthe Fund of complying with\ncertain regulatory requirements\nor limits. Tracking error risk\nmay be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nUntil the Fund reaches greater\nscale, it may experience higher\ntracking error than is typical\nfor similar index ETFs.\nPerformance Information As of the\ndate of the Prospectus, the Fund\nhas not commenced operations and\ntherefore has no performance\ninformation to report. S-8\nManagement Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors.\nPortfolio Managers. James Mauro\nand Karen Uyehara (the \u201c\nPortfolio Managers \u201d ) are\nprimarily responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the\nFund. Each Portfolio Manager\nsupervises a portfolio management\nteam. Mr. Mauro and Ms. Uyehara\nhave been Portfolio Managers of\nthe Fund since inception (2025).\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares\nThe Fund is an ETF. Individual\nshares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (a premium) or\nless than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs\nattributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase\nshares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling\nshares in the secondary market\n(the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to\nmake distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income\nor capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan\nor an individual retirement\naccount ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in which\ncase, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when\nwithdrawn. Certain states and\nlocalities may exempt from tax\ndistributions attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal\ngovernment obligations. Payments\nto Broker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you\npurchase shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a\nbank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing\nactivities and presentations,\neducational training programs,\nconferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and\nreporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the\nbroker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson\nto recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your\nfinancial intermediary\u2019s website\nfor more information.

The market\nprice for a share of the Fund may\nbe different from the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. The Fund invests in a\nparticular segment of the markets\nfor securities and other\ninstruments (as applicable) and\nis designed to be used as part of\nbroader asset allocation\nstrategies. Accordingly, an\ninvestment in the Fund should not\nconstitute a complete investment\nprogram. An investment in the\nFund is not a bank deposit, and\nit is not insured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, any other government\nagency, BFA or any of BFA\u2019s\naffiliates. Index Funds A share\nof the Fund represents an\nownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of\nsecurities and other instruments\n(as applicable) that is intended\nto track the Fund\u2019s Underlying\nIndex. An index is a financial\ncalculation, based on a grouping\nof financial instruments, and is\nnot an investment product, while\nthe Fund is an actual investment\nportfolio. The performance of the\nFund and that of its Underlying\nIndex may vary for a number of\nreasons, including transaction\ncosts, asset or currency\nvaluations, corporate actions,\ntiming variances and differences\nbetween the composition of the\nFund\u2019s portfolio and that of the\nUnderlying Index resulting from\nthe Fund\u2019s use of representative\nsampling or from legal\nrestrictions (such as\ndiversification requirements)\nthat apply to the Fund but not to\nits Underlying Index. From time\nto time, the provider of the\nUnderlying Index ( \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ) may make changes to\nthe index methodology or other\nadjustments to the Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index. Unless\notherwise determined by BFA, any\nsuch change will be reflected in\nthe calculation of the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s performance on a going-\nforward basis after the effective\ndate of such change. Therefore,\nthe performance of the Underlying\nIndex that\n\n1\n\nis shown for periods prior to the\neffective date of any such change\ngenerally will not be\nrecalculated or restated to\nreflect the change. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Funds. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of the\napplicable underlying index.\nBecause the Funds use\nrepresentative sampling, they can\nbe expected to have a larger\ntracking error than if they used\na replication indexing strategy.\n\u201c Replication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests\nin substantially all of the\nsecurities in its underlying\nindex in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying\nindex. Additional Information\nAbout the Fund's Risks Each Fund\nis subject to various risks, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s NAV, trading price, yield,\ntotal return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. Each\nFund discloses its portfolio\nholdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. You could lose\nall or part of your investment in\na Fund, which could underperform\nother investments. The principal\nand other (non-principal) risks\nthat apply to the Fund are\ndescribed below. A Fund that\ninvests in an underlying fund ( \u201c\nUnderlying Fund \u201d ) also may be\nindirectly exposed to these risks\nthrough such investment.\nPrincipal Risks Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets\nin a Fund\u2019s portfolio or, if\napplicable, its Underlying Index\nmay underperform in comparison to\nindexes that track, or assets\nthat represent, other countries\nor geographic units, industries,\nmarkets, market segments, or\nasset classes. Various types of\nsecurities, other assets and\nindexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and\nunderperformance in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally. This\ndivergence may be due to a number\nof factors including, among other\nthings, inflation, interest\nrates, productivity, global\ndemand for local products or\nresources, and regulation and\ngovernmental controls. This may\ncause a Fund to underperform\nother investment vehicles that\ninvest in different asset\nclasses. Assets Under Management\n(AUM) Risk. From time to time, an\nAuthorized Participant, a third-\nparty investor, a Fund\u2019s adviser,\nan affiliate of a Fund\u2019s adviser,\nor another fund may invest in a\nFund and hold its investment for\na specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or\nscale. There can be no assurance\nthat any such entity would not\nredeem its investment or that the\nsize of the Fund would be\nmaintained at such levels, which\ncould negatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number\nof institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the\nFund, including on an agency\nbasis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation\nor redemption orders for the Fund\nand no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor 2 delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk\nmay be heightened for a Fund that\ninvests in securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers or instruments\nwith lower trading volume. Such\nassets often entail greater\nsettlement and operational\ncomplexity and higher capital\ncosts for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the\nnumber of Authorized Participants\nthat engage with the Fund.\nConcentration Risk. A Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk\nof loss, including losses due to\nadverse events that affect the\nFund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent\nthat the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or\nother assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. A Fund with\ninvestment concentration may be\nmore adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets,\nmay experience greater price\nvolatility and may be more\nsusceptible to adverse economic,\nmarket, political or regulatory\nimpacts on those assets compared\nto a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments.\nCybersecurity Risk. A Fund and\nentities that interact with the\nFund are susceptible to\noperational, information security\nand related cybersecurity risks,\nboth directly and through their\nservice providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to,\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, distributor,\nother service providers ( e.g .,\nindex and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer\nagents and administrators),\ncounterparties, market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market\noperators, and governmental\nauthorities. Cybersecurity risks\nare also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in\nwhich a Fund invests, which could\nresult in material adverse\nconsequences for such issuers and\nmay cause the Fund\u2019s investment\nin such issuers to lose value.\nCyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or\nunintentional events. They\ninclude, but are not limited to,\ngaining unauthorized access to\nsystems, misappropriating assets\nor sensitive information,\ncorrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational\ndisruption. Geopolitical tensions\nmay increase the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate\nattacks, particularly those from\nnation-states or from entities\nwith nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause\ndisruptions and impact business\noperations and may result in any\nof the following: financial\nlosses, interference with a\nFund\u2019s ability to calculate its\nNAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to\ntrading, submission of erroneous\ntrades or erroneous creation or\nredemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service\nproviders to transact business,\nviolations of applicable privacy\nand other laws, regulatory fines,\npenalties, reputational damage,\nreimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other\nlegal and compliance expenses. In\naddition, cyber incidents may\nrender records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder\nownership of Fund shares, and\nother data integral to a Fund\u2019s\nfunctioning inaccessible,\ninaccurate or incomplete. A Fund\nmay incur substantial costs in\norder to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. Each Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent,\ncyber incidents. However, there\nare inherent limitations in such\nplans and systems, including the\npossibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that\nprevention and remediation\nefforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go\nundetected. Furthermore, a Fund\ncannot control the 3\ncybersecurity plans and systems\nof its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third\nparties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. A Fund and its\nshareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Declining\nYield Risk. During the months\nprior to the Fund's planned\ntermination date, the Fund\u2019s\nyield may move toward prevailing\nmoney market rates, and may be\nlower than the yields of the\nbonds previously held by the Fund\nand lower than prevailing yields\nfor bonds in the market. Income\nRisk. The Fund\u2019s income may\ndecline if interest rates fall.\nThis decline in income can occur\nbecause the Fund may subsequently\ninvest in lower-yielding\ninstruments as bonds in its\nportfolio mature or are near\nmaturity, or bonds in the\nUnderlying Index are substituted,\nor the Fund otherwise needs to\npurchase additional bonds. As the\nFund does not seek to return any\npredetermined amount at maturity\nor in periodic distributions, the\namount of income generated by the\nFund may vary during its term.\nIndex-Related Risk. A Fund that\ntracks an Underlying Index seeks\nto achieve a return that\ncorresponds generally to the\nprice and yield performance,\nbefore fees and expenses, of its\nUnderlying Index as published by\nthe Index Provider. There is no\nassurance that the Index Provider\nor its agents will construct or\ncalculate the Underlying Index\naccurately. While the Index\nProvider describes what the\nUnderlying Index is designed to\nachieve, neither the Index\nProvider nor its agents provide\nany warranty or accept any\nliability regarding the quality,\naccuracy or completeness of the\nUnderlying Index or its related\ndata, and they do not guarantee\nthat the Underlying Index will be\nin line with the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology. BFA also does not\nprovide any warranty or guarantee\nagainst the Index Provider\u2019s or\nany agent\u2019s errors. The Index\nProvider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess\nthe criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates.\nNeither a Fund nor BFA can offer\nassurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources\nof information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included\ncomponents or will result in the\nFund meeting its investment\nobjective. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the\nconstruction of an Underlying\nIndex in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the\nIndex Provider may not identify\nor correct them promptly or at\nall, particularly for indexes\nthat are less commonly used as\nbenchmarks. In addition, there\nmay be heightened risks\nassociated with the adequacy and\nreliability of information about\nemerging markets constituents, as\nsuch markets may have less\ninformation available or less\nregulatory oversight. Errors\nrelated to an Underlying Index\nmay negatively or positively\nimpact a Fund and its\nshareholders. For example, if the\nUnderlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund\nwill have exposure to such\nconstituents and will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s other constituents.\nShareholders should understand\nthat any gains from an Index\nProvider\u2019s errors will be kept by\nthe Fund and its shareholders and\nany losses or costs from such\nerrors will be borne by the Fund\nand its shareholders. Unusual\nmarket conditions or other\nunforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political\nunrest or war) may impact an\nIndex Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to an 4\nUnderlying Index. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. If a scheduled\nrebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that would otherwise\nbe removed at the rebalance (due\nto, for example, changes in\nmarket capitalization or issuer\ncredit ratings) may remain,\ncausing the performance and\nconstituents of the Underlying\nIndex to vary from those expected\nunder normal conditions. In\naddition, to the extent\ncircumstances evolve between\nperiodic index reviews and\nreconstitutions, an Underlying\nIndex may include constituents\nthat do not align with its\nobjective or selection criteria,\nand the Fund tracking the\nUnderlying Index may be similarly\naffected. In addition to\nscheduled rebalances, an Index\nProvider or its agents may carry\nout ad hoc index rebalances due\nto reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market\nconditions, corporate events, or\ncorrections of errors. The\nrelevant Fund will in turn\nrebalance its portfolio to\nattempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the portfolio\nand the Underlying Index. The\nFund and its shareholders will\ndirectly bear any transaction\ncosts and market exposure from\nsuch portfolio rebalancing.\nTherefore, index-related errors\nand ad hoc rebalances may\nincrease a Fund\u2019s costs and\ntracking error. Interest Rate\nRisk. Interest rate changes can\nbe sudden and unpredictable and\nare influenced by a number of\nfactors, including government\npolicy, monetary policy,\ninflation expectations,\nperceptions of risk, and supply\nand demand for fixed-income\nsecurities. Changes in interest\nrates may have unpredictable\neffects on fixed-income markets\nand may result in heightened\nvolatility and lower liquidity\nfor certain instruments, which\nmay adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nperformance. When interest rates\nrise, the value of fixed-income\nsecurities or other instruments\nsensitive to interest rates\ntypically decreases. Duration is\na measure of how sensitive a bond\nis to interest rate changes.\nFixed-income securities with\nlonger durations tend to be more\nsensitive to interest rate\nchanges, and their prices usually\nare more volatile than those of\nshorter-duration securities. For\nexample, if a bond has a duration\nof five years and interest rates\nrise, the price of the bond will\nlikely decline by a greater\npercentage than for a bond with a\none-year duration. To the extent\na Fund invests a substantial\nportion of its assets in fixed-\nincome securities with longer\nduration, rising interest rates\nmay cause the value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments to decline\nsignificantly, which would\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. In addition, changes\nin prevailing interest rates,\nparticularly sudden and\nsignificant changes, may lead to\nfluctuations in the value of\nfloating-rate debt securities,\nbecause the rates for those\nsecurities typically reset only\nperiodically. Additionally,\nduring periods of very low or\nnegative interest rates, a Fund\nmay be unable to maintain\npositive returns or pay dividends\nto shareholders. Under certain\nmarket conditions when interest\nrates are set at low levels and\nthe market prices of portfolio\nsecurities have increased, a Fund\nmay have a very low or even\nnegative yield, which would cause\nthe Fund to lose money under\ncertain conditions. Decreases in\nmarket-making capacity for fixed-\nincome dealers may lead to lower\ntrading volume, heightened\nvolatility, wider bid-ask spreads\nand less transparent pricing in\ncertain fixed-income markets.\nIssuer Risk. The performance of a\nFund depends on the performance\nof individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has\nexposure. The value of securities\nor 5 other assets may decline, or\nperform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes\nin the financial condition or\ncredit rating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Management Risk.\nThe Fund invests in securities or\nother assets included in, or\nrepresentative of, its Underlying\nIndex, regardless of their\ninvestment merits. The Fund may\nbe affected by a general decline\nin market segments related to its\nUnderlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to\ninvest the Fund\u2019s assets in\ndefensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including\ndeclining markets. Market\ndisruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an\nadverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nability to adjust its exposure to\nthe required levels in order to\ntrack its Underlying Index.\nBecause BFA uses a representative\nsampling indexing strategy, the\nFund will not fully replicate its\nUnderlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not\nincluded in the Underlying Index.\nAs a result, the Fund is subject\nto the risk that BFA\u2019s investment\nstrategy, whose implementation is\nsubject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the\nintended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of its Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\nRisk. A Fund could lose money\nover short periods due to short-\nterm market movements and over\nlonger periods during more\nprolonged market downturns. The\nvalue of a financial instrument\nor other asset may decline due to\nchanges in general market\nconditions, economic trends or\nevents that are not specifically\nrelated to the particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors\nthat affect one or more issuers,\ncounterparties, exchanges,\ncountries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or\nasset classes. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts\nof terrorism, pandemics or other\npublic health issues, recessions,\nthe prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact\non a Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased\npremiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Changes in market and\neconomic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all\ntypes of instruments and assets.\nMarket Trading Risk. A Fund faces\nnumerous market trading risks,\nany of which may lead to its\nshares trading in the secondary\nmarket at a premium or discount\nto NAV or to the intraday value\nof the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nIf you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\npremium to NAV or sell Fund\nshares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to the\nNAV, you may pay significantly\nmore or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of\nthe Fund shares. Absence of an\nActive Primary Market. Although\nFund shares are listed for\ntrading on one or more stock\nexchanges, there can be no\nassurance that an active primary\ntrading market for Fund shares\nwill develop or be maintained by\nmarket makers or Authorized\nParticipants. Secondary Listing\nRisks. A Fund\u2019s shares may be\nlisted or traded on U.S. and\nnon-U.S. stock exchanges other\nthan the U.S. stock exchange\nwhere the Fund\u2019s primary listing\nis maintained. Fund shares also\nmay be available to non-U.S.\ninvestors through funds or\nstructured investment vehicles\nsimilar to depositary receipts.\nThere can be no assurance that a\nFund\u2019s shares will continue to\ntrade on any such stock exchange\nor in any market or that a Fund\u2019s\nshares will continue to meet the\nrequirements for exchange listing\nor market trading. A Fund\u2019s\nshares may be less actively\ntraded in 6 certain markets than\nin others, and investors are\nsubject to the execution and\nsettlement risks and market\nstandards of the market where\nthey or their broker direct their\ntrades for execution. Certain\ninformation that is available to\ninvestors who trade Fund shares\non a U.S. stock exchange during\nregular U.S. market hours may not\nbe available to investors who\ntrade in other markets, which may\nresult in secondary market prices\nin such markets being less\nefficient. Secondary Market\nTrading Risk. Shares of a Fund\nmay trade in the secondary market\nat times when the Fund does not\naccept orders to create or redeem\nshares. At such times, shares may\ntrade in the secondary market\nwith more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might be\nexperienced at times when the\nFund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities\nheld by a Fund may be traded in\nmarkets that close at a different\ntime than an exchange on which\nFund shares are traded. Liquidity\nin those securities may be\nreduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during\nthe time when the exchange is\nopen but after the applicable\nmarket closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be\nwider bid/ask spreads on the\nexchange and a greater premium or\ndiscount to NAV. In stressed\nmarket conditions, the market for\na Fund\u2019s shares may become less\nliquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the\nmarkets for the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings, and an investor may be\nunable to sell their Fund shares.\nSecondary market trading in Fund\nshares may be halted by a stock\nexchange because of market\nconditions or for other reasons.\nIn times of extraordinary market\nvolatility, Fund shares may be\nsubject to trading halts pursuant\nto \u201c circuit breaker \u201d rules of a\nstock exchange or market. If\nthere is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an\nexchange or market, an investor\nmay be unable to purchase or sell\nFund shares. In addition, if\ntrading in certain securities or\nfinancial instruments is\nrestricted, this may disrupt a\nFund\u2019s creation/redemption\nprocess, affect the price at\nwhich Fund shares trade in the\nsecondary market, and result in a\nFund being unable to trade\ncertain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such\ncircumstances, a Fund may be\nunable to rebalance its portfolio\nor accurately price its portfolio\nholdings and may incur\nsubstantial trading losses.\nShares of a Fund, similar to\nshares of other issuers listed on\na stock exchange, may be sold\nshort and are therefore subject\nto the risk of increased\nvolatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short.\nIn addition, trading activity in\nderivative products based on a\nFund may lead to increased\ntrading volume and volatility in\nthe secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares\nMay Trade at Prices Other Than\nNAV . Shares of a Fund trade on\nstock exchanges at prices at,\nabove or below the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. A Fund\u2019s NAV is\ncalculated at the end of each\nbusiness day and fluctuates with\nchanges in the market value of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nThe trading price of a Fund\u2019s\nshares fluctuates throughout\ntrading hours based on both\nmarket supply of and demand for\nFund shares and the underlying\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the\ntrading prices of a Fund\u2019s shares\nmay deviate significantly from\nNAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant\nredemption requests, or other\nunusual market conditions 7\nHowever, because Fund shares can\nbe created and redeemed in\nCreation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or\npremiums to a Fund\u2019s NAV are not\nlikely to be sustained over the\nlong term (unlike shares of many\nclosed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While\nthe creation/redemption feature\nis designed to make it more\nlikely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock\nexchanges at prices close to the\nFund\u2019s next calculated NAV,\nexchange prices are not expected\nto correlate exactly with the\nFund\u2019s NAV due to timing reasons,\nsupply and demand imbalances and\nother factors. In addition,\ndisruptions to creations and\nredemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, or other\nmarket participants, and during\nperiods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading\nprices for shares of a Fund that\ndiffer significantly from its\nNAV. Authorized Participants may\nbe less willing to create or\nredeem a Fund\u2019s shares if there\nis a lack of an active market for\nsuch shares or the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying investments, which may\ncontribute to the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or\nSelling Fund Shares. Buying or\nselling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of\ncosts that apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares\nthrough a broker, you will likely\nincur a brokerage commission and\nother charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c\nspread, \u201d which is the difference\nbetween what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares\n(the \u201c bid \u201d price) and the price\nat which they are willing to sell\nFund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price).\nThe spread varies over time for\nFund shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity. It\nis generally narrower if a Fund\nhas more trading volume and\nmarket liquidity and wider if a\nFund has less trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. Increased\nmarket volatility also may cause\nwider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other\ncharges that are incurred as a\nresult of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in\nbuying or selling Fund shares,\nfrequent trading may detract\nsignificantly from investment\nresults, and an investment in\nFund shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate\nregularly making small\ninvestments through a brokerage\naccount. Operational Risk. Each\nFund is exposed to operational\nrisks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not\nlimited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or\ninadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures.\nEach Fund and BFA seek to reduce\nthese operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S. Investing\nin U.S. issuers involves legal,\nregulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that\nare specific to the U.S. A\ndecrease in imports or exports,\nchanges in trade regulations,\ninflation, an economic recession,\nfinancial system stress, or\npolitical turmoil, among other\nrisks, may have an adverse effect\non the U.S. economy and the\nsecurities listed on U.S.\nexchanges. The U.S. is also\nsubject to the risk of natural\ndisasters, such as droughts,\nearthquakes, fires and floods.\nU.S. security risks include acts\nof terrorism, internal unrest and\na deterioration in relations\nbetween the U.S. and certain\ncountries. Any of these may\nadversely affect the U.S.\neconomy, financial markets or\nissuers. 8 Governmental agencies\nproject that the U.S. will\nmaintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable\nfuture. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily\nindicate or cause economic\nproblems, the costs of servicing\nsuch debt may constrain future\neconomic growth. Circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or\nprincipal on U.S. government\ndebt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system.\nSecurities Lending Risk. A Fund\nmay engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the\nrisk that a Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return\nthe securities in a timely manner\nor at all. A Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline\nin the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or\na decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for a Fund. Small\nFund Risk. When a Fund\u2019s size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience\nlow trading volume and wide\nbid/ask spreads. In addition, a\nFund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if it does not meet\ncertain requirements set by the\nlisting exchange. If a Fund were\nrequired to delist from the\nlisting exchange, the Fund\u2019s\nvalue may rapidly decline and its\nperformance may be negatively\nimpacted. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could\nlead to elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its\nshareholders. Tracking Error\nRisk. A Fund that tracks an index\nis subject to the risk of \u201c\ntracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of a Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error\nmay occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other\nassets held in a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nand those included in the\nUnderlying Index; differences in\nthe timing and methodologies used\nto value securities and other\nassets; transaction costs and\nother expenses incurred by a Fund\nthat the Underlying Index does\nnot incur; a Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash; differences in\nthe timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by a Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund\nshareholders; tax gains or\nlosses; the requirements for a\nFund to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment; portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of\ncustom baskets; changes to the\nUnderlying Index, such as during\na rebalancing or reconstitution;\nand impacts to a Fund of\ncomplying with certain regulatory\nrequirements or limits. A Fund\nthat tracks an index composed of\na large number of securities or\nother assets may experience\ngreater tracking error than a\nFund that tracks a more narrow\nindex. Tracking error risk may be\nheightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nU.S. Treasury Obligations Risk.\nU.S. Treasury obligations may\ndiffer from other securities in\ntheir interest rates, maturities,\ntimes of issuance and other\ncharacteristics. Direct\nobligations of the U.S. Treasury\nhave historically involved little\nrisk of loss of principal if held\nto maturity, but the market value\nof such securities is not\nguaranteed and may fluctuate.\nAlthough U.S. Treasury\nobligations are backed by the\nfull faith and credit of the\nUnited States, circumstances (\ne.g ., reaching the legislative \u201c\ndebt ceiling \u201d ) could arise that\ncould prevent the timely payment\nof interest or principal. An\nactual or threatened failure of\nthe U.S. government to pay its\nobligations 9 would result in\nlosses to a Fund holding such\nsecurities as well as substantial\nnegative consequences for the\nU.S. economy and the global\nfinancial system. Changes in the\nU.S. government\u2019s financial\ncondition or credit rating may\ncause the value of U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Because\nU.S. government debt obligations\nare often used as a benchmark for\nother borrowing arrangements, a\ndowngrade to the credit rating of\nthe U.S. could result in higher\ninterest rates for a range of\nborrowers, cause disruptions in\nthe international bond markets\nand have a substantial adverse\neffect on the U.S. and global\neconomies. A high national debt\nlevel may increase market\npressures to meet government\nfunding needs, which may drive\ndebt costs higher and lead the\ngovernment to issue additional\ndebt, thereby increasing\nrefinancing risk. A high national\ndebt also raises concerns that\nthe U.S. government will not be\nable to make principal or\ninterest payments when they are\ndue. If market participants\ndetermine that U.S. sovereign\ndebt levels are unsustainable,\nthe value of the U.S. dollar\ncould decline, thus increasing\ninflationary pressures and\nconstraining the U.S.\ngovernment\u2019s ability to implement\neffective countercyclical fiscal\npolicy in economic downturns.\nOther Risks The order of the\nbelow risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Close-Out\nRisk for Qualified Financial\nContracts. Regulations adopted by\nglobal prudential regulators\nrequire counterparties that are\npart of U.S. or foreign global\nsystemically important banking\norganizations to include\ncontractual restrictions on\nclose-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified\nfinancial contracts. Qualified\nfinancial contracts include\nagreements relating to swaps,\ncurrency forwards and other\nderivatives as well as repurchase\nagreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions\nprevent a Fund from closing out a\nqualified financial contract\nduring a specified time period if\nthe counterparty is subject to\nresolution proceedings and also\nprohibit a Fund from exercising\ndefault rights due to a\nreceivership or similar\nproceeding of an affiliate of the\ncounterparty. These requirements\nmay increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. Illiquid\nInvestments Risk. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that\na Fund reasonably expects cannot\nbe sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without\nsignificantly changing the market\nvalue of the investment. An\ninvestment may be illiquid due\nto, among other things, fewer\nparticipants or less capacity to\nmake a market in the investment,\nthe lack of an active market for\nthe investment, capital controls,\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof local currency, and the\ninsolvency of local governments.\nTo the extent that a Fund invests\nin securities or other assets\nwith substantial market and/or\ncredit risk, the Fund will tend\nto have increased exposure to the\nrisks associated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid investments\nmay be harder to value,\nespecially in changing markets.\nLiquid investments may become\nilliquid after purchase by a\nFund, particularly during periods\nof market turmoil. There can be\nno assurance that a security or\nother asset that is deemed to be\nliquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long\nas it is 10 held by a Fund, and\nany security or other asset held\nby a Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to\nthe Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. Holdings of\nilliquid investments may reduce a\nFund\u2019s returns because the Fund\nmay be unable to transact at\nadvantageous times or prices. If\na Fund is forced to sell\nunderlying investments at reduced\nprices or under unfavorable\nconditions to meet redemption\nrequests or for other cash needs,\nthe Fund may suffer a loss. This\nmay be magnified in a rising\ninterest rate environment or\nother circumstances where\nredemptions of Fund shares may be\ngreater than normal. If other\nmarket participants attempt to\nliquidate holdings at the same\ntime as a Fund, this will lead to\nan increased supply of the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying investments in the\nmarket and contribute to greater\nilliquid investments risk and\ndownward pricing pressure. In\naddition, if a Fund is limited in\nits ability to sell illiquid\ninvestments during periods when\nshareholders are redeeming their\nshares, the Fund will need to\nsell liquid securities to meet\nredemption requests, and illiquid\nsecurities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings.\nDuring periods of market\nvolatility, liquidity in the\nmarket for a Fund\u2019s shares may be\nimpacted by the liquidity in the\nmarket for the underlying\nsecurities or other assets held\nby the Fund, which could lead to\nthe Fund\u2019s shares trading at a\npremium or discount to the Fund's\nNAV. Large Shareholder and Large-\nScale Redemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders of a Fund, including\nan Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, a market maker,\nor another entity, may from time\nto time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares\nor may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of\ntime. These shareholders may also\npledge or loan Fund shares (to\nsecure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares\nbecoming concentrated in another\nparty. There can be no assurance\nthat any large shareholder or\nlarge group of shareholders would\nnot redeem their investment or\nthat the size of a Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares may\nadversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the\nextent a Fund permits redemptions\nin cash, these redemptions may\nforce the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when\nit might not otherwise do so,\nwhich may negatively impact the\nFund\u2019s NAV, have a material\neffect on the market price of\nFund shares, increase the Fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income\nand/or capital gains, and cause\nthe Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders\nearlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under\ncertain circumstances, non-\nredeeming shareholders may be\ntreated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable\ndistribution during or with\nrespect to such tax year. A Fund\nalso may be required to sell its\nmore liquid investments to meet a\nlarge redemption, in which case\nthe Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile,\nand more difficult to price. To\nthe extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund\nshares on the secondary market,\nsuch transactions may account for\na large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may,\ntherefore, have a material upward\nor downward effect on the market\nprice of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares\nmay adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to the extent that\nthe Fund is delayed in investing\nnew cash and is required to\nmaintain a larger cash position\nthan it ordinarily would,\ndiluting its investment returns.\n11 Ownership Limitations Risk. If\ncertain aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel ownership thresholds are\nreached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates\nor a Fund, or as a result of\nthird-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or\nregulator, the ability of BFA and\nits affiliates on behalf of\nclients (including a Fund) to\npurchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or\nundertake business transactions\nmay be restricted by law,\nregulation or rules or otherwise\nimpaired. The capacity of a Fund\nto invest in certain securities\nor other assets may be affected\nby the relevant threshold limits,\nand such limitations may have\nadverse effects on the liquidity\nand performance of a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. For example,\nownership limits may apply to\nsecurities whose issuers operate\nin certain regulated industries\nor in certain international\nmarkets. Such limits also may\napply where the investing entity\n(such as a Fund) is subject to\ncorporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions or invests in\ncertain futures or other\nderivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate\nand/or fund-level amounts\ninvested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for client funds and\naccounts managed by BFA\n(including a Fund) may not exceed\nthe relevant limits without the\ngrant of a license or other\nregulatory or corporate approval,\norder, consent, relief or non-\ndisapproval. However, there is no\nguarantee that permission will be\ngranted or that, once granted, it\nwill not be modified or revoked\nat a later date with minimal or\nno notice. In other cases,\nexceeding such thresholds may\ncause BFA and its affiliates, a\nFund or other client accounts to\nsuffer disadvantages or business\nrestrictions. Ownership\nlimitations are highly complex.\nIt is possible that, despite\nBFA\u2019s intent to either comply\nwith or be granted permission to\nexceed ownership limitations, it\nmay inadvertently breach a limit\nor violate the corporate or\nregulatory approval, order,\nconsent, relief or non-\ndisapproval that was obtained.\nPortfolio Holdings Information A\ndescription of the policies and\nprocedures with respect to the\ndisclosure of the Funds\u2019\nportfolio securities and other\nassets (as applicable) is\navailable in the applicable\nStatement of Additional\nInformation ( \u201c SAI \u201d ). Each\nFund discloses its portfolio\nholdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. Fact sheets\nproviding information about each\nFund\u2019s top holdings are posted on\nwww.iShares.com when available\nand may be requested by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\nManagement of the Fund Investment\nAdviser As investment adviser,\nBFA has overall responsibility\nfor the general management and\nadministration of the Funds. BFA\nprovides an investment program\nfor the Funds and manages the\ninvestment of the Funds\u2019 assets.\nIn seeking to achieve the Funds\u2019\nrespective investment objectives,\nBFA uses teams of portfolio\nmanagers, investment strategists\nand other investment specialists\nand may draw upon the trading,\nresearch and expertise of its\naffiliates. This team approach\nbrings together many disciplines\nand leverages BFA\u2019s extensive\nresources. 12\n\nBFA is an indirect wholly owned\nsubsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. ( \u201c\nBlackRock \u201d ) and is located at\n400 Howard Street, San Francisco,\nCA 94105. As of December 31,\n2024, BFA and its affiliates\nprovided investment advisory\nservices for assets of\napproximately $11.6. From time to\ntime, an employee of BlackRock\nmay express views regarding a\nparticular security or other\ninstrument, asset class, company,\nindustry, or market sector. Such\nviews are the views of only that\nindividual as of the time\nexpressed. They do not\nnecessarily represent the views\nof BlackRock or any other person\nwithin the BlackRock\norganization. Such views may\nchange at any time based upon\nmarket or other conditions, and\nBlackRock has no responsibility\nto update such views. You should\nnot rely on any such views as\ninvestment advice or as an\nindication of trading intent on\nbehalf of a Fund. Fees and\nExpenses Pursuant to the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nbetween BFA and the Trust\n(entered into on behalf of the\nFunds), BFA is responsible for\nsubstantially all expenses of the\nFund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition\nof portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses\nand any extraordinary expenses\n(as determined by a majority of\nthe Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the\nTrust). Operating expenses paid\nby BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nif any. A discussion regarding\nthe basis for the approval by the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201c\nBoard \u201d ) of the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement with BFA will\nbe available in the Fund's Form\nN-CSR filed with the SEC for the\nperiod ending April 30, 2025 and\nin the applicable financial\nstatements and additional\ninformation documents posted at\nwww.iShares.com. For its\ninvestment advisory services to\nthe Fund, BFA is paid a\nmanagement fee from the Fund, as\na percentage of the Fund\u2019s\naverage daily net assets, net of\nany applicable waivers, at the\nannual rate set forth in the\ntable below. If BFA has\ncontractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fees\nfor a Fund, the contractual\nwaiver may be terminated prior to\nits expiration date only upon\nwritten agreement of the Trust\nand BFA. In addition, BFA may\nfrom time to time voluntarily\nwaive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce a Fund\u2019s total\nannual fund operating expenses\n(excluding Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses, if any). Any such\nvoluntary waiver or reimbursement\nmay be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime.\n                                              \n  Fund                        Management Fee  \n  iShares iBonds Dec 2055     0.07%1          \n  Term TreasuryETF                            \n                                              \n1 BFA has contractually agreed to\nwaive a portion of its management\nfees in an amount equal to the\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nif any, attributable to\ninvestments by the Fund in other\nfunds advised by BFA or its\naffiliates through the\ntermination date of the Fund. The\ncontractual waiver may be\nterminated prior to the Fund\u2019s\ntermination only upon the written\nagreement of the Trust and BFA.\n\n13\n\nPortfolio Managers The Portfolio\nManagers for the Fund are\nresponsible for various functions\nrelated to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninvesting cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of\ntheir respective portfolio\nmanagement teams to focus on\ncertain asset classes,\nimplementing investment strategy,\nresearching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and\noverseeing members of their\nrespective teams who have more\nlimited responsibilities. James\nMauro and Karen Uyehara are\nprimarily responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the\nFund. James Mauro has been\nemployed by BFA or its affiliates\nas a portfolio manager since\n2011. He is a Managing Director\nof BlackRock, Inc. Karen Uyehara\nhas been employed by BFA or its\naffiliates as a portfolio manager\nsince 2010.

BFA and its\nAffiliates are involved worldwide\nwith a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset\nmanagement activities and in the\nordinary course of business may\nengage in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests\nof other clients may conflict\nwith those of a Fund. BFA and its\nAffiliates act, or may act, as an\ninvestor, research provider,\ninvestment manager, commodity\npool operator, commodity trading\nadvisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index\nprovider, agent and/or principal.\nBFA and its Affiliates may have\nother direct and indirect\ninterests in securities,\ncurrencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other assets in\nwhich a Fund may directly or\nindirectly invest. BFA and its\nAffiliates may engage in\nproprietary trading and advise\naccounts and other funds that\nhave investment objectives\nsimilar to those of a Fund and/or\nthat engage in and compete for\ntransactions in the same or\nsimilar types of securities,\ncurrencies and other assets as\nare held by a Fund. This may\ninclude transactions in\nsecurities issued by other open-\nend and closed-end investment\ncompanies, including investment\n\n14\n\ncompanies that are affiliated\nwith the Fund and BFA, to the\nextent permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940,\nas amended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ).\nThe trading activities of BFA and\nits Affiliates are carried out\nwithout reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by a\nFund. These activities may result\nin BFA or an Affiliate having\npositions in assets that are\nsenior or junior to, or that have\ninterests different from or\nadverse to, the assets held by a\nFund. A Fund may invest in\nsecurities issued by, or engage\nin other transactions with,\nentities with which an Affiliate\nhas significant debt or equity\ninvestments or other interests. A\nFund may also invest in issuances\n(such as debt offerings or\nstructured notes) for which an\nAffiliate is compensated for\nproviding advisory, cash\nmanagement or other services. A\nFund also may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in other\ntransactions with, entities for\nwhich an Affiliate provides or\nmay provide research coverage or\nother analysis. An Affiliate may\nhave business relationships with,\nand receive compensation from,\ndistributors, consultants or\nothers who recommend a Fund or\nwho engage in transactions with\nor for a Fund. Neither BlackRock\nnor any Affiliate is under any\nobligation to share any\ninvestment opportunity, idea or\nstrategy with a Fund. As a\nresult, an Affiliate may compete\nwith a Fund for appropriate\ninvestment opportunities. The\nresults of a Fund\u2019s investment\nactivities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of\nother accounts managed by an\nAffiliate. It is possible that a\nFund could sustain losses during\nperiods in which one or more\nAffiliates and other accounts\nachieve profits on their trading\nfor proprietary or other\naccounts. The opposite result is\nalso possible. In addition, a\nFund may enter into transactions\nin which BFA or an Affiliate or\ntheir directors, officers,\nemployees or clients have an\nadverse interest. A Fund may be\nadversely impacted by the effects\nof transactions undertaken by BFA\nor an Affiliate or their\ndirectors, officers, employees or\nclients. From time to time,\nBlackRock or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and\naccounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law,\npurchase and hold shares of a\nFund. The price, availability,\nliquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of a Fund may be\nimpacted by purchases and sales\nof the Fund by BlackRock or its\nadvisory clients. A Fund\u2019s\nactivities may be limited because\nof regulatory restrictions\napplicable to BFA or an Affiliate\nor their policies designed to\ncomply with such restrictions.\nUnder a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board,\nthe Funds have retained BTC, an\nAffiliate of BFA, to serve as\ntheir securities lending agent to\nthe extent that they participate\nin the securities lending\nprogram. For these services, the\nsecurities lending agent will\nreceive a fee from the\nparticipating Fund based on the\nreturns earned on the Fund\u2019s\nlending activities, including\ninvestment of the cash received\nas collateral for the loaned\nsecurities. In addition, one or\nmore Affiliates may be among the\nentities to which a Fund may lend\nits portfolio securities under\nthe securities lending program.\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement,\ncertain Funds have retained\nBlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an\nAffiliate of BFA, to perform\ncertain 15 order processing,\nAuthorized Participant\ncommunications, and related\nservices in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of\nCreation Units ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d\n). BRIL will retain a portion of\nthe standard transaction fee\nreceived from Authorized\nParticipants on each creation or\nredemption order from the\nAuthorized Participant for the\nETF Services provided. BlackRock\ncollaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c\nCitibank \u201d ) on the design and\ndevelopment of the ETF Services\nplatform. Citibank may have, or\nfrom time to time may develop,\nadditional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates. BlackRock and\nits Affiliates may benefit from a\nFund using a BlackRock index by\ncreating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indexes.\nBlackRock and its Affiliates are\nnot obligated to license an index\nto a Fund, and no Fund is under\nan obligation to use a BlackRock\nindex. The terms of a Fund\u2019s\nindex licensing agreement with\nBlackRock or its Affiliates may\nnot be as favorable as the terms\noffered to other licensees. The\nactivities of BFA and its\nAffiliates and their respective\ndirectors, officers or employees\nmay give rise to other conflicts\nof interest that could\ndisadvantage a Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted\npolicies and procedures designed\nto address these potential\nconflicts of interest. Please see\nthe SAI for further information.\nShareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy\nand sell shares of the Funds, is\navailable free of charge by\ncalling toll-free 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting\nwww.iShares.com. Buying and\nSelling Shares Transactions in\nshares of the Funds occur in the\nprimary market and the secondary\nmarket. Primary market\ntransactions, known as \u201c\ncreations \u201d and \u201c redemptions, \u201d\noccur only between the Funds and\nAuthorized Participants ( i.e .,\nfinancial institutions that are\nauthorized to participate in such\ntransactions), as described in\nthe Creations and Redemptions\nsection below. Fund shares are\nlisted on U.S. national\nsecurities exchanges, where they\ncan be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day at market prices,\nlike shares of other publicly\ntraded companies. A Fund\u2019s shares\nmay also be available in other\nsecondary markets, such as on\nnon-U.S. exchanges and through\nfunds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary\nreceipts. The Funds do not impose\nany minimum investment for Fund\nshares purchased on an exchange\nor otherwise in the secondary\nmarket. Buying or selling Fund\nshares on an exchange or other\nsecondary market generally\ninvolves two types of costs that\nare common in securities\ntransactions. First, when buying\nor selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. The\ncommission is frequently a fixed\namount; it may be a significant\nproportional cost if you are\nseeking to buy or sell small\namounts of shares. Second, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c\nspread, \u201d which is any difference\nbetween the bid price and the ask\nprice for the shares. The spread\nvaries over time based on a\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market\nliquidity. Generally, the spread\nis smaller if a Fund has high\ntrading volume and market\nliquidity, and larger if a Fund\nhas lower trading volume and\nmarket 16 liquidity. The latter\nis often the case for newly\nlaunched or smaller funds. A\nFund\u2019s spread may also be\nimpacted by the liquidity (or\nlack thereof) of the underlying\nsecurities or other assets held\nby the Fund, particularly for\nnewly launched or smaller funds,\nor by instances of significant\nvolatility of the underlying\nassets. The U.S. national\nsecurities exchanges that list\nFund shares are open for trading\nMonday through Friday and are\nclosed on weekends and the\nfollowing holidays (or the days\non which they are observed): New\nYear\u2019s Day, Martin Luther King,\nJr. Day, Presidents\u2019 Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Investments in Investment\nCompanies Section 12(d)(1) of the\n1940 Act generally restricts\ninvestments by investment\ncompanies, including foreign and\nunregistered investment\ncompanies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For\nexample, a registered investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Funds, may not\nknowingly sell or otherwise\ndispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any\ninvestment company (the \u201c\nAcquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company\nor companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately\nafter such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the\nAcquired Fund is owned by the\nAcquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund, or (ii) more than\n10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund\nand other investment companies\nand companies controlled by them.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing,\nregistered investment companies\nare permitted to invest in a Fund\nbeyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to\ncertain terms and conditions set\nforth in Rule 12d1-4 under the\n1940 Act. To make such an\ninvestment in an Acquired Fund, a\nregistered investment company\nmust, among other things, enter\ninto an agreement with the Trust.\nIf an Acquired Fund invests\nsignificantly in other registered\ninvestment companies in reliance\non Rule 12d1-4, an Acquiring Fund\nwill not be permitted to rely on\nRule 12d1-4 and invest in the\nFund beyond the Section 12(d)(1)\nlimits. Any investment company\ninterested in purchasing shares\nof a Fund beyond the limits set\nforth in Section 12(d)(1) should\ncontact BFA. Foreign investment\ncompanies are permitted to invest\nin a Fund only up to the limits\nset forth in Section 12(d)(1),\nsubject to any applicable SEC no-\naction relief. Book Entry Shares\nof the Funds are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no\nstock certificates are issued.\nThe Depository Trust Company ( \u201c\nDTC \u201d ), which serves as the\nsecurities depository for shares\nof the Funds, or its nominee is\nthe record owner of, and holds\nlegal title to, all outstanding\nshares of the Funds. Investors\nowning Fund shares are beneficial\nowners as shown on the records of\nDTC or its participants. DTC\nparticipants include securities\nbrokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations\nand other institutions that\ndirectly or indirectly maintain a\ncustodial relationship with DTC.\nAs a beneficial owner of Fund\nshares, you are not entitled to\nreceive physical delivery of\nstock certificates or to have\nshares registered in your name,\nand you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares. 17\nTherefore, to exercise any right\nas an owner of Fund shares, you\nmust rely upon the procedures of\nDTC and its participants. These\nprocedures are the same as those\nthat apply to any other\nsecurities held in book-entry or\n\u201c street name \u201d form. Share\nPrices The trading prices of a\nFund\u2019s shares in the secondary\nmarket generally differ from the\nFund\u2019s daily NAV and are affected\nby various factors, such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF\nshares and the securities or\nother assets held by a Fund as\nwell as other market and economic\nconditions. Determination of Net\nAsset Value The NAV of a Fund\nnormally is determined once daily\nMonday through Friday, on each\nday that the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) is open for\ntrading. The NAV generally is\ndetermined as of the close of the\nNYSE\u2019s regular trading hours,\nnormally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,\nbased on prices at the time of\nclosing. Any Fund assets or\nliabilities that are denominated\nin currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market\nrates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data\nservice providers. The NAV of a\nFund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s net\nassets ( i.e ., the value of its\ntotal assets, including the value\nof any underlying fund shares in\nwhich the Fund invests, less\ntotal liabilities) by the total\nnumber of outstanding shares of\nthe Fund, generally rounded to\nthe nearest cent. The value of a\nFund\u2019s assets and liabilities is\ndetermined pursuant to BFA\u2019s\nvaluation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the\nInvestment Company Act. Equity\nsecurities and other equity\ninstruments for which market\nquotations are readily available\nare valued at market value, which\nis generally determined using the\nlast reported official closing\nprice or, if a reported closing\nprice is not available, the last\ntraded price on the exchange or\nmarket on which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at\nthe time of valuation. Shares of\nunderlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds)\nthat are not traded on an\nexchange are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying ETFs\nand closed-end funds that trade\non exchanges are valued at their\nmost recent market closing price.\nFixed-income securities are\nvalued using last available bid\nprices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or\nprices (including evaluated\nprices) supplied by the Funds\u2019\napproved independent third-party\npricing services, each in\naccordance with BFA\u2019s valuation\npolicies and procedures. Pricing\nservices may use matrix pricing\nor valuation models that utilize\ncertain inputs and assumptions to\nderive values. Pricing services\ngenerally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly\ntransactions of an institutional\nround lot size, but a Fund may\nhold or transact in such\nsecurities in smaller odd lot\nsizes. Odd lots often trade at\nlower prices than institutional\nround lots. An amortized cost\nmethod of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations\nwith 60 days or less remaining to\nmaturity unless BFA determines in\ngood faith that such method does\nnot represent fair value. 18\nGenerally, trading in certain\ninstruments ( e.g ., non-U.S.\nsecurities, money market\ninstruments, etc.) is\nsubstantially completed each day\nat various times prior to the\nclose of the NYSE\u2019s regular\ntrading hours. The values of such\ninstruments used in computing a\nFund\u2019s NAV are determined as of\nsuch times. For certain foreign\nassets, a third-party vendor\nsupplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-\nfactor model after the relevant\nforeign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to\ncorrelate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S.\nmarkets following the close of\nthe local markets to the prices\nthat might have prevailed as of a\nFund\u2019s pricing time. Customized\nexchange-traded equity options\nmay be valued using a\nmathematical model that may\nincorporate a number of market\ndata factors. When market\nquotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA\nto be unreliable, BFA will fair\nvalue a Fund\u2019s investments in\naccordance with its policies and\nprocedures. Fair value represents\na good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset or liability.\nIt is the amount that the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to\nreceive from the current sale of\nan asset or the cost to\nextinguish a liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. BFA may\nconclude that a market quotation\nis not readily available or is\nunreliable if: \u25a0 An asset or\nliability does not have a price\nsource due to its lack of trading\nor other reasons; \u25a0 A market\nquotation differs significantly\nfrom recent price quotations or\notherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value; \u25a0 An asset or\nliability is thinly traded; \u25a0\nThere is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent\nmarket quotation; or \u25a0 The\ntrading market on which an\ninstrument is listed is suspended\nor closed and no appropriate\nalternative trading market is\navailable. A \u201c significant event\n\u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable\nbusiness judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, that the\nevent is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last\nexchange closing price or closing\nmarket price of one or more of\nthe Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities.\nValuing a Fund\u2019s investments\nusing fair value pricing may\nresult in prices that differ from\ncurrent market valuations and\nthat may not be the prices at\nwhich those investments could\nhave been sold during the period\nfor which the particular fair\nvalues were used. For an index\nFund, the use of both fair value\nprices and current market\nvaluations in a particular NAV\ncalculation could result in a\ndifference between the prices\nused to calculate a Fund\u2019s NAV\nand the prices used by the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying index. This could, in\nturn, result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of its\nunderlying index. Dividends and\nDistributions General Policies. A\nFund generally declares and pays\ndividends from net investment\nincome, if any, at least once a\nyear. Distributions of net\nrealized securities gains, if\nany, 19 generally are declared\nand paid once a year, but the\nTrust may make distributions on a\nmore frequent basis for a Fund.\nThe Trust reserves the right to\ndeclare special distributions if,\nin its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or\nadvisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company\nor to avoid the imposition of\nincome or excise taxes on\nundistributed income or realized\ngains. Dividends and other\ndistributions on Fund shares are\ndistributed on a pro rata basis\nto beneficial owners of the\nshares. Dividend payments and\nother distributions are made\nthrough DTC participants and\nindirect participants to\nbeneficial owners then of record\nwith proceeds received from the\nFunds. Dividend Reinvestment\nService. No dividend reinvestment\nservice is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make the DTC\nbook-entry Dividend Reinvestment\nProgram available to beneficial\nowners of Fund shares for the\nreinvestment of distributions.\nBeneficial owners should contact\ntheir broker to determine the\navailability and costs of the\nservice and the details of\nparticipation. Brokers may\nrequire beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and\ntimetables. If the program is\nused, dividend distributions of\nboth income and realized gains\nwill be automatically reinvested\nin additional whole Fund shares\npurchased in the secondary\nmarket. Note on Tax Information.\nThe following sections summarize\nsome of the consequences under\ncurrent U.S. federal tax law of\nan investment in a Fund. This\ninformation is not a substitute\nfor personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and\nlocal taxation on Fund\ndistributions and sales of Fund\nshares. Distributions that are\nattributable to interest from\nU.S. federal government\nobligations may be exempt from\ncertain state and local tax.\nConsult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax\nconsequences of an investment in\nFund shares under all applicable\ntax laws. Taxes As with any\ninvestment, you should consider\nhow your investment in shares of\na Fund will be taxed, including\npossible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or when\nyou sell Fund shares. The tax\ninformation in this Prospectus is\nprovided as general information,\nbased on current law. You should\nconsult your own tax professional\nabout the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund.\nThere is no guarantee that shares\nof a Fund will receive certain\nregulatory or accounting\ntreatment. Taxes on Fund\nDistributions Shareholders in a\nFund will receive information\nafter the end of each calendar\nyear setting forth the amount of\ndividends and long-term capital\ngains distributed to them by the\nFund during the prior year, if\nany. Likewise, the amount of tax-\nexempt income, if any, that a\nFund distributes will be\nreported. Such income must be\nreported on the shareholder\u2019s\nU.S. federal income tax return.\nIn general, distributions are\nsubject to U.S. federal income\ntax for the year when they are\npaid. Certain distributions paid\nin January, however, may be\ntreated as paid on December 31 of\nthe prior year. Capital Gains.\nDistributions from a Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than\nqualified dividend income or from\nnet tax-exempt income, if any),\nincluding distributions of 20\nincome from securities lending\nand distributions out of a Fund\u2019s\nnet short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as\nordinary income. Distributions by\na Fund of net long-term capital\ngains, if any, in excess of net\nshort-term capital losses\n(capital gain dividends) are\ntaxable to you as long-term\ncapital gains, regardless of how\nlong you have held the Fund\u2019s\nshares. Long-term capital gains\nand qualified dividend income are\ngenerally eligible for taxation\nat preferential rates for non-\ncorporate shareholders. However,\ndifferent preferential rates may\napply depending on the type of\ncapital gains, such as Fund\ndistributions of certain amounts\nreceived from real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ),\nif any. Return of Capital. If a\nFund\u2019s distributions exceed\ncurrent and accumulated earnings\nand profits, all or a portion of\nthe distributions made in the\ntaxable year may be\nrecharacterized as a return of\ncapital to shareholders. A return\nof capital distribution generally\nwill not be taxable but will\nreduce the shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis and result in a higher\ncapital gain or lower capital\nloss when those shares on which\nthe distribution was received are\nsold. Once a shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis is reduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as\ncapital gains, if the shareholder\nholds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets. Distributions in\nexcess of a Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but\nnot in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will\nnot constitute nontaxable returns\nof capital. Qualified Dividend\nIncome. Distributions by a Fund\nthat qualify as qualified\ndividend income, if any, are\ntaxable to you at long-term\ncapital gain rates. Dividends\nwill be qualified dividend income\nto you if they are attributable\nto qualified dividend income\nreceived by a Fund. Generally,\nqualified dividend income\nincludes dividend income from\nstock issued by taxable U.S.\ncorporations and qualified\nnon-U.S. corporations, provided\nthat the Fund satisfies certain\nholding period requirements and\nhas not hedged its position in\nthe stock in certain ways. For\nthis purpose, a qualified\nnon-U.S. corporation means any\nnon-U.S. corporation that is\neligible for benefits under a\ncomprehensive income tax treaty\nwith the U.S., which includes an\nexchange of information program,\nor if the stock with respect to\nwhich the dividend was paid is\nreadily tradable on an\nestablished U.S. securities\nmarket. The term excludes a\ncorporation that is a passive\nforeign investment company.\nDividends received by a Fund from\na RIC, if any, generally are\nqualified dividend income only to\nthe extent that such dividend\ndistributions are made out of\nqualified dividend income\nreceived by such RIC.\nAdditionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from\na REIT, if any, and distributed\nto a shareholder generally will\nbe taxable to the shareholder as\nordinary income. However, for tax\nyears beginning after December\n31, 2017 and before January 1,\n2026, a Fund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified\nbusiness income \u201d deduction for\nnon-corporate U.S. shareholders\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s\nincome is derived from ordinary\nREIT dividends, reduced by\nallocable Fund expenses. For a\ndividend to be treated as\nqualified dividend income, the\ndividend must be received with\nrespect to a share of stock held\nwithout being hedged by the\nrelevant Fund, and with respect\nto a share of the Fund held\nwithout being hedged by you, for\n61 days during the 121-day period\nbeginning at the date that is 60\ndays before the date 21 on which\nsuch share becomes ex-dividend\nwith respect to such dividend or,\nin the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day\nperiod beginning 90 days before\nsuch date. Fund distributions, to\nthe extent attributable to\ndividends from U.S. corporations,\nwill be eligible for the\ndividends received deduction for\nFund shareholders that are\ncorporations, subject to certain\nhedging and holding requirements.\nSubstitute dividends received by\na Fund with respect to dividends\npaid on securities lent out, if\nany, will not be qualified\ndividend income. Medicare Tax. A\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on \u201c\nnet investment income, \u201d\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net\ngain, of U.S. individuals with\nincome exceeding $200,000 (or\n$250,000 if married and filing\njointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Alternative Minimum Tax.\nThe AMT is a separate U.S.\nfederal tax system that operates\nin parallel to the regular\nfederal income tax system but\neliminates many deductions and\nexclusions. The AMT has different\ntax rates and treats as taxable\ncertain types of income that are\nnontaxable for regular income tax\npurposes, such as the interest on\ncertain \u201c private activity \u201d\nmunicipal bonds. If a taxpayer\u2019s\noverall AMT liability is higher\nthan regular income tax\nliability, then the taxpayer owes\nthe regular income tax liability\nplus the difference between the\nAMT liability and the regular\nincome tax liability. Original\nIssue Discount and Inflation-\nRelated Adjustments Accruals of \u201c\noriginal issue discount \u201d on\nbonds that a Fund acquires at a\ndiscount and adjustments for\ninflation to the principal amount\nof an inflation-protected U.S.\nTreasury bond held by a Fund may\nbe included for tax purposes in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income, even\nthough no cash attributable to\nsuch gross income has at that\npoint been received by the Fund.\nIn such event, the Fund may be\nrequired to make annual\ndistributions to shareholders\nthat exceed the cash it has\notherwise received. In order to\npay such distributions, the Fund\nmay be required to raise cash by\nselling portfolio investments.\nThe sale of such investments\ncould result in capital gains to\nthe Fund and additional capital\ngains distributions to Fund\nshareholders. In addition, any\ndeflation-related adjustments\nduring the taxable year to an\ninflation-indexed bond held by a\nFund may cause amounts\ndistributed in the taxable year\nas income to be characterized as\na return of capital. Market\nDiscount Bonds Any market\ndiscount recognized on a bond,\nincluding a tax-exempt interest\nbond, is taxable as ordinary\nincome. A market discount bond is\na bond acquired in the secondary\nmarket at a price below\nredemption value or adjusted\nissue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount. To the\nextent that a Fund does not\ninclude the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gains on\nthe Fund\u2019s disposition of such an\nobligation will be treated as\nordinary income rather than\ncapital gains to the extent of\nthe accrued market discount. 22\nDerivatives and Other Complex\nInstruments A Fund may invest in\nderivatives and other complex\ninstruments, and such investments\nmay be subject to special and\ncomplicated rules. These rules\ncould affect whether gains and\nlosses recognized by a Fund are\ntreated as ordinary income or\ncapital gains, accelerate the\nrecognition of income to a Fund\nor defer a Fund\u2019s ability to\nrecognize losses. In addition,\nthese rules may affect the\namount, timing or character of\nincome distributed to you by a\nFund. You should consult your\npersonal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules.\nNon-U.S. Income Taxes Dividends,\ninterest and capital gains (if\nany) earned by a Fund with\nrespect to securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers may give rise to\nwithholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S.\ncountries. Tax conventions\nbetween certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If, at the close of a\nyear, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s\ntotal assets consist of non-U.S.\nstocks or securities (generally,\nfor this purpose, depositary\nreceipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated\nas \u201c non-U.S. \u201d ), generally the\nFund may \u201c pass through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes,\nincluding withholding taxes, paid\nby the Fund. This means that you\nwould be considered to have\nreceived as an additional\ndividend your share of such\nnon-U.S. taxes, but you may be\nentitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in\ncalculating your taxable income\nor, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in\ncalculating your U.S. federal\nincome tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to\nindividuals in computing their\nalternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not\npass through non-U.S. taxes, the\nFund will be entitled to claim a\ndeduction for certain foreign\ntaxes that it incurs. Under\ncertain circumstances, if a Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign\ntaxes paid with respect to a\nprior year, the value of Fund\nshares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions\npassed through to shareholders\nwith respect to the Fund\u2019s\nforeign taxes for the current\nyear could be reduced. If, at the\nclose of the year, more than 50%\nof a Fund\u2019s total assets consist\nof stocks or securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers, including\ndepositary receipts (no matter\nwhere traded) of non-U.S.\ncompanies, or, at the close of\neach quarter, more than 50% of a\nFund\u2019s total assets consist of\nshares of an Underlying Fund, the\nFund may \u201c pass-through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes\n(including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund or, if its\nassets meet these requirements,\nthe Underlying Fund. For purposes\nof foreign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of a Fund, foreign\ncapital gains taxes may not\nproduce associated foreign source\nincome, limiting the availability\nof such credits for U.S. persons.\nNon-U.S. Shareholders If you are\nneither a resident nor a citizen\nof the U.S. or if you are a\nnon-U.S. entity (other than a\npass-through entity to the extent\nowned by U.S. persons), a Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends, if\nany, generally will be subject to\na 30% U.S. federal withholding\ntax, unless a lower treaty rate\napplies. However, withholding tax\ngenerally will not apply to any\ngain or income realized by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder upon the\nsale or 23 other disposition of\nFund shares or with respect to\ncertain distributions paid to a\nnon-U.S. shareholder and reported\nby the Fund as capital gain\ndividends, interest-related\ndividends or short-term capital\ngain dividends. Separately, a 30%\nwithholding tax may be imposed on\nFund distributions (if any) paid\nto certain foreign entities,\nunless such entities comply, or\nare deemed compliant, with\nextensive reporting and\nwithholding requirements designed\nto inform the U.S. Department of\nthe Treasury of U.S.-owned\nforeign investment accounts.\nBackup Withholding If you are a\nresident or a citizen of the U.S.\nand you have not provided a\ntaxpayer identification number or\nsocial security number and made\nother required certifications, by\nlaw, backup withholding at a 24%\nrate will apply to Fund\ndistributions and proceeds (if\nany). Securities Lending If your\nshares of a Fund are loaned out\npursuant to a securities lending\narrangement, you may lose the\nability to treat Fund dividends\nthat are paid while the shares\nare held by the borrower as\nqualified dividend income, and\nyou may lose the ability to use\nnon-U.S. tax credits passed\nthrough by the Fund. Fund of\nFunds If a Fund invests in an\nUnderlying Fund, short-term\ncapital gains earned by the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will be\nordinary income when distributed\nto the Fund and will not be\noffset by the Fund\u2019s capital\nlosses. To the extent such Fund\nis expected to invest in an\nUnderlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s\nrealized losses on sales of\nshares of the Underlying Fund may\nbe indefinitely or permanently\ndeferred as \u201c wash sales. \u201d\nCapital loss carryforwards of the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will not\noffset net capital gains of the\nFund. Taxes on the Sale of\nExchange-Listed Fund Shares Any\ncapital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund shares is\ngenerally treated as a long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the\nshares have been held for more\nthan one year. Any capital gain\nor loss realized upon a sale of\nFund shares that have been held\nfor one year or less is generally\ntreated as a short-term capital\ngain or loss. However, any\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nshares held for six months or\nless is treated as a long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that\ncapital gain dividends were paid\nwith respect to such shares. Any\nsuch capital gains, including\nfrom sales of Fund shares or from\ncapital gain dividends, are\nincluded in \u201c net investment\nincome \u201d for purposes of the 3.8%\nU.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions Prior\nto being traded in the secondary\nmarket, Fund shares are \u201c created\n\u201d at NAV by Authorized\nParticipants ( i.e. , market\nmakers, large investors and other\nfinancial institutions) in block-\nsize Creation Units or multiples\nthereof. Fund shares are created\nor redeemed only in Creation\nUnits, and only Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem\nCreation Units with the Funds. 24\n\nEach Authorized Participant is a\nmember or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with\nthe SEC and has entered into a\nwritten agreement with the Funds\u2019\nDistributor, an affiliate of BFA.\nThe agreement allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place\norders for the purchase and\nredemption of Creation Units.\nAuthorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units\nfor their own accounts or for\ncustomers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of the\nFunds. Creation transactions are\nsubject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the relevant\nFund. Generally, there are three\ntransaction methods for creating\nand redeeming Fund shares: in-\nkind securities ( \u201c in-kind \u201d ),\npartial cash and all cash. In-\nKind . In a creation transaction,\nan Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund a \u201c creation\nbasket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets\ndesignated by the Fund, as well\nas a cash amount. The Authorized\nParticipant receives a specified\nnumber of Creation Units in\nreturn. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation\nUnits with a Fund and receives\nfrom the Fund a \u201c redemption\nbasket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets\ndesignated by the Fund, as well\nas a cash amount. Partial Cash .\nIn a creation transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits\ninto a Fund a creation basket and\na cash amount, including cash\nthat replaces a security or other\nasset in the creation basket, in\nexchange for Creation Units. In a\nredemption transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits\nCreation Units with a Fund and\nreceives from the Fund a\nredemption basket and a cash\namount, including cash that\nreplaces a security or other\nasset in the redemption basket.\nAll Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits into a Fund\nan amount of cash specified by\nthe Fund in exchange for Creation\nUnits. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation\nUnits with a Fund and receives\nfrom the Fund a specified amount\nof cash. The creation and\nredemption baskets for a Fund may\ndiffer in composition, and\ncertain iShares ETFs accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d More\ninformation about custom baskets\nis provided in the Funds\u2019 SAI.\nEach Fund generally engages in\ncreation and redemption\ntransactions according to the\nmethod indicated in the table\nbelow. In certain circumstances,\nhowever, a Fund may use another\ntransaction method ( e.g. , an\nin-kind Fund may transact\npartially or fully in cash).\n                                              \n  Fund        In-Kind  Partial      All Cash  \n                       Cash                   \n  iShares                                     \n  iBonds Dec                                  \n  2055        \u2713                               \n  TermTreas\u2026                                  \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nThe prices at which creations\nand redemptions occur are based\non the next calculation of a\nFund\u2019s NAV after a creation or\nredemption order is tendered in\nan acceptable form under the\nAuthorized Participant\nagreement. In the event of a\nsystem failure or other\ninterruption, including\ndisruptions at market makers or\nAuthorized Participants,\ncreation and redemption orders\nmay not be executed according\nto a Fund\u2019s instructions or may\nnot be executed at all.\n\n25\n\nAdditional information about\nthe creation and redemption of\nCreation Units (including the\ncut-off times for the receipt\nof creation and redemption\norders) is included in the\nFunds\u2019 SAI. The Funds do not\nimpose restrictions on the\nfrequency of purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with a Fund. The Board\ndetermined not to adopt\npolicies and procedures\ndesigned to prevent or monitor\nfor frequent purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares\nbecause each Fund generally\nsells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions\nthat are in-kind and/or for\ncash, with a deadline for\nplacing cash-related\ntransactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets\nfor the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities. However, the Funds\nhave taken certain measures (\ne.g. , imposing transaction\nfees on purchases and\nredemptions of Creation Units\nand reserving the right to\nreject purchases of Creation\nUnits under certain\ncircumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of\nfrequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased\ntracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution\nto the Funds, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the\nvast majority of trading in\nFund shares occurs on the\nsecondary market, which does\nnot involve the Funds directly,\nand such trading is unlikely to\ncause many of the harmful\neffects of frequent cash\npurchases or redemptions of\nFund shares. To the extent a\nFund engages in in-kind\ntransactions, the Fund intends\nto comply with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws in accepting\nsecurities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with\nredemption securities by, among\nother means, assuring that any\nsecurities accepted for deposit\nand any securities used to\nsatisfy redemption requests\nwill be sold in transactions\nthat would be exempt from\nregistration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as\namended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ).\nFurther, an Authorized\nParticipant that is not a \u201c\nqualified institutional buyer,\n\u201d as such term is defined in\nRule 144A under the 1933 Act,\nwill not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible\nfor resale under Rule 144A.\nBecause Fund shares may be\ncreated and issued on an\nongoing basis, at any point\nduring the life of a Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is\nused in the 1933 Act, may be\noccurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their\npart may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their\nbeing deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that\ncould render them statutory\nunderwriters subject to the\nprospectus delivery and\nliability provisions of the\n1933 Act. Any determination of\nwhether one is an underwriter\nmust take into account all the\nrelevant facts and\ncircumstances of each\nparticular case. Broker-dealers\nshould also note that dealers\nwho are not \u201c underwriters \u201d\nbut are participating in a\ndistribution (as contrasted to\nordinary secondary\ntransactions), and thus dealing\nwith shares that are part of an\n\u201c unsold allotment \u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C)\nof the 1933 Act, would be\nunable to take advantage of the\nprospectus delivery exemption\nprovided by Section 4(a)(3) of\nthe 1933 Act. For delivery of\nprospectuses to exchange\nmembers, the prospectus\ndelivery mechanism of Rule 153\nunder the 1933 Act is available\nonly with respect to\ntransactions on a national\nsecurities exchange.\nHouseholding 26 Householding is\nan option available to certain\nFund investors. Householding is\na method of delivery, based on\nthe preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a\nsingle copy of certain\nshareholder documents can be\ndelivered to investors who\nshare the same address, even if\ntheir accounts are registered\nunder different names. Please\ncontact your broker-dealer if\nyou are interested in enrolling\nin householding and receiving a\nsingle copy of prospectuses and\nother shareholder documents, or\nif you are currently enrolled\nin householding and wish to\nchange your householding\nstatus. Distribution The\nDistributor or its agent\ndistributes Creation Units for\nthe Funds on an agency basis.\nThe Distributor does not\nmaintain a secondary market in\nshares of the Funds. The\nDistributor has no role in\ndetermining the policies of the\nFunds or the securities or\nother assets (as applicable)\nthat are purchased or sold by\nthe Funds. The Distributor\u2019s\nprincipal address is 50 Hudson\nYards, New York, NY 10001. BFA\nor its affiliates make payments\nto broker-dealers, registered\ninvestment advisers, banks or\nother intermediaries (together,\n\u201c intermediaries \u201d ) related to\nmarketing activities and\npresentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology\nplatforms and reporting\nsystems, data provision\nservices, or their making\nshares of the Funds available\nto their customers generally\nand in certain investment\nprograms. Such payments, which\nmay be significant to the\nintermediary, are not made by\nthe Funds. Rather, such\npayments are made by BFA or its\naffiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly\nor indirectly in part from fees\npaid by the Funds. Payments of\nthis type are sometimes\nreferred to as revenue-sharing\npayments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options\nit recommends or makes\navailable, or the level of\nservices provided, to its\ncustomers based on the payments\nor other financial incentives\nthe intermediary is eligible to\nreceive. Therefore, such\npayments or other financial\nincentives that are offered or\nmade to an intermediary create\nconflicts of interest between\nthe intermediary and its\ncustomers and may cause the\nintermediary to recommend the\nFunds over another investment.\nMore information regarding\nthese payments is contained in\nthe applicable SAI. Please\ncontact your salesperson or\nother investment professional\nfor more information regarding\nany such payments that their\nfirm may receive from BFA or\nits affiliates.

or portfolios. The Trust was\norganized as a Delaware statutory trust on\nDecember 16, 1999 and is authorized to have\nmultiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 Act.\nThe offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ). This SAI\nrelates solely to the Fund. The Fund is\nmanaged by BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d\n), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of\nBlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track\nthe investment results of the specific\nbenchmark index identified in the Fund's\nProspectus (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ). The\nFund is a term fund that will terminate on or\nabout December 15, 2055, at which time it will\ndistribute its remaining net assets to\nshareholders pursuant to a plan of\nliquidation. The Fund offers and issues shares\nat their net asset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d )\nonly in aggregations of a specified number of\nshares (each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ), generally\nin exchange for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other positions\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) included in its\nUnderlying Index (the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d\nor \u201c Creation Basket \u201d ), together with the\ndeposit of a specified cash payment (the \u201c\nCash Component \u201d ). Shares of the Fund are\nlisted for trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market\n( \u201c Nasdaq \u201d or the \u201c Listing Exchange \u201d ), a\nnational securities exchange. Shares of the\nFund are traded in the secondary market and\nelsewhere at market prices that may be at,\nabove or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are\nredeemable only in Creation Units, and,\ngenerally, in exchange for portfolio\nsecurities and a Cash Amount (as defined in\nthe Creation and Redemption of Creation Units-\nRole of the Authorized Participant section of\nthis SAI). Creation Units typically are a\nspecified number of shares, generally 50,000\nor multiples thereof. The Trust reserves the\nright to permit or require that creations and\nredemptions of shares are effected fully or\npartially in cash and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of cash. Shares may be\nissued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities, subject to various conditions,\nincluding a requirement that the Authorized\nParticipant maintain collateral with the Trust\nas set forth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to purchase Deposit\nSecurities. See the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI.\nTransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith creations or redemptions that include a\ncash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin the Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of the Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe Prospectus. Shares of the Fund are listed\nfor trading, and trade throughout the day, on\nthe Listing Exchange and in other secondary\nmarkets. Shares of the Fund may also be listed\non certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no\nassurance that the requirements of the Listing\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nshares of the Fund will continue to be met.\nThe Listing Exchange may, but is not required\nto, remove the shares of the Fund from listing\nif, among other things: (i) following the\ninitial 12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of the Fund; (ii) the Fund is\nno longer eligible to operate in reliance on\nRule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act;\n(iii) any of the other listing requirements\nare not continuously maintained; or (iv) any\nevent shall occur or condition shall exist\nthat, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of the Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission determined by that broker, as well\nas other charges.\n\n1\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nshare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund. Investment\nStrategies and Risks The Fund seeks to achieve\nits objective by investing primarily in both\nfixed-income securities that compose its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that\nprovide substantially similar exposure to\nsecurities in its Underlying Index. The Fund\noperates as an index fund and is not actively\nmanaged. Adverse performance of a security in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio will ordinarily not\nresult in the elimination of the security from\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio. The Fund engages in\nrepresentative sampling, which is investing in\na sample of securities selected by BFA to have\na collective investment profile similar to\nthat of the Fund's Underlying Index.\nSecurities selected have aggregate investment\ncharacteristics (based on market value and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as yield, credit rating,\nmaturity and duration) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of the Fund\u2019s Underlying\nIndex. A fund that uses representative\nsampling generally does not hold all of the\nsecurities that are in its underlying index.\nAlthough the Fund does not seek leveraged\nreturns, certain instruments used by the Fund\nmay have a leveraging effect as described\nbelow. The Fund will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component securities of the\nUnderlying Index, and the Fund will invest at\nleast 90% of its assets in U.S. Treasury\nsecurities that BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index, in each case\nexcept as described below. The Fund will\ninvest no more than 10% of its assets in\nfutures, options and swaps contracts that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part of that\nposition for the purposes of calculating the\npercentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. In the\nlast six months of operation, as the bonds\nheld by the Fund mature, the proceeds will\ntypically be reinvested by the Fund in\ninvestments already in the Underlying Index\nbut may also be invested in other cash and\ncash equivalents as determined by BFA. To the\nextent that the Fund invests in money market\nor similar funds, it will incur the fees and\nexpenses of such funds. By December 15 of the\nrelevant year, the Fund is expected to consist\nalmost entirely of cash. On or around this\ndate, the Fund will wind up and terminate.\nAfter appropriate provision is made for any\nFund liabilities, its net assets will be\ndistributed to then-current shareholders\npursuant to a plan of liquidation. The Fund's\ntermination was approved by a majority of the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d ) and\ndoes not require additional approval by Fund\nshareholders. The Board may extend the\ntermination date if a majority of the Board\ndetermines the extension to be in the best\ninterest of the Fund. The Fund should not be\nconfused with a target date fund, which has\nassets that are managed according to a\nparticular investment strategy that converts\nfund assets to conservative investments over\ntime. Bonds. The Fund invests a substantial\nportion of its assets in U.S. dollar-\ndenominated bonds. A bond is an interest-\nbearing security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S.\ncompany or governmental unit. The issuer of a\nbond has a contractual obligation to pay\ninterest at a stated rate on specific dates\nand to repay principal (the bond\u2019s face value)\nperiodically or on a specified maturity date.\nBonds generally are used by issuers to borrow\nmoney from investors. An issuer may have the\nright to redeem or \u201c call \u201d a bond before\nmaturity, in which case the Fund may have to\nreinvest the proceeds at lower market rates.\nSimilarly, the Fund may have to reinvest\ninterest income or payments received when\nbonds mature, sometimes at lower market rates.\nMost bonds bear interest income at a \u201c coupon\n\u201d rate that is fixed for the life of the bond.\nThe value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises\nwhen market interest rates fall, and falls\nwhen market interest rates rise. Accordingly,\na fixed-rate bond\u2019s yield (income as a percent\nof the bond\u2019s current value) may differ from\nits coupon rate as its value rises or falls.\nWhen an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond\nat a price that is greater than its face\nvalue, the investor is purchasing the bond at\na premium. Conversely, when an investor\npurchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is\nless than its face value, the investor is\npurchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate\nbonds that are purchased at a discount pay\nless current income than securities with\ncomparable yields that are purchased at face\nvalue, with the result that prices for such\nfixed-rate securities can be more volatile\nthan prices for such securities that are\npurchased at face value. Other types of\n\n2\n\nbonds bear interest at an interest rate that\nis adjusted periodically. Interest rates on \u201c\nfloating rate \u201d or \u201c variable rate \u201d bonds may\nbe higher or lower than current market rates\nfor fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality\nwith similar final maturities. Because of\ntheir adjustable interest rates, the value of\n\u201c floating rate \u201d or \u201c variable rate \u201d bonds\nfluctuates much less in response to market\ninterest rate movements than the value of\nfixed-rate bonds, but their value may decline\nif their interest rates do not rise as much,\nor as quickly, as interest rates in general.\nThe Fund may treat some of these bonds as\nhaving a shorter maturity for purposes of\ncalculating the weighted average maturity of\nits investment portfolio. Generally, prices of\nhigher quality issues tend to fluctuate less\nwith changes in market interest rates than\nprices of lower quality issues and prices of\nlonger maturity issues tend to fluctuate more\nthan prices of shorter maturity issues. Bonds\nmay be senior or subordinated obligations.\nSenior obligations generally have the first\nclaim on an issuer\u2019s earnings and assets and,\nin the event of liquidation, are paid before\nsubordinated obligations. Bonds may be\nunsecured (backed only by the issuer\u2019s general\ncreditworthiness) or secured (backed by\nspecified collateral). Borrowing. The Fund may\nborrow for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The purchase\nof securities while borrowings are outstanding\nmay have the effect of leveraging the Fund.\nThe incurrence of leverage increases the\nFund\u2019s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds\nare subject to interest costs that will reduce\nnet income. Purchasing securities while\nborrowings are outstanding creates special\nrisks, such as the potential for greater\nvolatility in the NAV of Fund shares and in\nthe yield on the Fund\u2019s portfolio. In\naddition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the\namount available (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\nthe Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by the Fund must be made from a\nbank or may result in the Fund being subject\nto covenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire the Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Diversification\nStatus. The Fund is classified as a\ndiversified fund under the 1940 Act. This\nmeans that the Fund may not purchase\nsecurities of an issuer (other than (i)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\nand (ii) securities of other investment\ncompanies) if, with respect to 75% of its\ntotal assets, (a) more than 5% of the Fund\u2019s\ntotal assets would be invested in securities\nof that issuer or (b) the Fund would hold more\nthan 10% of the outstanding voting securities\nof that issuer. With respect to the remaining\n25% of its total assets, the Fund may invest\nmore than 5% of its assets in one issuer.\nUnder the 1940 Act, the Fund cannot change its\nclassification from diversified to non-\ndiversified without shareholder approval. The\nFund intends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S.\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective. Futures, Options on Futures and\nSecurities Options. Futures contracts, options\non futures and securities options may be used\nby the Fund to simulate investment in its\nUnderlying Index, to facilitate trading or to\nreduce transaction costs. The Fund may enter\ninto futures contracts and options on futures\nthat are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures\nexchange. The Fund will not use futures,\noptions on futures or securities options for\nspeculative purposes. The Fund intends to use\nfutures and options on futures in accordance\nwith Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under\nthe Commodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA,\nwith respect to the Fund, has claimed an\nexclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d in accordance with\nRule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to the\nFund, is not subject to registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under\nthe CEA. See the Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives section of this SAI for more\ninformation. Futures contracts provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\n\n3\n\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. The\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, the Fund\nwill be required to deposit with the broker an\namount of cash or cash equivalents known as \u201c\ninitial margin, \u201d which is similar to a\nperformance bond or good faith deposit on the\ncontract and is returned to the Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, the Fund may elect to close the\nposition by taking an opposite position, which\nwill operate to terminate the Fund\u2019s existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof the Fund. The potential for loss related to\nwriting call options is unlimited. The\npotential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. The Fund may purchase and write put and\ncall options on futures contracts that are\ntraded on an exchange as a hedge against\nchanges in value of its portfolio securities\nor in anticipation of the purchase of\nsecurities, and may enter into closing\ntransactions with respect to such options to\nterminate existing positions. There is no\nguarantee that such closing transactions can\nbe effected. Securities options may be used by\nthe Fund to obtain access to securities in the\nUnderlying Index or to dispose of securities\nin the Underlying Index at favorable prices,\nto invest cash in a securities index that\noffers similar exposure to that provided by\nthe Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve\nthe Fund\u2019s objective of tracking the\nUnderlying Index. A call option gives a holder\nthe right to purchase a specific security at a\nspecified price ( \u201c exercise price \u201d ) within\na specified period of time. A put option gives\na holder the right to sell a specific security\nat an exercise price within a specified period\nof time. The initial purchaser of a call\noption pays the \u201c writer \u201d a premium, which is\npaid at the time of purchase and is retained\nby the writer whether or not such option is\nexercised. The Fund may purchase put options\nto hedge its portfolio against the risk of a\ndecline in the market value of securities held\nand may purchase call options to hedge against\nan increase in the price of securities it is\ncommitted to purchase. The Fund may write put\nand call options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. The Fund may purchase or sell\nsecurities options on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nsecurities exchange or in the over-the-counter\n( \u201c OTC \u201d ) market through a transaction with\na dealer. Options on a securities index are\ntypically settled on a net basis based on the\nappreciation or depreciation of the index\nlevel over the strike price. Options on single\nname securities may be cash- or physically-\nsettled, depending upon the market in which\nthey are traded. Options may be structured so\nas to be exercisable only on certain dates or\non a daily basis. Options may also be\nstructured to have conditions to exercise (\ni.e. , \u201c Knock-in Events \u201d ) or conditions\nthat trigger termination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out\nEvents \u201d ). Lending Portfolio Securities. The\nFund may lend portfolio securities to certain\nborrowers that BFA determines to be\ncreditworthy, including borrowers affiliated\nwith BFA. The borrowers provide collateral\nthat is maintained in an amount at least equal\nto the current market value of the securities\nloaned. No securities loan shall be made on\nbehalf of the Fund if, as a result, the\naggregate value of all securities loans of the\nFund exceeds one-third of the value of the\nFund's total assets (including the value of\nthe collateral received). The Fund may\nterminate a loan at any time and obtain the\nreturn of the securities loaned. The Fund\nreceives, by way of substitute payment, the\nvalue of any interest or cash or non-cash\ndistributions paid on the loaned securities\nthat it would have otherwise received if the\nsecurities were not on loan. With respect to\nloans that are collateralized by cash, the\nborrower may be entitled to receive a fee\nbased on the amount of cash collateral. The\nFund is compensated by any positive difference\nbetween the amount earned on the reinvestment\nof cash collateral and the fee paid to the\nborrower. In the case of collateral other than\ncash, the Fund is compensated by a fee paid by\nthe borrower equal to a percentage of the\nmarket value of the loaned securities. Any\ncash collateral received by the Fund for\n\n4\n\nsuch loans, and uninvested cash, may be\nreinvested in certain short-term instruments\neither directly on behalf of the Fund or\nthrough one or more joint accounts or money\nmarket funds, including those affiliated with\nBFA; such investments are subject to\ninvestment risk. The Fund conducts its\nsecurities lending pursuant to an exemptive\norder from the SEC permitting it to lend\nportfolio securities to borrowers affiliated\nwith the Fund and to retain an affiliate of\nthe Fund to act as securities lending agent.\nTo the extent that the Fund engages in\nsecurities lending, BlackRock Institutional\nTrust Company, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d ) acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund, subject\nto the overall supervision of BFA. BTC\nadministers the lending program in accordance\nwith guidelines approved by the Trust's Board\nof Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the trustees of\nwhich are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ). Securities\nlending involves exposure to certain risks,\nincluding operational risk (i.e., the risk of\nlosses resulting from problems in the\nsettlement and accounting process), \u201c gap \u201d\nrisk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the\nreturn on cash collateral reinvestments and\nthe fees the Fund has agreed to pay a\nborrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the\nrisk of a shortfall at default when a cash\ncollateral investment is denominated in a\ncurrency other than the currency of the assets\nbeing loaned due to movements in foreign\nexchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If the Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, the Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return the Fund\u2019s securities as agreed,\nthe Fund\u2019s ability to participate in a\ncorporate action event may be impacted, or the\nFund may experience losses if the proceeds\nreceived from liquidating the collateral do\nnot at least equal the value of the loaned\nsecurity at the time the collateral is\nliquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nThis latter event could trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. The Fund could lose\nmoney if its short-term investment of the\ncollateral declines in value over the period\nof the loan. Substitute payments received by\nthe Fund representing dividends paid on\nsecurities loaned out by the Fund will not be\nconsidered qualified dividend income. BTC will\ntake into account the tax effects on\nshareholders caused by this difference in\nconnection with the Fund\u2019s securities lending\nprogram. Substitute payments received on tax-\nexempt securities loaned out will not be tax-\nexempt income. There could also be changes in\nthe status of issuers under applicable laws\nand regulations, including tax regulations,\nthat may impact the regulatory or tax\ntreatment of loaned securities and could, for\nexample, result in a delay in the payment of\ndividend equivalent payments owed to the Fund\n(as permitted by applicable law). Regulations\nadopted by global prudential regulators\nrequire certain bank-regulated counterparties\nand certain of their affiliates to include in\ncertain financial contracts, including many\nsecurities lending agreements, terms that\ndelay or restrict the rights of\ncounterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate\nsuch agreements, foreclose upon collateral,\nexercise other default rights or restrict\ntransfers of credit support in the event that\nthe counterparty and/or its affiliates are\nsubject to certain types of resolution or\ninsolvency proceedings. It is possible that\nthese requirements, as well as potential\nadditional government regulation and other\ndevelopments in the market, could adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s ability to terminate\nexisting securities lending agreements or to\nrealize amounts to be received under such\nagreements. Prudential regulation may also\nfavor lenders that can provide additional\nprotections, such as liens that are\nexercisable in connection with a lender\ndefault, to borrowers. The Fund may provide\nadditional protections to borrowers, where\npermitted pursuant to the Fund\u2019s investment\npolicies and if BFA believes doing so is in\nthe best interest of the Fund. Liquidity Risk\nManagement. Rule 22e-4 under the Investment\nCompany Act (the \u201c Liquidity Rule \u201d ) requires\nopen-end funds, including exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) such as the Fund, to\nestablish a liquidity risk management program\n(the \u201c Liquidity Program \u201d ) and enhance\ndisclosures regarding fund liquidity. As\nrequired by the Liquidity Rule, the Fund has\nimplemented a Liquidity Program, and the\nBoard, including a majority of the Independent\nTrustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as\nthe administrator of the Liquidity Program.\nUnder the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses,\nmanages, and periodically reviews the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk and classifies each investment\nheld by the Fund as a \u201c highly liquid\ninvestment, \u201d \u201c moderately liquid investment,\n\u201d \u201c less liquid investment \u201d or \u201c illiquid\ninvestment. \u201d The Liquidity Rule defines \u201c\nliquidity risk \u201d as the risk that the Fund\ncould not meet requests to redeem shares\nissued by the Fund without significant\ndilution of the remaining investors\u2019 interest\nin the Fund. The liquidity of the Fund's\nportfolio investments is determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and\n\n5\n\ninvestment-specific considerations under the\nLiquidity Program. There are exclusions from\ncertain portions of the liquidity risk\nmanagement program requirements for \u201c in-kind\n\u201d ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To\nthe extent that an investment is deemed to be\nan illiquid investment or a less liquid\ninvestment, the Fund can expect to be exposed\nto greater liquidity risk. Ratings. An\ninvestment-grade rating generally means the\nsecurity or issuer is rated investment-grade\nby one or more of Moody\u2019s Investors Service,\nInc. ( \u201c Moody's \u201d ), S&P Global Ratings,\nFitch Ratings, Inc. ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ), or another\ncredit rating agency designated as a\nnationally recognized statistical rating\norganization ( \u201c NRSRO \u201d ) by the SEC, or is\nunrated but considered to be of equivalent\nquality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated Baa3 or\nabove by Moody\u2019s or BBB- or above by S&P\nGlobal Ratings and Fitch are considered \u201c\ninvestment-grade \u201d securities, bonds rated Baa\nare considered medium grade obligations\nsubject to moderate credit risk and may\npossess certain speculative characteristics,\nwhile bonds rated BBB are regarded as having\nadequate capacity to meet financial\ncommitments. Subsequent to purchase by the\nFund, a rated security may cease to be rated\nor its rating may be reduced below an\ninvestment-grade rating. Bonds rated below\nBaa3 by Moody\u2019s or below BBB- by S&P Global\nRatings or Fitch are generally considered\nbelow investment-grade quality and are\nobligations of issuers that are generally\nconsidered predominantly speculative with\nrespect to the issuer\u2019s capacity to pay\ninterest and repay principal according to the\nterms of the obligation and, therefore, carry\ngreater investment risk, including the\npossibility of issuer default and bankruptcy\nand increased market price volatility. Such\nlower-rated securities are commonly referred\nto as \u201c junk bonds \u201d and are subject to a\nsubstantial degree of credit risk. Please see\nAppendix B of this SAI for a description of\neach rating category of Moody's, S&P Global\nRatings and Fitch and BFA's treatment of\ninvestments that are not rated by any of the\nrating agencies. Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives. The Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission ( \u201c CFTC \u201d ) subjects advisers to\nregistered investment companies to regulation\nby the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the\nadviser either (i) invests, directly or\nindirectly, more than a prescribed level of\nits liquidation value in CFTC-regulated\nfutures, options and swaps ( \u201c CFTC\nDerivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent the Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCommodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ) pursuant to\nRule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to the\nFund. BFA is not, therefore, subject to\nregistration or regulation as a \u201c commodity\npool operator \u201d under the CEA with respect to\nthe Fund. Derivative contracts, including,\nwithout limitation, swaps, currency forwards,\nand non-deliverable forwards, are subject to\nregulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act ( \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under comparable\nregimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.\njurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards\nand certain other derivatives traded in the\nover-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) market are\nsubject to variation margin and initial margin\nrequirements. Implementation of the margining\nand other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act\nregarding clearing, mandatory trading,\nreporting and documentation of swaps and other\nderivatives have impacted and may continue to\nimpact the costs to the Fund of trading these\ninstruments and, as a result, may affect\nreturns to investors in the Fund. Rule 18f-4\nunder the Investment Company Act permits the\nFund to enter into Derivatives Transactions\n(as defined below) and certain other\ntransactions notwithstanding the restrictions\non the issuance of \u201c senior securities \u201d under\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act.\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act,\namong other things, prohibits open-end funds,\nincluding the Fund, from issuing or selling\nany \u201c senior security, \u201d other than borrowing\nfrom a bank (subject to a requirement to\nmaintain 300% \u201c asset coverage \u201d ). Under Rule\n18f-4, \u201c Derivatives Transactions \u201d include\nthe following: (1) any swap, security-based\nswap (including a contract for differences),\nfutures contract, forward contract, option\n(excluding purchased options), any combination\nof the foregoing, or any similar instrument,\nunder which the Fund is or may be required to\nmake any payment or delivery of cash or other\nassets during the life of the instrument or at\nmaturity or early termination, whether as\nmargin or settlement payment or otherwise; (2)\nany short sale borrowing; (3) reverse\nrepurchase agreements and similar financing\ntransactions ( e.g ., recourse and non-\nrecourse tender option bonds, and borrowed\nbonds), if the Fund elects to treat these\ntransactions as Derivatives Transactions under\nRule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-\nsettling securities ( e.g. , firm and standby\ncommitments, including to-be-announced ( \u201c TBA\n\u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-\nstandard settlement cycle securities, unless\nthe Fund intends to physically settle the\ntransaction and the transaction will settle\nwithin 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\n\n6\n\nUnless the Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires the Fund\nto adopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if the Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Repurchase\nAgreements. A repurchase agreement is an\ninstrument under which the purchaser ( i.e. ,\nthe Fund) acquires a security and the seller\nagrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase\nthe security at a mutually agreed-upon time\nand price, thereby determining the yield\nduring the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by the Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Fund may suffer\ntime delays and incur costs or losses in\nconnection with the disposition of the\ncollateral. In any repurchase transaction, the\ncollateral for a repurchase agreement may\ninclude: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations\nissued by the U.S. government or its agencies\nor instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations\nthat, at the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for\nthe Fund, should it decide to utilize them.\nSuch risks are not unique to the Fund, but are\ninherent in repurchase agreements. The Fund\nseeks to minimize such risks, but because of\nthe inherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, the Fund\nwould likely retain the status of an unsecured\ncreditor of the counterparty ( i.e. , the\nposition the Fund would normally be in if it\nwere to hold, pursuant to its investment\npolicies, other unsecured debt securities of\nthe defaulting counterparty) with respect to\nthe amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured\ncreditor, the Fund would be at risk of losing\nsome or all of the principal and income\ninvolved in the transaction. Securities of\nInvestment Companies. The Fund may invest in\nthe securities of other investment companies\n(including money market funds) to the extent\npermitted by law, regulation, exemptive order\nor SEC staff guidance. Under the 1940 Act, a\nfund\u2019s investment in investment companies is\nlimited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i)\n3% of the total outstanding voting stock of\nany one investment company, (ii) 5% of the\nfund\u2019s total assets with respect to any one\ninvestment company, and (iii) 10% of the\nfund\u2019s total assets with respect to investment\ncompanies in the aggregate. Other investment\ncompanies in which the Fund invests can be\nexpected to incur fees and expenses for\noperations, such as investment advisory and\nadministration fees, which would be in\naddition to those incurred by the Fund.\nPursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff,\nfees and expenses of money market funds used\nfor cash collateral received in connection\nwith loans of securities are not treated as\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect\na fund's pro rata share of the fees and\nexpenses incurred by investing in other\ninvestment companies. Short-Term Instruments\nand Temporary Investments. The Fund may invest\nin short-term instruments, including money\nmarket instruments, on an ongoing basis to\nprovide liquidity or for other reasons. Money\nmarket instruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include, but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by BFA or otherwise\naffiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued\nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities (including\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c CDs \u201d\n), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed-time deposits\nand other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S.\nbanks (including non-U.S. branches) and\nsimilar institutions; (iv) commercial paper\nrated, at the date of purchase, \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by\nMoody's, \u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch, or \u201c A-1 \u201d by S&P\nGlobal Ratings, or if unrated, of comparable\nquality as determined by BFA; (v) non-\nconvertible corporate debt securities ( e.g. ,\n\n7\n\nbonds and debentures) with remaining\nmaturities at the date of purchase of not more\nthan 397 days and that have been determined to\npresent minimal credit risks, in accordance\nwith the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7\nunder the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase\nagreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-\ndenominated obligations of non-U.S. banks\n(including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion\nof BFA, are of comparable quality to\nobligations of U.S. banks that may be\npurchased by the Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions. Future\nDevelopments. The Board may, in the future,\nauthorize the Fund to invest in securities\ncontracts and investments, other than those\nlisted in this SAI and in the Prospectus,\nprovided they are consistent with the Fund's\ninvestment objective and do not violate any of\nits investment restrictions or policies.\nGeneral Considerations and Risks A discussion\nof some of the principal risks associated with\nan investment in the Fund is contained in the\nFund's Prospectus. An investment in the Fund\nshould be made with an understanding that the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of bonds in\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause the Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. Borrowing may cause the Fund to\nliquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy its\nobligations. Illiquid Investments Risk. The\nFund may not acquire any illiquid investment\nif, immediately after the acquisition, the\nFund would have invested more than 15% of its\nnet assets in illiquid investments. An\nilliquid investment is any investment that the\nFund reasonably expects cannot be sold or\ndisposed of in current market conditions in\nseven calendar days or less without\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. The liquidity of an investment\nwill be determined based on relevant market,\ntrading and investment specific considerations\nas set out in the Liquidity Program as\nrequired by the Liquidity Rule. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount to\ncomparable, more liquid investments and the\nFund may not be able to dispose of illiquid\ninvestments in a timely fashion or at their\nexpected prices. If illiquid investments\nexceed 15% of the Fund\u2019s net assets, the\nLiquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will\nrequire that certain remedial actions be\ntaken. Infectious Illness Risk. A widespread\noutbreak of an infectious illness, such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the\neconomies of many nations and the global\neconomy and may impact individual issuers and\ncapital markets in ways that cannot be\nforeseen. An infectious illness outbreak may\nresult in travel restrictions, closed\ninternational borders, disruption of\nhealthcare services, prolonged quarantines,\ncancellations, supply chain disruptions,\ntemporary and permanent business closures,\nlower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings\ndowngrades, credit defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and political\nimpacts, as well as general concern and\nuncertainty. An outbreak may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social and economic\nrisks in certain countries or globally. These\nimpacts, which could adversely affect a Fund\nand its investments, could be present for an\nextended period of time. In addition, markets\nmay experience temporary closures, extreme\nvolatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity\nand increased trading costs. Such events may\nadversely affect a Fund and its investments\nand may impact a Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or\nsell securities or other assets. Market or\neconomic disruptions could cause elevated\ntracking error and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to a Fund's NAV. Additionally, a\nFund could be adversely impacted if an\noutbreak impairs the operations of its service\nproviders, including BFA. Governmental and\nquasi-governmental may respond to an outbreak\nand any resulting disruptions with a variety\nof fiscal and monetary policy changes, such as\nchanges in interest rates. A reversal of these\npolicies, or the ineffectiveness of such\npolicies, is likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely affect a\nFund\u2019s investments. Money Market Instruments\nRisk. The Fund may hold money market\ninstruments. The value of money market\ninstruments may be affected by changes in\ninterest rates or in the credit ratings of the\ninvestments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of the Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance\n\n8\n\nCorporation or any other government agency. It\nis possible to lose money by investing in a\nmoney market fund. Money market funds other\nthan U.S. government money market funds and\nretail money market funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV\ninstead of using a stable $1.00 per share\nprice. Operational Risk. BFA and the Fund's\nother service providers may experience\ndisruptions or operating errors such as\nprocessing errors or human errors, inadequate\nor failed internal or external processes, or\nsystems or technology failures, that could\nnegatively impact the Fund. While service\nproviders are required to have appropriate\noperational risk management policies and\nprocedures, their methods of operational risk\nmanagement may differ from the Fund\u2019s in the\nsetting of priorities, the personnel and\nresources available or the effectiveness of\nrelevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring\nand oversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect\nthe Fund or to develop processes and controls\nto completely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Reference Rate\nReplacement Risk. The Fund may be exposed to\nfinancial instruments that recently\ntransitioned from, or continue to be tied to,\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate ( \u201c LIBOR \u201d\n) to determine payment obligations, financing\nterms, hedging strategies or investment value.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct\nAuthority ( \u201c FCA \u201d ), which regulates LIBOR,\nhas ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In\nApril 2023, however, the FCA announced that\nsome USD LIBOR settings will continue to be\npublished under a synthetic methodology until\nSeptember 30, 2024 for certain legacy\ncontracts. The Secured Overnight Financing\nRate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which is a broad measure of\nthe cost of borrowing cash overnight\ncollateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in\nthe repurchase agreement market, has been used\nincreasingly on a voluntary basis in new\ninstruments and transactions. Under U.S.\nregulations that implement a statutory\nfallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark\nrates based on SOFR have replaced LIBOR in\ndifferent categories of financial contracts.\nNeither the effect of the LIBOR transition\nprocess nor its ultimate success can yet be\nknown. While some existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate-setting methodology, there\nmay be significant uncertainty regarding the\neffectiveness of any such alternative\nmethodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all\nexisting LIBOR-based instruments may have\nalternative rate-setting provisions and there\nremains uncertainty regarding the willingness\nand ability of issuers to add alternative\nrate-setting provisions in certain existing\ninstruments. Parties to contracts, securities,\nor other instruments using LIBOR may disagree\non transition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. The Fund may have\ninstruments linked to other interbank offered\nrates that may also cease to be published in\nthe future. Risk of Futures and Options on\nFutures Transactions. There are several risks\naccompanying the utilization of futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts. A\nposition in futures contracts and options on\nfutures contracts may be closed only on the\nexchange on which the contract was made (or a\nlinked exchange). While the Fund plans to\nutilize futures contracts only if an active\nmarket exists for such contracts, there is no\nguarantee that a liquid market will exist for\nthe contract at a specified time. Futures\ncontracts, by definition, project price levels\nin the future and not current levels of\nvaluation; therefore, market circumstances may\nresult in a discrepancy between the price of\nthe future and the movement in the Fund's\nUnderlying Index. In the event of adverse\nprice movements, the Fund would continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if the Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, the Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, intends to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit the risk exposure to levels\ncomparable to a direct investment in the types\nof stocks in which it invests. Utilization of\nfutures and options on futures by the Fund\ninvolves the risk of imperfect or even\nnegative correlation to the Underlying Index\nif the index underlying the futures contract\ndiffers from the Underlying Index. There is\nalso the risk of loss of margin deposits in\nthe event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom\nthe Fund has an open position in the futures\ncontract or\n\n9\n\noption. The purchase of put or call options\nwill be based upon predictions by BFA as to\nanticipated trends, which predictions could\nprove to be incorrect. Because the futures\nmarket generally imposes less burdensome\nmargin requirements than the securities\nmarket, an increased amount of participation\nby speculators in the futures market could\nresult in price fluctuations. Certain\nfinancial futures exchanges limit the amount\nof fluctuation permitted in futures contract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\nlimit establishes the maximum amount by which\nthe price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting the Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, the Fund\nwould be required to make daily cash payments\nof variation margin. U.S. Treasury Obligations\nRisk. U.S. Treasury obligations may differ\nfrom other securities in their interest rates,\nmaturities, times of issuance and other\ncharacteristics. Similar to other issuers,\nchanges to the financial condition or credit\nrating of the U.S. government may cause the\nvalue of the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations\nto decline. U.S. Treasury securities are rated\nAA+ by S&P Global Ratings. A downgrade of the\nrating of U.S. Treasury securities may cause\nthe value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Because U.S.\ngovernment debt obligations are often used as\na benchmark for other borrowing arrangements,\na downgrade could also result in higher\ninterest rates for a range of borrowers, cause\ndisruptions in the international bond markets\nand have a substantial adverse effect on the\nU.S. and global economy. A high national debt\nlevel may increase market pressures to meet\ngovernment funding needs, which may drive debt\ncost higher and lead the government to issue\nadditional debt, thereby increasing\nrefinancing risk. A high national debt also\nraises concerns that the U.S. government will\nnot be able to make principal or interest\npayments when they are due. If market\nparticipants determine that U.S. sovereign\ndebt levels have become unsustainable, the\nvalue of the U.S. dollar could decline, thus\nincreasing inflationary pressures,\nparticularly with respect to services\noutsourced to non-U.S. providers and imported\ngoods and constrain or prevent the U.S.\ngovernment from implementing effective\ncountercyclical fiscal policy in economic\ndownturns. Direct obligations of the U.S.\nTreasury have historically involved little\nrisk of loss of principal if held to maturity.\nHowever, due to fluctuations in interest\nrates, the market value of such securities may\nvary during the period that shareholders own\nshares of the Fund. Notwithstanding that U.S.\nTreasury obligations are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S., circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent the timely\npayment of interest or principal, such as\nreaching the legislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in losses to the\nFund and substantial negative consequences for\nthe U.S. economy and the global financial\nsystem. Proxy Voting Policies The Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for each\nFund\u2019s securities to BFA pursuant to (i) the\nOpen-End Active and Fixed Income Index Fund\nProxy Voting Policy (the \u201c Active Fund Proxy\nVoting Policy \u201d ), with respect to certain\nFunds, and (ii) the Index Equity Fund Proxy\nVoting Policy, with respect to certain other\nFunds, as applicable. Please refer to the\ntable below, which discloses the policy\napplicable to each Fund in this SAI.\nInformation that does not apply to a Fund does\nnot form a part of that Fund\u2019s SAI and should\nnot be relied on by investors in that Fund.\nOnly information that is clearly identified as\napplicable to a Fund is considered to form a\npart of that Fund\u2019s SAI. With respect to Funds\ncovered by the Active Fund Proxy Voting\nPolicy, BFA has adopted the BlackRock Active\nInvestment Stewardship - Global Engagement and\nVoting Guidelines (the \u201c BAIS Guidelines \u201d ).\nCertain of such Funds, as listed within the\nActive Fund Proxy Voting Policy and as\ndisclosed in the table below, follow\nsupplemental guidelines within the BAIS\nGuidelines that are applicable to certain\nclimate and decarbonization issues (the \u201c BAIS\nClimate and Decarbonization Stewardship\nGuidelines \u201d ). With respect to Funds covered\nby the Index Equity Fund Proxy Voting Policy,\nBFA has adopted the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship ( \u201c BIS \u201d ) Global Benchmark\nPolicy, comprised of the Global Principles for\nBenchmark Policies, regional voting\nguidelines, and engagement priorities, which\nare each available upon request. In addition,\ncertain of such Funds, as listed within the\nIndex Equity Fund Proxy Voting Policy and as\ndisclosed in the table below, follow\nsupplemental guidelines that are applicable to\ncertain climate and decarbonization issues\n(the \u201c BIS Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship Guidelines \u201d ).\n\n10\n                                              \n          Open-E\u2026           Index             \n          and      BAIS     Equity   BIS      \n  Fund    FixedI\u2026  Climat\u2026  Fund     Climat\u2026  \n          IndexF\u2026  Decarb\u2026  ProxyV\u2026  Decarb\u2026  \n          ProxyV\u2026  Apply    Policy   Apply    \n          Policy                              \n  iShar\u2026                                      \n  iBonds                                      \n  Dec                                         \n  2055    X                                   \n  Term                                        \n  Treas\u2026                                      \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nIf a Fund invests in an underlying fund\nmanaged by BlackRock, the Fund will use its\nproxy voting policy when voting on proxies for\nthe underlying fund while the underlying fund\nwill use its proxy voting policy when voting\nproxies on investments the underlying fund\nholds. Therefore, the Fund may use the Active\nFund Proxy Voting Policy while an underlying\nfund may use the Index Equity Fund Proxy\nVoting Policy, and the opposite is also true.\nCopies of the Active Fund Proxy Voting Policy,\nIndex Equity Fund Proxy Voting Policy, the\nBAIS Guidelines, the Global Principles for\nBenchmark Policies and the BIS Climate and\nDecarbonization Stewardship Guidelines are\nincluded in Appendix A of this SAI.\nInformation with respect to how proxies\nrelating to each Fund\u2019s portfolio securities,\nwhen available, were voted during the 12-month\nperiod ended June 30 is available: (i) without\ncharge, upon request, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Fund\u2019s website\nat www.blackrock.com/proxyrecords; and (ii) on\nthe SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov. Portfolio\nHoldings Information On each Business Day (as\ndefined in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI), prior to\nthe opening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, the Fund discloses\non its website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of the Fund\u2019s next\nnet asset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: The Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of the Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to the Fund to\nsettle purchases of the Fund ( i.e. Deposit\nSecurities) or that Authorized Participants\nwould receive from the Fund to settle\nredemptions of the Fund ( i.e. Fund\nSecurities). These files are known as the\nPortfolio Composition File and the Fund Data\nFile (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The Files are\napplicable for the next trading day and are\nprovided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an Authorized Participant or liquidity\nprovider the securities the Fund is willing to\naccept for a creation, and securities that the\nFund will provide on a redemption. BFA\nemployees may also discuss portfolio holdings-\nrelated information with broker/dealers, in\nconnection with settling the Fund\u2019s\ntransactions, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with the disclosure in the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent registration statement. \u2022\nCommunications with Listing Exchanges: From\ntime to time, employees of BFA may discuss\nportfolio holdings information with the\napplicable primary listing exchange for the\nFund as needed to meet the exchange listing\nstandards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFund, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with\n\n11\n\napplicable policies, agreements with the Fund,\nthe terms of the current registration\nstatements and federal securities laws and\nregulations thereunder. \u2022 Liquidity Metrics: \u201c\nLiquidity Metrics, \u201d which seek to ascertain\nthe Fund\u2019s liquidity profile under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology, include but\nare not limited to: (a) disclosure regarding\nthe number of days needed to liquidate a\nportfolio or the portfolio\u2019s underlying\ninvestments; and (b) the percentage of the\nFund\u2019s NAV invested in a particular liquidity\ntier under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity risk\nmethodology. The dissemination of position-\nlevel liquidity metrics data and any non-\npublic regulatory data pursuant to the\nLiquidity Rule (including SEC liquidity\ntiering) is not permitted unless pre-approved.\nDisclosure of portfolio-level liquidity\nmetrics prior to 60 calendar days after\ncalendar quarter-end requires a non-disclosure\nor confidentiality agreement and approval of\nthe Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer.\nPortfolio-level liquidity metrics disclosure\nsubsequent to 60 calendar days after calendar\nquarter-end requires the approval of portfolio\nmanagement and must be disclosed to all\nparties requesting the information if\ndisclosed to any party. The Trust\u2019s Chief\nCompliance Officer or his delegate may\nauthorize disclosure of portfolio holdings\ninformation pursuant to the above policy and\nprocedures, subject to restrictions on\nselective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nConstruction and Maintenance of the Underlying\nIndex A description of the Fund's Underlying\nIndex is provided below. With respect to\ncertain underlying indexes of the iShares\nfunds, BFA or its affiliates have held\ndiscussions with the applicable index provider\nregarding their business interest in licensing\nan index to track a particular market segment\nand conveyed investment concepts and\nstrategies that could be considered for the\nindex. The index provider designed and\nconstituted such indices using concepts\nconveyed by BFA or its affiliates. For certain\nof these indices, the relevant fund may be the\nfirst or sole user of the underlying index. In\nits sole discretion, the index provider\ndetermines the composition of the securities\nand other instruments in such underlying\nindex, the rebalance protocols of the\nunderlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and other instruments in the\nunderlying index, and any updates to the\nmethodology. From time to time, BFA or its\naffiliates may also provide input relating to\npossible methodology changes of such\nunderlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\nThe ICE \u00ae Term Maturity US Treasury Index ICE\n2055 Maturity US Treasury Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 1 Index Description.\nThe ICE 2055 Maturity US Treasury Index\nmeasures the performance of U.S. Treasury\nbonds scheduled to mature between January 1,\n2055 and December 15, 2055, inclusive. The\nUnderlying Index consists of publicly-issued\nU.S. Treasury securities that are scheduled to\nmature between January 1, 2055 and December\n15, 2055, inclusive. Qualifying securities are\nU.S. Treasury notes and bonds having $1\nbillion or more of outstanding face value,\nexcluding amounts held by the Federal Reserve\nSystem Open Market Account ( \u201c SOMA \u201d ). In\naddition, the securities in the Underlying\nIndex must have a fixed coupon schedule and be\ndenominated in U.S. dollars. Excluded from the\nUnderlying Index are inflation-linked\nsecurities, Treasury bills and Separate\nTrading of Registered Interest and Principal\nof Securities (STRIPS). However, the amounts\noutstanding of qualifying securities in the\nUnderlying Index are not reduced by any\nindividual components of such securities\n(i.e., coupon or principal) that have been\nstripped after inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex. Securities issued or marketed primarily\nto retail investors do not qualify for\ninclusion in the Underlying Index. The\nUnderlying Index is market value-weighted\nbased on amounts outstanding reduced by\namounts held by the Federal Reserve SOMA times\nprice plus accrued interest. Accrued interest\nis calculated assuming next-day settlement.\nThe Underlying Index is rebalanced on the last\ncalendar day of the month, based on\ninformation available up to and including the\n\n12\n\nthird business day before the last business\nday of the month. New issues must settle on or\nbefore the following calendar month end\nrebalancing date in order to qualify for\ninclusion for such following month (e.g., an\nissue must settle on or before November 30 in\norder to be included in the index on October\n31). The securities in the Underlying Index\nare updated on the last calendar day of each\nmonth. Cash flows from bond payments that are\nreceived during the month are retained in the\nUnderlying Index until the end of the month\nand then are removed as part of the\nrebalancing. When cash or a security is\nremoved as part of the rebalancing, it\neffectively increases the weighting of the\nremaining securities in the Underlying Index,\nand the Fund is required to invest in the\nremaining securities to bring its holdings in\nline with the Underlying Index. Cash does not\nearn any reinvestment income while it is held\nin the Underlying Index. In the last six\nmonths of operation, as the bonds held by the\nFund mature, the proceeds will typically be\nreinvested by the Fund in investments already\nin the Underlying Index but may also be\ninvested in other cash and cash equivalents as\ndetermined by BFA. To the extent that the Fund\ninvests in money market or similar funds, it\nwill incur the fees and expenses of such\nfunds. By December 15, 2055, the Fund is\nexpected to consist almost entirely of cash.\nInvestment Policies The Board has adopted as\nfundamental policies the following numbered\ninvestment policies, which cannot be changed\nwithout the approval of the holders of a\nmajority of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. A vote of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund is\ndefined in the Investment Company Act as the\nlesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities present at a shareholder meeting,\nif the holders of more than 50% of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (ii) more\nthan 50% of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund. The Fund has also adopted certain\nnon-fundamental investment policies, including\nits investment objective. Non-fundamental\ninvestment policies may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval. Therefore,\nthe Fund may change its investment objective\nand its Underlying Index without shareholder\napproval. Fundamental Investment Policies The\nFund may not: 1. Concentrate its investments\nin a particular industry, as that term is used\nin the Investment Company Act, except that the\nFund will concentrate to approximately the\nsame extent that its Underlying Index\nconcentrates in the securities of a particular\nindustry or group of industries. 2. Borrow\nmoney, except as permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act. 3. Issue senior\nsecurities to the extent such issuance would\nviolate the Investment Company Act. 4.\nPurchase or hold real estate, except the Fund\nmay purchase and hold securities or other\ninstruments that are secured by, or linked to,\nreal estate or interests therein, securities\nof REITs, mortgage-related securities and\nsecurities of issuers engaged in the real\nestate business, and the Fund may purchase and\nhold real estate as a result of the ownership\nof securities or other instruments. 5.\nUnderwrite securities issued by others, except\nto the extent that the sale of portfolio\nsecurities by the Fund may be deemed to be an\nunderwriting or as otherwise permitted by\napplicable law. 6. Purchase or sell\ncommodities or commodity contracts, except as\npermitted by the Investment Company Act. 7.\nMake loans to the extent prohibited by the\nInvestment Company Act. Notations Regarding\nthe Fund's Fundamental Investment Policies The\nfollowing notations are not considered to be\npart of the Fund\u2019s fundamental investment\npolicies and are subject to change without\nshareholder approval. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to concentration\nset forth in (1) above, the Investment Company\nAct does not define what constitutes \u201c\nconcentration \u201d in an industry. The SEC staff\nhas taken the position that investment of 25%\nor more of a fund\u2019s total assets in one or\nmore issuers conducting their principal\nactivities in the same industry or group of\nindustries constitutes concentration. It is\npossible that interpretations of concentration\ncould change in the future. The policy in (1)\nabove will be interpreted to refer to\nconcentration as that term may be interpreted\nfrom time to time. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to permit investment without limit\nin the following: securities of the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; securities of state,\nterritory, possession or municipal governments\nand their authorities, agencies,\n\n13\n\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\nthe Fund's industry classifications, the Fund\ncurrently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to the\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits the Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund's total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires the Fund to maintain at all times\nan \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300% of the\namount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means\nthe ratio that the value of the Fund's total\nassets (including amounts borrowed), minus\nliabilities other than borrowings, bears to\nthe aggregate amount of all borrowings.\nBorrowing money to increase portfolio holdings\nis known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d Certain trading\npractices and investments, such as reverse\nrepurchase agreements, may be considered to be\nborrowings or involve leverage and thus are\nsubject to the Investment Company Act\nrestrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4\nunder the Investment Company Act, when the\nFund engages in reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions, the Fund\nmay either (i) maintain asset coverage of at\nleast 300% with respect to such transactions\nand any other borrowings in the aggregate, or\n(ii) treat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of a fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the business of underwriting, the\npolicy in (5) above will be interpreted not to\nprevent a fund from engaging in transactions\ninvolving the acquisition or disposition of\nportfolio securities, regardless of whether a\nfund may be considered to be an underwriter\nunder the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in\nthe underwriting business to the extent\npermitted by applicable law. With respect to\nthe fundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit the Fund from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies of the\nFund Under its non-fundamental investment\nrestrictions, which may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval, the Fund\nmay not: 1. Purchase shares of any registered\nopen-end investment company or registered unit\ninvestment trust, in reliance on Section\n12(d)(1)(F) or (G) of the Investment Company\nAct, at any time the Fund has knowledge that\nits shares are purchased by another investment\ncompany investor in reliance on the provisions\nof subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1). The\nforegoing restriction does not restrict the\nFund from acquiring the shares of registered\nopen-end investment companies to the extent\notherwise permissible under other provisions\nof the 1940 Act, as interpreted, modified or\notherwise permitted by regulatory authority\nhaving jurisdiction, from time to time.\n\n14\n\n2. In accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the\n1940 Act, under normal circumstances, invest\nless than 80% of the value of its net assets,\nplus the amount of any borrowings for\ninvestment purposes, in the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index. The Fund\nwill notify its shareholders at least 60 days\nprior to any change in its restrictions\ndescribed in 2 above. Notations Regarding the\nFund\u2019s Fundamental and Non-Fundamental\nInvestment Policies Unless otherwise\nindicated, all limitations under the Fund\u2019s\nfundamental or non-fundamental investment\nrestrictions apply only at the time that a\ntransaction is undertaken. Any change in the\npercentage of the Fund\u2019s assets invested in\ncertain securities or other instruments\nresulting from market fluctuations or other\nchanges in the Fund\u2019s total assets will not\nrequire the Fund to dispose of an investment.\nContinuous Offering The method by which\nCreation Units are created and traded may\nraise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Fund on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery requirement and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client\nmay be deemed a statutory underwriter if it\ntakes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into\nconstituent shares and sells such shares\ndirectly to customers or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of new shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the 1933 Act must take into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-\ndealer or its client in the particular case\nand the examples mentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions\nin shares, whether or not participating in the\ndistribution of shares, generally are required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in\nrespect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus delivery obligation with\nrespect to shares of the Fund are reminded\nthat, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act,\na prospectus delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange\nmember in connection with a sale on the\nListing Exchange generally is satisfied by the\nfact that the prospectus is available at the\nListing Exchange upon request. The prospectus\ndelivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\nan exchange. Management Trustees and Officers.\nThe Board has responsibility for the overall\nmanagement and operations of the Fund,\nincluding general supervision of the duties\nperformed by BFA and other service providers.\nEach Trustee serves until he or she resigns,\nis removed, dies, retires or becomes\nincapacitated. Each officer shall hold office\nuntil his or her successor is elected and\nqualifies or until his or her death,\nresignation or removal. Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Trust are referred to as\nindependent trustees ( \u201c Independent Trustees\n\u201d ). The registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nBlackRock-advised Funds \u201d ) are organized into\nthe BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex, the\nBlackRock Fixed-Income Complex and the iShares\nComplex (each, a \u201c BlackRock Fund Complex \u201d ).\nThe Fund is included in the iShares Complex,\nwhich includes iShares Trust, iShares U.S. ETF\nTrust, and iShares, Inc. Each Trustee also\nserves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a\nTrustee of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a\nresult, oversees all of the funds within the\niShares Complex, which consists of 423 funds\nas of March 21, 2025. With the exception of\nStephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron\nWasserman, the address of each Trustee and\nofficer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address\nof Mr. Kapito and Mr. Wasserman is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001. The address of Mr. Cohen is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., Drapers Gardens, 12\nThrogmorton Avenue, London EC2N 2DL United\nKingdom.

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Fund rests\nwith the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to\nmanage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The\nBoard is responsible for overseeing BFA and\nother service providers in the operations of\nthe Fund in accordance with the provisions of\nthe 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state\nand other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The\nBoard is currently composed of eleven members,\nnine of whom are Independent Trustees. The\nBoard currently conducts regular in person\nmeetings four times a year. In addition, the\nBoard frequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The Independent Trustees meet\nregularly outside the presence of management,\nin executive session or with other service\nproviders to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Fund, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Fund with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the oversight functions delegated to\nthe Committee by the Board and reports its\nfinding to the Board. The Board and each\nstanding Committee conduct annual assessments\nof their oversight function and structure. The\nBoard has determined that the Board\u2019s\nleadership structure is appropriate because it\nallows the Board to exercise independent\njudgment over management and it allocates\nareas of responsibility among committees of\nIndependent Trustees and the full Board to\nenhance effective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Fund is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. The\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Fund. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of the\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Fund. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by the Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting the Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Fund's\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support the Fund as\nwell as test results.\n\n23\n\nBoard oversight of risk is also performed as\nneeded between meetings through communications\nbetween BFA and the Board. The Independent\nTrustees have engaged independent legal\ncounsel to assist them in performing their\noversight responsibilities. From time to time,\nthe Board may modify the manner in which it\nconducts risk oversight. The Board\u2019s oversight\nrole does not make it a guarantor of the\nFund's investment performance or other\nactivities. Committees of the Board of\nTrustees.

Control Persons and\nPrincipal Holders of Securities. Ownership\ninformation is not provided for the Fund, as\nit has not commenced operations as of the date\nof this SAI. Conflicts of Interest. Certain\nactivities of BlackRock, Inc., BlackRock\nAdvisors, LLC, BlackRock Fund Advisors and the\nother subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc.\n(collectively referred to in this section as \u201c\nBlackRock \u201d ) and their respective directors,\nofficers or employees, with respect to the\nFunds and/or other accounts managed by\nBlackRock, may give rise to actual or\nperceived conflicts of interest such as those\ndescribed below. BlackRock is one of the\nworld\u2019s largest asset management firms.\nBlackRock, its subsidiaries and their\nrespective directors, officers and employees,\nincluding the business units or entities and\npersonnel who may be involved in the\ninvestment activities and business operations\nof a Fund, are engaged worldwide in\nbusinesses, including managing equities, fixed\nincome securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and other financial services, and\nhave interests other than that of managing the\nFunds. These are considerations of which\ninvestors in a Fund should be aware, and which\nmay cause conflicts of interest that could\ndisadvantage a Fund and its shareholders.\nThese businesses and interests include\npotential multiple advisory, transactional,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by a Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients\n\n29\n\nand, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As\nsuch, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged\nin transactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\na Fund\u2019s performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or client accounts, will be executed\nindependently of a Fund\u2019s transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFund. In addition, the portfolio holdings of\ncertain BlackRock-advised investment vehicles\nmanaged in an identical or substantially\nsimilar manner as certain Funds are made\npublicly available on a more timely basis than\nthe applicable Fund. In some cases, such\nportfolio holdings are made publicly available\non a daily basis. While not expected, it is\npossible that a recipient of portfolio\nholdings information for such an investment\nvehicle could cause harm to a Fund that is\nmanaged in an identical or substantially\nsimilar manner, including by trading ahead of\nor against such Fund based on the information\nreceived. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or\nsell the same assets for client accounts,\nincluding a Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor a Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of a\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding a\nFund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for a Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause a Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so. Conflicts may also\narise because portfolio decisions regarding a\nFund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby a Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and\nthe purchase of a security or covering of a\nshort position in a security by a Fund may\nincrease the price of the same security held\nby (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its\nother accounts or funds. BlackRock, on behalf\nof other client accounts, on the one hand, and\na Fund, on the other hand, may invest in or\nextend credit to different parts of the\ncapital structure of a single issuer.\nBlackRock may pursue rights, provide advice or\nengage in other activities, or refrain from\npursuing rights, providing advice or engaging\nin other activities, on behalf of other\nclients with respect to an issuer in which a\nFund has invested, and such actions (or\nrefraining from action) may have a material\nadverse effect on the Fund. In situations in\nwhich clients of BlackRock (including the\nFunds) hold positions in multiple parts of the\ncapital structure of an issuer, BlackRock may\nnot pursue certain actions or remedies that\nmay be available to a Fund, as a result of\nlegal and regulatory requirements or\notherwise. BlackRock addresses these and other\npotential conflicts of interest based on the\nfacts and circumstances of particular\nsituations. For example, BlackRock may\ndetermine to rely on information barriers\nbetween different business units or portfolio\nmanagement teams. BlackRock may also determine\nto rely on the actions of similarly situated\nholders of loans or securities rather than, or\nin connection with, taking such actions itself\non behalf of the Funds. In addition, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, certain\nFunds may invest their assets in other funds\nadvised by BlackRock, including funds that are\nmanaged by one or more of the same portfolio\nmanagers, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to asset allocation, timing\nof Fund purchases and redemptions or sales,\nand increased remuneration and profitability\nfor BlackRock and/or its personnel, including\nportfolio managers. In certain circumstances,\nBlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to\nbuy from or sell securities to another fund or\naccount advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may\n(but is not required to) effect purchases and\nsales between BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross\ntrades \u201d ), including the Funds, if BlackRock\nbelieves such transactions are appropriate\nbased on each party\u2019s investment objectives\nand guidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or\n\n30\n\nregulatory issues relating to these\ntransactions which could limit BlackRock\u2019s\ndecision to engage in these transactions for\nthe Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially\nconflicting division of loyalties and\nresponsibilities to the parties in such\ntransactions. BlackRock and its clients may\npursue or enforce rights with respect to an\nissuer in which a Fund has invested, and those\nactivities may have an adverse effect on the\nFund. As a result, prices, availability,\nliquidity and terms of the Fund\u2019s investments\nmay be negatively impacted by the activities\nof BlackRock or its clients, and transactions\nfor the Fund may be impaired or effected at\nprices or terms that may be less favorable\nthan would otherwise have been the case. The\nresults of a Fund\u2019s investment activities may\ndiffer significantly from the results achieved\nby BlackRock for its proprietary accounts or\nother accounts (including investment companies\nor collective investment vehicles) that it\nmanages or advises. It is possible that one or\nmore accounts managed or advised by BlackRock\nand such other accounts will achieve\ninvestment results that are substantially more\nor less favorable than the results achieved by\na Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund\nwill sustain losses during periods in which\none or more proprietary or other accounts\nmanaged or advised by BlackRock achieve\nsignificant profits. The opposite result is\nalso possible. From time to time, a Fund may\nbe restricted from purchasing or selling\nsecurities, or from engaging in other\ninvestment activities because of regulatory,\nlegal or contractual requirements applicable\nto BlackRock or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock, and/or the internal\npolicies of BlackRock designed to comply with\nsuch requirements. As a result, there may be\nperiods, for example, when BlackRock will not\ninitiate or recommend certain types of\ntransactions in certain securities or\ninstruments with respect to which BlackRock is\nperforming services or when position limits\nhave been reached. For example, the investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and accounts under its management may\nlimit the investment opportunities for a Fund\nin certain emerging and other markets in which\nlimitations are imposed upon the amount of\ninvestment, in the aggregate or in individual\nissuers, by affiliated foreign investors. In\nconnection with its management of a Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on behalf of a Fund in\naccordance with such analysis and models. In\naddition, BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to make available any information\nregarding its proprietary activities or\nstrategies, or the activities or strategies\nused for other accounts managed by them, for\nthe benefit of the management of a Fund and it\nis not anticipated that BlackRock will have\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the\nactivities or strategies used for accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock or other client accounts\ncould conflict with the transactions and\nstrategies employed by BlackRock in managing a\nFund. The Funds may be included in investment\nmodels developed by BlackRock for use by\nclients and financial advisors. To the extent\nclients invest in these investment models and\nincrease the assets under management of the\nFunds, the investment management fee amounts\npaid by the Funds to BlackRock may also\nincrease. The net asset value and liquidity of\na Fund may be impacted by purchases and sales\nof the Fund by model-driven investment\nportfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself and\nby its advisory clients. In addition, certain\nprincipals and certain employees of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment adviser are also principals or\nemployees of other business units or entities\nwithin BlackRock. As a result, these\nprincipals and employees may have obligations\nto such other business units or entities or\ntheir clients and such obligations to other\nbusiness units or entities or their clients\nmay be a consideration of which investors in a\nFund should be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund\nin which clients of BlackRock, or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock, serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty\u2019s interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by a Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for\nclients, the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments of which may be those in which\na Fund invests or which may be based on the\nperformance of the Fund. Additionally, an\naffiliate of BlackRock will create, write or\nissue options, which may be based on the\nperformance of certain Funds. BlackRock has\nentered into an arrangement with Markit\nIndices Limited, the index provider for\nunderlying fixed-income indexes used by\ncertain iShares ETFs, related to derivative\nfixed-income products that are based on such\niShares ETFs. Trading activity in these\nderivative products could also potentially\nlead to greater liquidity for such products,\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares ETFs and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. A Fund may, subject\nto applicable law,\n\n31\n\npurchase investments that are the subject of\nan underwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse to those\nof the Fund. At times, these activities may\ncause business units or entities within\nBlackRock to give advice to clients that may\ncause these clients to take actions adverse to\nthe interests of the Fund. To the extent such\ntransactions are permitted, a Fund will deal\nwith BlackRock on an arms-length basis. To the\nextent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock\nmay act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or\nadviser or in other commercial capacities for\na Fund. It is anticipated that the\ncommissions, mark-ups, markdowns, financial\nadvisory fees, underwriting and placement\nfees, sales fees, financing and commitment\nfees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation\nor profits, rates, terms and conditions\ncharged by BlackRock will be in its view\ncommercially reasonable, although BlackRock,\nincluding its sales personnel, will have an\ninterest in obtaining fees and other amounts\nthat are favorable to BlackRock and such sales\npersonnel, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Funds. Index based funds may use an index\nprovider that is affiliated with another\nservice provider of the Fund or BlackRock that\nacts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in\nother commercial capacities for a Fund or\nBlackRock. Subject to applicable law,\nBlackRock (and its personnel and other\ndistributors) will be entitled to retain fees\nand other amounts that they receive in\nconnection with their service to the Funds as\nbroker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in\nother commercial capacities. No accounting to\nthe Funds or their shareholders will be\nrequired, and no fees or other compensation\npayable by the Funds or their shareholders\nwill be reduced by reason of receipt by\nBlackRock of any such fees or other amounts.\nWhen BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities in\nrelation to the Funds, BlackRock may take\ncommercial steps in its own interests, which\nmay have an adverse effect on the Funds. A\nFund will be required to establish business\nrelationships with its counterparties based on\nthe Fund\u2019s own credit standing. BlackRock will\nnot have any obligation to allow its credit to\nbe used in connection with a Fund\u2019s\nestablishment of its business relationships,\nnor is it expected that the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparties will rely on the credit of\nBlackRock in evaluating the Fund\u2019s\ncreditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBlackRock, pursuant to SEC exemptive relief,\nacts as securities lending agent to, and\nreceives a share of securities lending\nrevenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also\nreceive compensation for managing the\nreinvestment of the cash collateral from\nsecurities lending. There are potential\nconflicts of interests in managing a\nsecurities lending program, including but not\nlimited to: (i) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to, among\nother things, increase or decrease the amount\nof securities on loan or to lend particular\nsecurities in order to generate additional\nrisk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its\naffiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to\nallocate loans to clients that would provide\nmore revenue to BlackRock. As described\nfurther below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate\nthis conflict by providing its securities\nlending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Funds and certain other\nclients and/ or funds against a shortfall in\ncollateral in the event of borrower default.\nOn a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the\npotential dollar exposure of collateral\nshortfall resulting from a borrower default (\n\u201c shortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock may decline\nto make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of a\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. In addition, some\nborrowers may prefer certain BlackRock lenders\nthat provide additional protections against\nlender default that are favored by their\nprudential regulation. BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits\n\n32\n\n( i.e . indemnification exposure limit and\nborrower credit limits); (ii) the lending\nportfolio must hold the asset at the time a\nloan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the\nlending portfolio must also have enough\ninventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for a Fund may be\nbunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Funds will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Funds. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Funds will\nnot be charged the same commission or\ncommission equivalent rates in connection with\na bunched or aggregated order. BlackRock does\nnot currently enter into arrangements to use\nthe Fund\u2019s assets for, or participate in, soft\ndollars, although BlackRock may receive\nresearch that is bundled with the trade\nexecution, clearing, and/or settlement\nservices provided by a particular broker-\ndealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives\nresearch on this basis, many of the same\nconflicts related to traditional soft dollars\nmay exist. For example, the research\neffectively will be paid by client commissions\nthat also will be used to pay for the\nexecution, clearing, and settlement services\nprovided by the broker-dealer and will not be\npaid by BlackRock. Subject to applicable law,\nBlackRock may select brokers that furnish\nBlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client\naccounts or personnel, directly or through\ncorrespondent relationships, with research or\nother appropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock\u2019s view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Funds and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the\nFunds based on the amount of brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Funds and such other\nBlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client\u2019s commissions may not be\nused in managing that client\u2019s account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate benefits, of economies of\nscale or price discounts in connection with\nproducts and services that may be provided to\nthe Funds and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself. BlackRock,\nunless prohibited by applicable law, may\nendeavor to execute trades through brokers\nwho, pursuant to such arrangements, provide\nresearch or other services in order to ensure\nthe continued receipt of research or other\nservices BlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to engage in\nthe above described arrangements to varying\ndegrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by\napplicable law, may also enter into commission\nsharing arrangements under which BlackRock may\nexecute transactions through a broker-dealer\nand request that the broker-dealer allocate a\nportion of the commissions or commission\ncredits to another firm that provides research\nto BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock\nengages in commission sharing arrangements,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. BlackRock\nmay utilize certain electronic crossing\nnetworks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including, without\nlimitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an\ninvestment or other interest, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law) in executing\nclient securities transactions for certain\ntypes of securities. These ECNs may charge\nfees for their services, including access fees\nand transaction fees. The transaction fees,\nwhich are similar to commissions or\nmarkups/markdowns, will generally be charged\nto clients and, like commissions and\nmarkups/markdowns, would generally be included\nin the cost of the securities purchased.\nAccess fees\n\n33\n\nmay be paid by BlackRock even though incurred\nin connection with executing transactions on\nbehalf of clients, including the Funds. In\ncertain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume\ndiscounts that will reduce the access fees\ntypically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nonly utilize ECNs consistent with its\nobligation to seek to obtain best execution in\nclient transactions. BlackRock owns a minority\ninterest in, and is a member of, Members\nExchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly created U.S.\nstock exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be\nexecuted on MEMX if third party brokers select\nMEMX as the appropriate venue for execution of\norders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf\nof client portfolios. In addition,\ntransactions in ETF shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the\nappropriate venue for the execution of such\norders. BlackRock has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent conflicts of\ninterest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Funds, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock\u2019s fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee \u201c Proxy Voting Policies. \u201d It is also\npossible that, from time to time, BlackRock\nand /or its advisory clients (including other\nfunds and separately managed accounts) may,\nsubject to compliance with applicable law,\npurchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing\na Fund\u2019s assets may enhance investment\nflexibility and diversification and may\ncontribute to economies of scale that tend to\nreduce the Fund\u2019s expense ratio. BlackRock\nreserves the right, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, to sell into the market or\nredeem in Creation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of the Fund acquired for its own\naccounts or the account of a BlackRock\nadvisory client. A large sale or redemption of\nshares of the Fund by BlackRock itself or a\nBlackRock advisory client could significantly\nreduce the asset size of the Fund, which might\nhave an adverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio\ndiversification, expense ratio or ability to\ncomply with the listing requirements for the\nFund. It is possible that a Fund may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in transactions with,\ncompanies in which BlackRock has significant\ndebt or equity investments or other interests.\nA Fund may also invest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for which\nBlackRock provides and is compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances. In making\ninvestment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is\nnot permitted to obtain or use material non-\npublic information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock, in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the activities\nof BlackRock may limit a Fund\u2019s flexibility in\npurchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment. BlackRock and\nits personnel and other financial service\nproviders may have interests in promoting\nsales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock\nand its personnel, the remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Funds or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFunds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFunds may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or the Fund, may\nsponsor events (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to the Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients\u2019\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\na Fund\u2019s pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other\n\n34\n\ndata sources unavailable to the Fund\u2019s pricing\nvendors. While BlackRock will generally\ncommunicate its valuation information or\ndeterminations to a Fund\u2019s pricing vendors\nand/or fund accountants, there may be\ninstances where the Fund\u2019s pricing vendors or\nfund accountants assign a different valuation\nto a security or other investment than the\nvaluation for such security or investment\ndetermined or recommended by BlackRock. As\ndisclosed in more detail in \u201c Determination of\nNet Asset Value \u201d in this SAI, when market\nquotations are not readily available or are\nbelieved by BlackRock to be unreliable, a\nFund\u2019s investments are valued at fair value by\nBlackRock. BlackRock has been designated as\nthe Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to Rule\n2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and acts\nthrough BlackRock\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees and in accordance\nwith BlackRock\u2019s policies and procedures (the\n\u201c Valuation Procedures \u201d ). When determining a\n\u201c fair value price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks\nto determine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BlackRock\ndeems relevant at the time of the\ndetermination, and may be based on analytical\nvalues determined by BlackRock using\nproprietary or third party valuation models,\nfair value represents only a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. The fair value of one or more\nassets or liabilities may not, in retrospect,\nbe the price at which those assets or\nliabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BlackRock with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, a Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, a Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the Investment Company\nAct, may pay its share of expenses of a money\nmarket fund or other similarly managed private\nfund in which it invests, which may result in\na Fund bearing some additional expenses.\nBlackRock and its directors, officers and\nemployees, may buy and sell securities or\nother investments for their own accounts and\nmay have conflicts of interest with respect to\ninvestments made on behalf of a Fund. As a\nresult of differing trading and investment\nstrategies or constraints, positions may be\ntaken by directors, officers and employees of\nBlackRock that are the same, different from or\nmade at different times than positions taken\nfor the Fund. To lessen the possibility that a\nFund will be adversely affected by this\npersonal trading, the Fund, BRIL and BlackRock\neach have adopted a Code of Ethics in\ncompliance with Section 17(j) of the\nInvestment Company Act that restricts\nsecurities trading in the personal accounts of\ninvestment professionals and others who\nnormally come into possession of information\nregarding the Fund\u2019s portfolio transactions.\nEach Code of Ethics is also available on the\nEDGAR Database on the SEC\u2019s Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\na Fund, except that the Fund may in accordance\nwith rules or guidance adopted under the\nInvestment Company Act engage in transactions\nwith another Fund or accounts that are\naffiliated with the Fund as a result of common\nofficers, directors, or investment advisers or\npursuant to exemptive orders granted to the\nFunds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These\ntransactions would be effected in\ncircumstances in which BlackRock determined\nthat it would be appropriate for the Fund to\npurchase and another client of BlackRock to\nsell, or the Fund to sell and another client\nof BlackRock to purchase, the same security or\ninstrument on the same day. From time to time,\nthe activities of a Fund may be restricted\nbecause of regulatory requirements applicable\nto BlackRock and/or BlackRock\u2019s internal\npolicies designed to comply with, limit the\napplicability of, or otherwise relate to such\nrequirements. A client not advised by\nBlackRock would not be subject to some of\nthose considerations. There may be periods\nwhen BlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of a Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g ., in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which the Funds wish to purchase\nor sell. However, if permitted by applicable\nlaw, and where consistent with BlackRock\u2019s\npolicies and procedures (including the\nnecessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Funds may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies,\n\n35\n\nare the subject of an advisory or risk\nmanagement assignment by BlackRock, or where\npersonnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. BlackRock has adopted\nand implemented policies and procedures that\nare designed to address potential conflicts\nthat arise in connection with the advisory\nservices BlackRock provides to Funds and other\nclients. Certain BlackRock advisory personnel\nmay take views, and make decisions or\nrecommendations, that are different than or\nopposite those of other BlackRock advisory\npersonnel. Certain portfolio management teams\nwithin BlackRock may make decisions or take\n(or refrain from taking) actions with respect\nto clients they advise in a manner different\nthan or adverse to the decisions made or the\nactions taken (or not taken) by the Funds\u2019\nportfolio management teams. The various\nportfolio management teams may not share\ninformation with each other, including as a\nresult of certain information barriers and\nother policies, and will not have any\nobligation or other duty to do so. BlackRock\nhas established certain information barriers\nand other policies to address the sharing of\ninformation between different businesses\nwithin BlackRock, including, effective on or\nabout January 21, 2025, with respect to\npersonnel responsible with managing portfolios\nand voting proxies with respect to certain\nindex equity portfolios versus those\nresponsible for managing portfolios and voting\nproxies with respect to all other portfolios.\nAs a result of information barriers, certain\nunits of BlackRock generally will not have\naccess, or will have limited access, to\ncertain information and personnel, including\nsenior personnel, in other units of BlackRock,\nand generally will not manage the Funds with\nthe benefit of information possessed by such\nother units. Therefore, BlackRock may not be\nable to review potential investments for the\nFunds with the benefit of information held by\ncertain areas of BlackRock. BlackRock may\ndetermine to move certain personnel,\nbusinesses, or business units from one side of\nan information barrier to the other side of\nthe information barrier. In connection\ntherewith, BlackRock personnel, businesses,\nand business units that were moved will no\nlonger have access to the information and\npersonnel from the side of the information\nbarrier from which they were moved.\nInformation obtained in connection with such\nchanges to information barriers may limit or\nrestrict the ability of BlackRock to engage in\nor otherwise effect transactions on behalf of\nthe Funds (including purchasing or selling\nsecurities that BlackRock may otherwise have\npurchased or sold for a client in the absence\nof a change to an information barrier).\nInformation barriers may not have their\nintended impact due to, for example, changes\nin applicable law or inadvertent crossings of\nthe barriers, and actions by personnel on one\nside of a barrier may impact the potential\nactions of personnel on the other side of a\nbarrier. Although the information barriers are\nintended to allow for independent portfolio\nmanagement decision making and proxy voting\namong certain BlackRock businesses, the\ninvestment activities of BlackRock for\nBlackRock clients, as well as BlackRock\u2019s\nproprietary accounts, may nonetheless limit\nthe investment strategies and rights of other\nclients (including the Funds). As BlackRock\u2019s\nassets under management increases, BlackRock\nclients may face greater negative impacts due\nto ownership restrictions and limitations\nimposed by laws, regulations, rules,\nregulators, or issuers. For example, in\ncertain circumstances where a BlackRock client\ninvests in securities issued by companies that\noperate in certain industries ( e.g .,\nbanking, insurance, and utilities) or in\ncertain emerging or international markets, or\nare subject to regulatory or corporate\nownership restrictions ( e.g ., with\nmechanisms such as poison pills in place to\nprevent takeovers), or where a BlackRock\nclient invests in certain futures and\nderivatives, there may be limits on the\naggregate amount invested by BlackRock for its\nclients and BlackRock\u2019s proprietary accounts\nthat may not be exceeded without the grant of\na license or other regulatory or corporate\napproval, order, consent, relief, waiver or\nnon-disapproval or, if exceeded, may cause\nBlackRock or its clients to be subject to\nenforcement actions, disgorgement of share\nownership or profits, regulatory restrictions,\ncomplex compliance reporting, increased\ncompliance costs or suffer disadvantages or\nbusiness restrictions. In light of certain\nrestrictions, BlackRock may also seek to make\nindirect investments ( e.g ., using\nderivatives) on behalf of its clients to\nreceive exposure to certain securities in\nexcess of the applicable ownership\nrestrictions and limitations when legally\npermitted that will expose such clients to\nadditional costs and additional risks,\nincluding any risks associated with investing\nin derivatives. There may be limited\navailability of derivatives that provide\nindirect exposure to an impacted security. In\naddition, BlackRock clients can be subject to\nmore than one ownership limitation depending\non each client\u2019s holdings, and each ownership\nlimitation can impact multiple securities held\nby the client. Certain clients or shareholders\nmay have their own overlapping obligations to\nmonitor their compliance with ownership\nlimitations across their investments. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or a BlackRock client or as a result\nof corporate actions by the issuer, the\nability of BlackRock on behalf of clients to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights (including voting) or\nundertake business transactions, may be\nrestricted by law, regulation, rule, or\norganizational documents or otherwise\nimpaired. For example, to meet the\nrequirements of an ownership limitation or\n\n36\n\nrestriction, a client may be unable to\npurchase or directly hold a security the\nclient would otherwise purchase or hold. The\nlimitation or restriction may be based on the\nholdings of other BlackRock clients instead of\nthe specific client being restricted. For\nindex funds, this means a fund may not be able\nto track its index as closely as it would if\nit was not subject to an ownership limitation\nor restriction because the fund cannot acquire\nthe amount of the impacted security included\nin its index. BlackRock on behalf of its\nclients may limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, utilize indirect investments,\nutilize information barriers, or otherwise\nrestrict, forgo, or limit the exercise of\nrights (including transferring, outsourcing,\nor limiting voting rights or forgoing the\nright to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in\nits sole discretion, deems it appropriate in\nlight of potential regulatory or other\nrestrictions on ownership or other\nconsequences resulting from reaching\ninvestment thresholds. These types of\nrestrictions could negatively impact a\nclient\u2019s performance or ability to meet its\ninvestment objective. When BlackRock or a\nBlackRock client is subject to an ownership\nlimitation, BlackRock may in its discretion\nseek permission from the applicable issuers or\nregulators to exceed the limitation. However,\nthere is no guarantee that permission will be\ngranted, or that, once granted, it will not be\nmodified or revoked at a later date with\nminimal or no notice. The issuer and/or\nregulator may also require that BlackRock on\nbehalf of itself and its clients take or\nrefrain from taking certain actions in\nconnection with the approval, order, consent,\nrelief or non-disapproval, which BlackRock may\naccept if it believes the benefits outweigh\nthe costs and may limit BlackRock from taking\nactions that it otherwise would take. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients, taking into\nconsideration benchmark weight and investment\nstrategy. BlackRock may adopt certain controls\ndesigned to prevent the occurrence of a breach\nof any applicable ownership threshold or\nlimits, including, for example, when ownership\nin certain securities nears an applicable\nthreshold, BlackRock may limit additional\npurchases in such securities or, with respect\nto ETFs, remove such securities from the list\nof Deposit Securities to be delivered to the\nFund in connection with purchases of Creation\nUnits of such Fund. If client holdings of an\nissuer exceed an applicable threshold and\nBlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable\nthe continued holding of such investments, it\nmay be necessary to reduce these positions to\nmeet the applicable limitations and BlackRock\nor such client may be subject to regulatory\nactions. In these cases, the investments will\nbe sold in a manner that BlackRock deems fair\nand equitable over time. Ownership limitations\nare highly complex. It is possible that,\ndespite BlackRock\u2019s intent to either comply\nwith or be granted permission to exceed\nownership limitations, it may inadvertently\nbreach a limit or violate the corporate or\nregulatory approval, order, consent, relief or\nnon-disapproval that was obtained. In addition\nto the foregoing, other ownership thresholds\nmay trigger reporting requirements to\ngovernmental and regulatory authorities, and\nsuch reports may entail the disclosure of the\nidentity of a client or BlackRock\u2019s intended\nstrategy with respect to such security or\nasset. BlackRock may not serve as an\nAuthorized Participant in the creation and\nredemption of iShares ETFs. Under an ETF\nServices Agreement, the Fund has, when\napplicable, retained BlackRock Investments,\nLLC (the \u201c Distributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an\nAffiliate of BFA, to perform certain order\nprocessing, Authorized Participant\ncommunications, and related services in\nconnection with the issuance and redemption of\nCreation Units of the Fund ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d\n). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard\ntransaction fee received from Authorized\nParticipants on each creation or redemption\norder from the Authorized Participant for the\nETF Services provided. BlackRock collaborated\nwith, and received payment from, Citibank,\nN.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d ) on the design and\ndevelopment of the ETF Services platform.\nCitibank may have, or from time to time may\ndevelop, additional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its\naffiliates. In order to defray transaction\nexpenses and protect against possible\nshareholder dilution, the Fund may collect\ncertain fees from Authorized Participants in\nconnection with cash substitutions for\ncreation and redemption transactions. While\nBlackRock uses good faith estimates of the\nexpected costs to the Fund in determining the\nrates for fees collected by the Fund related\nto creation and redemption activity, BlackRock\nmay have incentives to improve Fund\nperformance through the collection of these\nfees. As these charges are based on estimates,\nwhere the charges exceed actual transaction-\nrelated costs and/or expenses incurred by the\nFund, Fund performance could improve as a\nresult. BlackRock has established processes to\noversee the determination of these estimates\nin an effort to mitigate this conflict.\nBlackRock may maintain securities indices. To\nthe extent permitted by applicable laws, the\nFunds may seek to license and use such indices\nas part of their investment strategy. Index\nbased funds that seek to track the performance\nof securities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\n\n37\n\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Funds using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to a Fund\nand the Funds are under no obligation to use\nBlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a\nlicense for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to a Fund ( e.g ., custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to a\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Funds,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to a Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to a Fund, or the selection\nof such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/ or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by a Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Funds, that engage\nthe service provider (typically the\ncustodian). A Fund\u2019s service provider\nremunerates BlackRock for the use of the\nsystems. A Fund service provider\u2019s payments to\nBlackRock for the use of these systems may\nenhance the profitability of BlackRock.\nBlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a service\nprovider in connection with the use of systems\nprovided by BlackRock may create an incentive\nfor BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider. In recognition of a BlackRock\nclient\u2019s overall relationship with BlackRock,\nBlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not affect Fund fees and\nexpenses applicable to such client\u2019s\ninvestment in a Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock and its directors,\nofficers and employees, in addition to those\ndescribed in this section, may give rise to\nadditional conflicts of interest. Investment\nAdvisory, Administrative and Distribution\nServices Investment Adviser. BFA serves as\ninvestment adviser to the Fund pursuant to an\ninvestment advisory agreement between the\nTrust, on behalf of the Fund, and BFA. BFA is\na California corporation indirectly owned by\nBlackRock, Inc. and is registered as an\ninvestment adviser under the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the\ninvestment advisory agreement, BFA, subject to\nthe supervision of the Board and in conformity\nwith the stated investment policies of the\nFund, manages and administers the Trust and\nthe investment of the Fund\u2019s assets. BFA is\nresponsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the investment advisory agreement, BFA may,\nfrom time to time, in its sole discretion and\nto the extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to the Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law.\n\n38\n\nBFA is responsible, under the investment\nadvisory agreement, for substantially all\nexpenses of the Fund, including the cost of\ntransfer agency, custody, fund administration,\nlegal, audit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Fund will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees). BFA may from time to time\nvoluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary\nwaiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by\nBFA at any time. For its investment advisory\nservices to the Fund, BFA will be paid a\nmanagement fee by the Fund, as a percentage of\nthe Fund\u2019s average daily net assets, at an\nannual rate of 0.07%. BFA has contractually\nagreed to waive a portion of its management\nfees in an amount equal to Acquired Fund Fees\nand Expenses, if any, attributable to\ninvestments by the Fund in other funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates through the\ntermination date of the Fund, on or about\nDecember 15, 2055. The contractual waiver may\nbe terminated prior to the Fund\u2019s termination\nonly upon written agreement of the Trust and\nBFA. The investment advisory agreement with\nrespect to the Fund continues in effect for\ntwo years from its effective date, and\nthereafter is subject to annual approval by\n(i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of a majority\nof the outstanding voting securities (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund, provided\nthat in either event such continuance also is\napproved by a majority of the Board members\nwho are not interested persons (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the Fund, by a vote cast in\nperson at a meeting called for the purpose of\nvoting on such approval. The investment\nadvisory agreement with respect to the Fund is\nterminable without penalty, on 60 days\u2019\nnotice, by the Board or by a vote of the\nholders of a majority of the Fund\u2019s\noutstanding voting securities (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act). The investment advisory\nagreement is also terminable upon 60 days\u2019\nnotice by BFA and will terminate automatically\nin the event of its assignment (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act). Portfolio Managers. As of\nOctober 31, 2024, the individuals named as\nPortfolio Managers in the Fund's Prospectus\nwere also primarily responsible for the day-\nto-day management of other iShares funds and\ncertain other types of portfolios and/or\naccounts as follows:\n                                              \n  James Mauro                                 \n  Types of          Number      Total Assets  \n  Accounts                                    \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment           134  $728,686,000,000  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment            17    42,045,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts         5     3,776,000,000  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Karen Uyehara                               \n  Types of          Number      Total Assets  \n  Accounts                                    \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment           125  $716,293,000,000  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment             8       175,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts         2     2,596,000,000  \n                                              \nPursuant to BFA policy, investment\nopportunities are allocated equitably among\nthe Fund and other portfolios and accounts.\nFor example, under certain circumstances, an\ninvestment opportunity may be restricted due\nto limited supply in the market, legal\nconstraints or other factors, in which event\nthe investment opportunity will be allocated\nequitably among those portfolios and accounts,\nincluding the Fund, seeking such investment\nopportunity. As a consequence, from time to\ntime the Fund may receive a smaller allocation\nof an investment opportunity than it would\nhave if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its\naffiliates did not manage other portfolios or\naccounts. Like the Fund, the other portfolios\nor accounts for which the Portfolio Managers\nare primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management generally pay an asset-\nbased fee to BFA or its affiliates, as\napplicable, for its advisory services. One or\nmore of those other portfolios or accounts,\nhowever, may pay BFA or its affiliates a\nperformance-based fee in lieu of, or in\naddition to, an asset-based fee for its\nadvisory services. A portfolio or account with\na performance-based fee would pay BFA or its\naffiliates a portion of that portfolio's or\naccount's gains, or would pay BFA or its\naffiliates more for its services than\n\n39\n\nwould otherwise be the case if BFA or its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and its affiliates\nhave an obligation to allocate resources and\nopportunities equitably among portfolios and\naccounts and intend to do so, shareholders of\nthe Fund should be aware that, as with any\ngroup of portfolios and accounts managed by an\ninvestment adviser and/or its affiliates\npursuant to varying fee arrangements,\nincluding performance-based fee arrangements,\nthere is the potential for a conflict of\ninterest, which may result in the Portfolio\nManagers' favoring those portfolios or\naccounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below show, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of October 31, 2024:\n                                              \n  James Mauro                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts         Managed by  Total Assets   \n                    Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Karen                                       \n  Uyehara                                     \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts         Managed by   Total Assets  \n                    Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                2   $141,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1    661,000,000  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of March 21, 2025.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its underlying index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance. The discretionary\nincentive income for James Mauro and Karen\nUyehara includes as an additional\nconsideration the performance of actively-\nmanaged portfolios they manage over 1, 3 and 5\nyear periods measured against the respective\nbenchmark of each portfolio as well as peer\ngroup performance. A portion of the\ndiscretionary incentive compensation for James\nMauro and Karen Uyehara is distributed in the\nform of deferred cash awards that notionally\ntrack the returns of select BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestment products they manage, which\nprovides direct alignment of portfolio manager\ndiscretionary\n\n40\n\nincentive compensation with investment product\nresults. Deferred cash awards vest ratably\nover a number of years and, once vested,\nsettle in the form of cash. As of March 21,\n2025, the Portfolio Managers did not\nbeneficially own shares of the Fund. Codes of\nEthics. The Trust, BFA and the Distributor\nhave adopted codes of ethics pursuant to Rule\n17j-1 under the 1940 Act. The codes of ethics\npermit personnel subject to the codes of\nethics to invest in securities, subject to\ncertain limitations, including securities that\nmay be purchased or held by the Fund. Each\ncode of ethics is available by contacting\nBlackRock at the telephone number on the back\ncover of the Fund\u2019s Prospectus or by accessing\nthe EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site\nat http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. Anti-Money\nLaundering Requirements. The Fund is subject\nto the USA PATRIOT Act (the \u201c Patriot Act \u201d ).\nThe Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use\nof the U.S. financial system in furtherance of\nmoney laundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Pursuant to requirements under the\nPatriot Act, the Fund may request information\nfrom Authorized Participants to enable it to\nform a reasonable belief that it knows the\ntrue identity of its Authorized Participants.\nThis information will be used to verify the\nidentity of Authorized Participants or, in\nsome cases, the status of financial\nprofessionals; it will be used only for\ncompliance with the requirements of the\nPatriot Act. The Fund reserves the right to\nreject purchase orders from persons who have\nnot submitted information sufficient to allow\nthe Fund to verify their identity. The Fund\nalso reserves the right to redeem any amounts\nin the Fund from persons whose identity it is\nunable to verify on a timely basis. It is the\nFund's policy to cooperate fully with\nappropriate regulators in any investigations\nconducted with respect to potential money\nlaundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Administrator, Custodian and\nTransfer Agent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( \u201c\nJPMorgan \u201d ) serves as administrator,\ncustodian and transfer agent for the Fund\nunder the Master Services Agreement (the \u201c\nMaster Services Agreement \u201d ). JPMorgan\u2019s\nprincipal address is 383 Madison Avenue, 11 th\nFloor, New York, NY 10179. Pursuant to the\nMaster Services Agreement with the Trust,\nJPMorgan provides necessary administrative,\ntax and accounting and financial reporting\nservices for the maintenance and operations of\nthe Trust and the Fund. In addition, JPMorgan\nmakes available the office space, equipment,\npersonnel and facilities required to provide\nsuch services. Pursuant to the Master Services\nAgreement with the Trust, JPMorgan maintains,\nin separate accounts, cash, securities and\nother assets of the Trust and the Fund, keeps\nall necessary accounts and records and\nprovides other services. JPMorgan is required,\nupon the order of the Trust, to deliver\nsecurities held by JPMorgan and to make\npayments for securities purchased by the Trust\nfor the Fund. JPMorgan is authorized to\nappoint certain foreign custodians or foreign\ncustody managers for Fund investments outside\nthe U.S. Pursuant to the Master Services\nAgreement with the Trust, JPMorgan acts as a\ntransfer agent for the Fund\u2019s authorized and\nissued shares of beneficial interest, and as\ndividend disbursing agent of the Trust. As\ncompensation for these services, JPMorgan\nreceives certain out-of-pocket costs,\ntransaction fees and asset-based fees which\nare accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA from\nits management fee. BFA pays the compensation\nbecause it has agreed to pay these operating\nexpenses under the Investment Advisory\nAgreement as described therein. Distributor.\nThe Distributor's principal address is 50\nHudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. Shares are\ncontinuously offered for sale by the Fund\nthrough the Distributor or its agent only in\nCreation Units, as described in the Prospectus\nand below in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI. Fund\nshares in amounts less than Creation Units are\ngenerally not distributed by the Distributor\nor its agent. The Distributor or its agent\nwill arrange for the delivery of the\nProspectus and, upon request, this SAI to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nor its agents and confirmations of acceptance\nfurnished by it or its agents. The Distributor\nis a broker-dealer registered under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.\n( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor is also\nlicensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S.\nstates, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands and the District of Columbia.\nThe Distribution Agreement for the Fund\nprovides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii)\nthe vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the Fund. The Distribution Agreement will\nterminate automatically in the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).\n\n41\n\nThe Distributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers\n\u201d ) who will solicit purchases of Creation\nUnits of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers\nmay also be Authorized Participants (as\ndescribed below), Depository Trust Company ( \u201c\nDTC \u201d ) participants and/or investor services\norganizations. BFA or its affiliates may, from\ntime to time and from its own resources, pay,\ndefray or absorb costs relating to\ndistribution, including payments out of its\nown resources to the Distributor, or to\notherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that the\nFund engages in securities lending, the Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund, subject\nto the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to\na written agreement (the \u201c Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement \u201d ). The Fund retains a\nportion of the securities lending income and\nremits the remaining portion to BTC as\ncompensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Securities lending income is\ngenerally equal to the total of income earned\nfrom the reinvestment of cash collateral (and\nexcludes collateral investment fees as defined\nbelow), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. As securities\nlending agent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending. The\nFund is responsible for fees in connection\nwith the investment of cash collateral\nreceived for securities on loan in a money\nmarket fund managed by BFA (the \u201c collateral\ninvestment fees \u201d ); however, BTC has agreed\nto reduce the amount of securities lending\nincome it receives in order to effectively\nlimit the collateral investment fees the Fund\nbears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money\nmarket fund shares will not be subject to a\nsales load, redemption fee, distribution fee\nor service fee. To the extent that a Fund\ninvests cash collateral in a non-government\nmoney market fund, the Fund may be subject to\na discretionary liquidity fee of up to 2% on\nall redemptions. Discretionary liquidity fees\nmay be imposed or terminated at any time at\nthe discretion of the board of directors of\nthe money market fund, or its delegate, if it\nis determined that such fee would be, or would\nnot be, respectively, in the best interest of\nthe money market fund. Additionally, a Fund\nwill be subject to a mandatory liquidity fee\nif the money market fund's total net\nredemptions on a single day exceed 5% of the\nmoney market fund's net assets, unless the\nliquidity costs are de minimis ( i.e ., less\nthan one basis point (0.01%)). The money\nmarket fund will determine the size of the\nmandatory liquidity fee by making a good faith\nestimate of certain costs the money market\nfund would incur if it were to sell a pro rata\namount of each security in the portfolio to\nsatisfy the amount of net redemptions on that\nday. There is no limit to the size of a\nmandatory liquidity fee. If the money market\nfund cannot estimate the costs of selling a\npro rata amount of each portfolio security in\ngood faith and supported by data, it is\nrequired to apply a default liquidity fee of\n1% on the value of shares redeemed on that\nday. The imposition of any such discretionary\nor mandatory liquidity fee would reduce the\nFund's returns on securities lending. Under\nthe securities lending program, the Fund is\ncategorized into one of several specific asset\nclasses. The determination of the Fund\u2019s asset\nclass category (fixed-income, domestic equity,\ninternational equity or fund-of-funds), each\nof which may be subject to a different fee\narrangement, is based on a methodology agreed\nto by the Trust and BTC. Pursuant to the\ncurrent Securities Lending Agency Agreement:\n(i) fixed-income funds, such as the Fund,\nretain 82% of securities lending income (which\nexcludes collateral investment fees), and (ii)\nthis amount can never be less than 70% of the\nsum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees. In addition,\ncommencing the business day following the date\nthat the aggregate securities lending income\n(which includes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the iShares\nComplex (as defined in the Management \u2014\nTrustees and Officers section of this SAI) in\na calendar year exceeds specified thresholds,\neach applicable fixed-income fund, pursuant to\nthe current Securities Lending Agency\nAgreement, will receive for the remainder of\nthat calendar year securities lending income\nas follows: (i) 85% of securities lending\nincome (which excludes collateral investment\nfees) and (ii) this amount can never be less\nthan 70% of the sum of securities lending\nincome plus collateral investment fees.\nBecause the Fund is newly launched, no\nservices have been provided by BTC as the\nFund\u2019s securities lending agent, and the Fund\nhad no income and fees/compensation related to\nsecurities lending activities for the fiscal\nyear ended October 31, 2024.\n\n42\n\nPayments by BFA and its Affiliates. BFA and/or\nits affiliates ( \u201c BFA Entities \u201d ) pay\ncertain broker-dealers, registered investment\nadvisers, banks and other financial\nintermediaries ( \u201c Intermediaries \u201d ) for\ncertain activities related to the Fund and\nother funds or products sponsored and/or\nadvised by BFA Entities (collectively for\npurposes of this section, the \u201c Products \u201d ).\nBFA Entities make these payments from their\nown assets and not from the assets of the\nFund. Although a portion of BFA Entities\u2019\nrevenue comes directly or indirectly in part\nfrom fees paid by the Fund or other Products\n(including, if applicable, any underlying\nProducts held by the Fund), these payments do\nnot increase the price paid by investors for\nthe purchase of shares of, or the cost of\nowning, the Fund or other Products. BFA\nEntities make payments for Intermediaries\u2019\nparticipation in activities that are designed\nto make registered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Fund and other Products, or for\nother activities, such as participation in\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Fund or\nother Products ( \u201c Publishing Costs \u201d ). In\naddition, BFA Entities make payments to\nIntermediaries that make shares of the Fund or\nother Products available to their clients, in\nsome cases at a waived or reduced commission\nrate or ticket charge, develop new products\nthat feature iShares, create educational\ncontent about the Fund or other Products that\nis featured on an Intermediary\u2019s platform, or\notherwise promote the Fund or other Products.\nBFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or\nmake payments from their own assets to\nIntermediaries or other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\nbusiness of the BFA Entities or facilitate\ninvestment in the Fund or other Products.\nPayments of the type described above are\nsometimes referred to as revenue-sharing\npayments. Payments to an Intermediary may be\nsignificant to the Intermediary, and amounts\nthat Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or\nother investment professional may also be\nsignificant for your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional. Because an\nIntermediary may make decisions about which\ninvestment options it will recommend or make\navailable to its clients, what services to\nprovide for various products or what marketing\ncontent to make available to its clients based\non payments it receives or is eligible to\nreceive, such payments may create conflicts of\ninterest between the Intermediary and its\nclients. These financial incentives may cause\nthe Intermediary to recommend the Fund or\nother Products or otherwise promote the Fund\nor other Products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm. In addition to\nthe payments described above, BFA Entities\nhave developed proprietary tools, calculators\nand related interactive or digital content\nthat is made available through the\nwww.blackrock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Fund or other\nProducts. As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities\nhave contractual arrangements to make payments\n(in addition to payments for Education Costs\nor Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary,\nFidelity Brokerage Services LLC ( \u201c FBS \u201d ).\nEffective June 4, 2016, this relationship was\nexpanded to include National Financial\nServices, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an affiliate of\nFBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and\nsignificant arrangement (the \u201c Marketing\nProgram \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of their\naffiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d ) have\nagreed, among other things, to actively\npromote certain funds and Products to\ncustomers, investment professionals and other\nintermediaries and in advertising campaigns as\nthe preferred exchange-traded product, to\noffer certain funds and Products in certain\nFidelity platforms and investment programs, in\nsome cases at a waived or reduced commission\nrate or ticket charge, and to provide\nmarketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities\nhave agreed to facilitate the Marketing\nProgram by, among other things, making certain\npayments to FBS and NFS for marketing and\nimplementing certain brokerage and investment\nprograms. Upon termination of the arrangement,\nthe BFA Entities will make additional payments\nto FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of\ncriteria, including the overall success of the\nMarketing Program and the level of services\nprovided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down\nperiod. In addition, BFA Entities have entered\ninto other contractual arrangements with\nIntermediaries and certain other third parties\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\nbusiness of the BFA Entities or facilitate\ninvestment in the Fund or certain Products.\nSuch agreements can include payments by BFA\nEntities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. In certain cases, such\npayments to Intermediaries are subject to\ncertain minimum payment levels or tiered\npayments. With respect to certain funds and\nProducts, payments by the BFA Entities may\ntake the form of, among other things, \u201c due\ndiligence \u201d payments for an Intermediary\u2019s\nreview of such funds and Products; payment for\nproviding employee training and information\nrelating to such funds and Products; fees for\naccess (in some cases on a preferential basis)\nto an Intermediary\u2019s\n\n43\n\nregistered representatives, salespersons or\nother personnel, fees for maintaining an\nIntermediary\u2019s investor platform, \u201c shelf\nspace \u201d payments for making such funds and\nProducts available on the Intermediary\u2019s\nplatform or fees for providing assistance in\npromoting the sale of such funds and Products.\nIn such cases, the payments to Intermediaries\nmay be tiered or based on a percentage of the\nvalue of the funds and Products held by\ncustomers of the applicable Intermediary and\nmay also be subject to minimum payment levels.\nPayments made pursuant to such arrangements\nmay vary in any year and may be different for\ndifferent Intermediaries and third parties and\nmay reflect different services provided. As of\nthe date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and\nother third parties (or their respective\naffiliates) receiving one or more types of the\ncontractual payments described above include\n(in addition to FBS and NFS): &Partners,\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, AE Wealth Management,\nLLC, American Enterprise Investment Services,\nInc., Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY\nMellon Capital Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon\nPerformance & Risk Analytics, LLC, Cetera\nFinancial Group, Inc., Charles Schwab & Co.,\nInc., Clearstream Fund Centre AG, Commonwealth\nEquity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and\nAssociates, LLC, Dynasty Financial Partners\nLLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset\nManagement, Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill\nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated,\nMML Investors Services, LLC, Morgan Stanley\nSmith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual\nInvestment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio\nSolutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Raymond James\nFinancial Services, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc.,\nSanctuary Wealth Group, LLC, TD Ameritrade,\nInc., UBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo\nAdvisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\nProducts, including the Fund, in a year or\nother period, any of which arrangements may\ninclude an agreed-upon minimum or maximum\npayment, or any combination of the foregoing.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Fund or other Products. The Fund\nmay participate in certain market maker\nincentive programs of a national securities\nexchange in which an affiliate of the Fund\nwould pay a fee to the exchange used for the\npurpose of incentivizing one or more market\nmakers in the securities of the Fund to\nenhance the liquidity and quality of the\nsecondary market of securities of the Fund.\nThe fee would then be credited by the exchange\nto one or more market makers that meet or\nexceed liquidity and market quality standards\nwith respect to the securities of the Fund.\nEach market maker incentive program is subject\nto approval from the SEC. Any such fee\npayments made to an exchange will be made by\nan affiliate of the Fund solely for the\nbenefit of the Fund and will not be paid from\nany Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA\nmay also participate in such programs.\nDetermination of Net Asset Value Valuation of\nShares. The NAV for the Fund is generally\ncalculated as of the close of regular trading\nhours on the New York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE\n\u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each\nbusiness day the NYSE is open. Valuation of\nassets held by the Fund is as follows: Equity\nInvestments. Equity securities traded on a\nrecognized securities exchange ( e.g. , NYSE),\non separate trading boards of a securities\nexchange or through a market system that\nprovides contemporaneous transaction pricing\ninformation (each an \u201c Exchange \u201d ) are valued\nusing information obtained via independent\npricing services, generally at the closing\nprice or, if an Exchange closing price is not\navailable, the last traded price on that\nExchange prior to the time as of which the\nassets or liabilities are valued. However,\nunder certain circumstances, other means of\ndetermining current market value may be used.\nIf an equity security is traded on more than\none Exchange, the current market value of the\nsecurity where it is primarily traded\ngenerally will be used. In the event that\nthere are no sales involving an equity\nsecurity held by the Fund on a day on which\nthe Fund values such security, the prior day\u2019s\nprice will be used, unless BFA determines that\nsuch prior day\u2019s price no longer reflects the\nfair value of the security, in which case such\nasset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset\n(as defined below). Fixed-Income Investments.\nFixed-income securities for which market\nquotations are readily available are generally\nvalued using such securities\u2019 current market\nvalue. The Fund values fixed-income portfolio\nsecurities using the last available bid prices\nor current market quotations provided by\ndealers or prices (including evaluated prices)\nsupplied by the Fund\u2019s\n\n44\n\napproved independent third-party pricing\nservices, each in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. The pricing services may\nuse matrix pricing or valuation models that\nutilize certain inputs and assumptions to\nderive values, including transaction data (\ne.g ., recent representative bids and offers),\ncredit quality information, perceived market\nmovements, news, and other relevant\ninformation and by other methods, which may\ninclude consideration of: yields or prices of\nsecurities of comparable quality, coupon,\nmaturity and type; indications as to values\nfrom dealers; general market conditions;\nand/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing\nservices generally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly transactions of an\ninstitutional round lot size, but the Fund may\nhold or transact in such securities in\nsmaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at\nlower prices than institutional round lots.\nThe amortized cost method of valuation may be\nused with respect to debt obligations with 60\ndays or less remaining to maturity unless such\nmethod does not represent fair value. Certain\nfixed-income investments, including asset-\nbacked and mortgage-related securities, may be\nvalued based on valuation models that consider\nthe estimated cash flows of each tranche of\nthe issuer, establish a benchmark yield and\ndevelop an estimated tranche-specific spread\nto the benchmark yield based on the unique\nattributes of the tranche. Options, Futures,\nSwaps and Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded\nequity options (except those that are\ncustomized) for which market quotations are\nreadily available are valued at the mean of\nthe last bid and ask prices as quoted on the\nExchange or the board of trade on which such\noptions are traded. In the event that there is\nno mean price available for an exchange traded\nequity option held by the Fund on a day on\nwhich the Fund values such option, the last\nbid (long positions) or ask (short positions)\nprice, if available, will be used as the value\nof such option. If no bid or ask price is\navailable on a day on which the Fund values\nsuch option, the prior day\u2019s price will be\nused, unless BFA determines that such prior\nday\u2019s price no longer reflects the fair value\nof the option, in which case such option will\nbe treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined\nbelow). Customized exchange-traded equity\noptions, as well as OTC derivatives, may be\nvalued using a mathematical model which may\nincorporate a number of market data factors.\nFinancial futures contracts and options\nthereon, which are traded on exchanges, are\nvalued at their last sale price or settle\nprice as of the close of such exchanges. Swap\nagreements and other derivatives are generally\nvalued daily based upon quotations from market\nmakers or by a pricing service in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Underlying\nFunds. Shares of underlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds) are valued at\nNAV. Shares of underlying exchange-traded\nclosed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued\nat their most recent closing price. General\nValuation Information. Prices obtained from\nindependent third-party pricing services,\nbroker-dealers or market makers to value the\nFund\u2019s securities and other assets and\nliabilities are based on information available\nat the time the Fund values its assets and\nliabilities. In the event that a pricing\nservice quotation is revised or updated\nsubsequent to the day on which the Fund valued\nsuch security, the revised pricing service\nquotation generally will be applied\nprospectively. Such determination will be made\nconsidering pertinent facts and circumstances\nsurrounding the revision. The price the Fund\ncould receive upon the sale of any particular\nportfolio investment may differ from the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for assets that trade in thin or\nvolatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation methodology or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. As a\nresult, the price received upon the sale of an\ninvestment may be less than the value ascribed\nby the Fund, and the Fund could realize a\ngreater than expected loss or lesser than\nexpected gain upon the sale of the investment.\nThe Fund\u2019s ability to value its investment may\nalso be impacted by technological issues\nand/or errors by pricing services or other\nthird-party service providers. All cash,\nreceivables and current payables are carried\non the Fund\u2019s books at their fair value. In\nthe event that application of the methods of\nvaluation discussed above result in a price\nfor a security which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, the Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by the Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. Use of\nfair value prices and certain current market\nvaluations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate the\nFund\u2019s NAV and the prices used in the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn, could result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the Underlying Index.\nFair Value. When market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation\n\n45\n\nProcedures. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the\nInvestment Company Act, the Board of Trustees\nhas designated BFA as the valuation designee\nfor the respective Funds for which it serves\nas investment adviser. BFA may reasonably\nconclude that a market quotation is not\nreadily available or is unreliable if, among\nother things, a security or other asset or\nliability does not have a price source due to\nits complete lack of trading, if BFA believes\na market quotation from a broker-dealer or\nother source is unreliable ( e.g. , where it\nvaries significantly from a recent trade, or\nno longer reflects the fair value of the\nsecurity or other asset or liability\nsubsequent to the most recent market\nquotation), or where the security or other\nasset or liability is only thinly traded or\ndue to the occurrence of a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent market\nquotation. For this purpose, a \u201c significant\nevent \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA determines,\nin its reasonable business judgment, that an\nevent has occurred after the close of trading\nfor an asset or liability but prior to or at\nthe time of pricing the Fund\u2019s assets or\nliabilities, is likely to cause a material\nchange to the last exchange closing price or\nclosing market price of one or more assets\nheld by, or liabilities of, the Fund. On any\nday the NYSE is open and a foreign market or\nthe primary exchange on which a foreign asset\nor liability is traded is closed, such asset\nor liability will be valued using the prior\nday\u2019s price, provided that BFA is not aware of\nany significant event or other information\nthat would cause such price to no longer\nreflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition,\nthe Fund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of the Fund. The pricing of all\nFair Value Assets is subsequently reported to\nthe Board or a committee thereof. When\ndetermining the price for a Fair Value Asset,\nBFA will seek to determine the price that the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive from\nthe current sale of that asset or liability in\nan arm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on\nwhich the asset or liability is being valued,\nand does not seek to determine the price the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive for\nselling an asset or liability at a later time\nor if it holds the asset or liability to\nmaturity. Fair value determinations will be\nbased upon all available factors that BFA\ndeems relevant at the time of the\ndetermination, and may be based on analytical\nvalues determined by BFA using proprietary or\nthird-party valuation models. Fair value\nrepresents a good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset or liability. When\ndetermining the fair value of an investment,\none or more fair value methodologies may be\nused (depending on certain factors, including\nthe asset type). For example, the investment\nmay be initially priced based on the original\ncost of the investment or, alternatively,\nusing proprietary or third-party models that\nmay rely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nThe Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect\nthe Fund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to the Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value.\n\n46\n\nBrokerage Transactions Subject to policies\nestablished by the Board, BFA is primarily\nresponsible for the execution of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio transactions and the allocation of\nbrokerage. BFA does not execute transactions\nthrough any particular broker or dealer, but\nseeks to obtain the best net results for the\nFund, taking into account such factors as\nprice (including the applicable brokerage\ncommission or dealer spread), size of order,\ndifficulty of execution, operational\nfacilities of the firm and the firm\u2019s risk and\nskill in positioning blocks of securities.\nWhile BFA generally seeks reasonable trade\nexecution costs, the Fund does not necessarily\npay the lowest spread or commission available,\nand payment of the lowest commission or spread\nis not necessarily consistent with obtaining\nthe best price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including the\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause the Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for the Fund and may take into\naccount a variety of factors including: (i)\nthe size, nature and character of the security\nor instrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time,\nthe Fund may purchase new issues of securities\nin a fixed price offering. In these\nsituations, the broker may be a member of the\nselling group that will, in addition to\nselling securities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). OTC\nissues, including most fixed-income securities\nsuch as corporate debt and U.S. Government\nsecurities, are normally traded on a \u201c net \u201d\nbasis without a stated commission, through\ndealers acting for their own account and not\nas brokers. The Fund will primarily engage in\ntransactions with these dealers or deal\ndirectly with the issuer unless a better price\nor execution could be obtained by using a\nbroker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit. Under the 1940\nAct, persons affiliated with the Fund and\npersons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the dealers\nacting as principal for their own accounts,\nthe Fund will not deal with affiliated persons\nand affiliated persons of such affiliated\npersons in connection with such transactions.\nThe Fund will not purchase securities during\nthe existence of any underwriting or selling\ngroup relating to such securities of which\nBFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined\nin the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except\npursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in\naccordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.\nPurchases of money market instruments by the\nFund are made from dealers, underwriters and\nissuers. The Fund does not currently expect to\nincur any brokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer.\n\n47\n\nBFA may, from time to time, effect trades on\nbehalf of and for the account of the Fund with\nbrokers or dealers that are affiliated with\nBFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the\n1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under\nthese provisions, any commissions paid to\naffiliated brokers or dealers must be\nreasonable and fair compared to the\ncommissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. Securities\npurchased in underwritten offerings include a\nfixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Fund\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Fund may invest. Initial public\nofferings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of securities may be\nover-subscribed and subsequently trade at a\npremium in the secondary market. When BFA is\ngiven an opportunity to invest in such an\ninitial offering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue,\nthe supply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in the Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well. Because different\naccounts may have differing investment\nobjectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell\nthe same securities at the same time for\ndifferent clients based on the particular\ninvestment objective, guidelines and\nstrategies of those accounts. For example, BFA\nmay decide that it may be entirely appropriate\nfor a growth fund to sell a security at the\nsame time a value fund is buying that\nsecurity. To the extent that transactions on\nbehalf of more than one client of BFA or the\nother Affiliates during the same period\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, there may be an adverse effect on price.\nFor example, sales of a security by BlackRock\non behalf of one or more of its clients may\ndecrease the market price of such security,\nadversely impacting other BlackRock clients\nthat still hold the security. If purchases or\nsales of securities arise for consideration at\nor about the same time that would involve the\nFund or other clients or funds for which BFA\nor another Affiliate act as investment\nmanager, transactions in such securities will\nbe made, insofar as feasible, for the\nrespective funds and clients in a manner\ndeemed equitable to all. In certain instances,\nBFA may find it efficient for purposes of\nseeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate\nor \u201c bunch \u201d certain contemporaneous purchases\nor sale orders of its advisory accounts and\nadvisory accounts of affiliates. In general,\nall contemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a\n\n48\n\nmore favorable execution at a potentially\nlower execution cost. The costs associated\nwith a bunched order will be shared pro rata\namong the clients in the bunched order.\nGenerally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Fund is concerned,\nin other cases it could be beneficial to the\nFund. Transactions effected by BFA or the\nother Affiliates on behalf of more than one of\nits clients during the same period may\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, causing an adverse effect on price. The\ntrader will give the bunched order to the\nbroker-dealer that the trader has identified\nas being able to provide the best execution of\nthe order. Orders for purchase or sale of\nsecurities will be placed within a reasonable\namount of time of the order receipt and\nbunched orders will be kept bunched only long\nenough to execute the order. The Fund's\npurchase and sale orders for securities may be\ncombined with those of other investment\ncompanies, clients or accounts that BlackRock\nmanages or advises. If purchases or sales of\nportfolio securities of the Fund and one or\nmore other accounts managed or advised by\nBlackRock are considered at or about the same\ntime, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Fund and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Fund\nis concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFund. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for\nits own account in the types of securities in\nwhich the Fund may invest. BlackRock may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Fund\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses. Because the Fund\nis newly launched, there is no reportable\nportfolio turnover. Additional Information\nConcerning the Trust Shares. The Trust issues\nshares of beneficial interests in the funds\nwith no par value. The Board may designate\nadditional iShares funds. Each share issued by\na fund has a pro rata interest in the assets\nof that fund. Shares have no preemptive,\nexchange, subscription or conversion rights\nand are freely transferable. Each share is\nentitled to participate equally in dividends\nand distributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the relevant fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of such fund on\nliquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Following the creation of the\ninitial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund\nand immediately prior to the commencement of\ntrading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more\nthan 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject\nto the reporting provisions of Section 13 of\nthe 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In\n\n49\n\naddition, absent an applicable exemption or\nother relief from the SEC or its staff,\nofficers and trustees of a fund and beneficial\nowners of 10% of the shares of a fund ( \u201c\nInsiders \u201d ) may be subject to the insider\nreporting, short-swing profit and short sale\nprovisions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act and\nthe SEC\u2019s rules promulgated thereunder.\nBeneficial owners and Insiders should consult\nwith their own legal counsel concerning their\nobligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the\n1934 Act and existing guidance provided by the\nSEC staff. In accordance with the Trust's\ncurrent Agreement and Declaration of Trust\n(the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the Board\nmay, without shareholder approval (unless such\nshareholder approval is required by the\nDeclaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Fund. Shares of\nthe Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of the\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC\n\n50\n\nParticipants will be governed by standing\ninstructions and customary practices, as is\nnow the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in bearer form or\nregistered in a \u201c street name, \u201d and will be\nthe responsibility of such DTC Participants.\nThe Trust has no responsibility or liability\nfor any aspect of the records relating to or\nnotices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made\non account of beneficial ownership interests\nin such shares, or for maintaining,\nsupervising or reviewing any records relating\nto such beneficial ownership interests, or for\nany other aspect of the relationship between\nDTC and the DTC Participants or the\nrelationship between such DTC Participants and\nthe Indirect Participants and Beneficial\nOwners owning through such DTC Participants.\nDTC may decide to discontinue providing its\nservice with respect to shares of the Trust at\nany time by giving reasonable notice to the\nTrust and discharging its responsibilities\nwith respect thereto under applicable law.\nUnder such circumstances, the Trust shall take\naction to find a replacement for DTC to\nperform its functions at a comparable cost.\nDistribution of Shares. In connection with the\nFund's launch, the Fund will be seeded through\nthe sale of one or more Creation Units by the\nFund to one or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof the Fund or the Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor the Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nThe Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\nthe Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund's NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the Listing Exchange or the bond\nmarkets close earlier than normal, the Fund\nmay require orders to be placed earlier in the\nday. The following table sets forth the number\nof shares of the Fund that constitute a\nCreation Unit for the Fund and the approximate\nvalue of such Creation Unit as of March 21,\n2025:\n                                              \n  Shares PerCreation        ApproximateValue  \n  Unit                       PerCreationUnit  \n                                     (U.S.$)  \n  50,000                          $1,250,000  \n                                              \nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of\nthe Fund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation\nUnit. The Board reserves the right to declare\na split or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of the Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board. A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\nthe Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. The Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the\n\n51\n\nListing Exchange on which the Fund is listed\nfor trading is open for business. As of the\ndate of this SAI, the Listing Exchange\nobserves the following holidays, as observed:\nNew Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,\nJuneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Fund\nDeposit. The consideration for purchase of\nCreation Units of the Fund generally consists\nof Deposit Securities and the Cash Component\ncomputed as described below. Together, the\nDeposit Securities and the Cash Component\nconstitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d which, when\ncombined with the Fund's portfolio securities\nis designed to generate performance that has a\ncollective investment profile similar to that\nof the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent\ninvestment amount for a Creation Unit of the\nFund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject\nto any adjustments as described below, to\npurchases of Creation Units of shares of the\nFund until such time as the next-announced\nFund Deposit is made available. The Cash\nComponent is an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the NAV of the shares (per Creation\nUnit) and the \u201c Deposit Amount, \u201d which is an\namount equal to the market value of the\nDeposit Securities, and serves to compensate\nfor any differences between the NAV per\nCreation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment\nof any stamp duty or other similar fees and\nexpenses payable upon transfer of beneficial\nownership of the Deposit Securities are the\nsole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant purchasing the Creation Unit. As\nthe planned termination date of the Fund\napproaches, and particularly as the bonds held\nby the Fund begin to mature, the Fund expects\nto effect both creations and redemptions\nincreasingly for cash. The identity and number\nor par value of the Deposit Securities change\npursuant to changes in the composition of the\nFund's portfolio and as rebalancing\nadjustments and corporate action events are\nreflected from time to time by BFA with a view\nto the investment objective of the Fund. The\ncomposition of the Deposit Securities may also\nchange in response to adjustments to the\nweighting or composition of the component\nsecurities constituting the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund Deposit may also be modified to\nminimize the Cash Component by redistributing\nthe cash to the Deposit Securities portion of\nthe Fund Deposit through \u201c systematic\nrounding. \u201d The rounding methodology \u201c rounds\nup \u201d position sizes of securities in the\nDeposit Securities (which in turn reduces the\ncash portion). However, the methodology limits\nthe maximum allowed percentage change in\nweight and share quantity of any given\nsecurity in the Fund Deposit. Fund Deposits\nmay also be modified to position a fund\ntowards a forward index rebalance to reflect\nrevisions that account for index additions,\ndeletions, and re-weights. The Trust may, in\nits sole discretion, substitute a \u201c cash in\nlieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash\nComponent to replace any Deposit Security in\ncertain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by the Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit partial or full cash purchases of\nCreation Units of its funds, when partial or\nfull cash purchases of Creation Units are\navailable or specified for the Fund, they will\nbe effected in essentially the same manner as\nin-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a\npartial or full cash purchase, the Authorized\nParticipant must pay the cash equivalent of\nthe Deposit Securities it would otherwise be\nrequired to provide through an in-kind\npurchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Fund, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units is referred to as an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant. \u201d All shares of the\nFund, however created, will be entered on the\nrecords of DTC in the name of Cede & Co. for\nthe account of a DTC Participant.\n\n52\n\nRole of the Authorized Participant. Creation\nUnits may be purchased only by or through a\nmember or participant of a clearing agency\nregistered with the SEC, which has a written\nagreement with the Fund or one of its service\nproviders that allows such member or\nparticipant to place orders for the purchase\nand redemption of Creation Units. Such\nAuthorized Participant will agree, pursuant to\nthe terms of such Authorized Participant\nAgreement and on behalf of itself or any\ninvestor on whose behalf it will act, to\ncertain conditions, including that such\nAuthorized Participant will make available in\nadvance of each purchase of shares an amount\nof cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component,\nonce the NAV of a Creation Unit is next\ndetermined after receipt of the purchase order\nin proper form, together with the transaction\nfees described below. An Authorized\nParticipant, acting on behalf of an investor,\nmay require the investor to enter into an\nagreement with such Authorized Participant\nwith respect to certain matters, including\npayment of the Cash Component. Investors who\nare not Authorized Participants must make\nappropriate arrangements with an Authorized\nParticipant. Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not be a DTC\nParticipant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\nAuthorized Participant. As a result, purchase\norders placed through an Authorized\nParticipant may result in additional charges\nto such investor. The Trust does not expect to\nenter into an Authorized Participant Agreement\nwith more than a small number of DTC\nParticipants. A list of current Authorized\nParticipants may be obtained from the\nDistributor. The Distributor has adopted\nguidelines regarding Authorized Participants\u2019\ntransactions in Creation Units that are made\navailable to all Authorized Participants.\nThese guidelines set forth the processes and\nstandards for Authorized Participants to\ntransact with the Distributor and its agents\nin connection with creation and redemption\ntransactions. In addition, the Distributor may\nbe appointed as the proxy of the Authorized\nParticipant and may be granted a power of\nattorney under its Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Placement of Creation Orders. Fund\nDeposits must be delivered through the Federal\nReserve System (the \u201c Fed \u201d ) (for cash and\nU.S. government securities), through DTC (for\ncorporate and municipal securities) or through\na central depository account, such as with\nEuroclear or DTC, maintained by JPMorgan or a\nsub-custodian (a \u201c Central Depository Account\n\u201d ). Any portion of a Fund Deposit that may\nnot be delivered through the Fed or DTC must\nbe delivered through a Central Depository\nAccount. The Fund Deposit transfers made\nthrough DTC must be ordered by the DTC\nParticipant in a timely fashion so as to\nensure the delivery of the requisite number of\nDeposit Securities through DTC to the account\nof the Fund generally before 3:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund\nDeposit transfers made through the Fed must be\ndeposited by the participant institution in a\ntimely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of\nthe requisite number or amount of Deposit\nSecurities or cash through the Fed to the\naccount of the Fund generally before 3:00\np.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date.\nFund Deposit transfers made through a Central\nDepository Account must be completed pursuant\nto the requirements established by the\ncustodian or sub-custodian for such Central\nDepository Account generally before 2:00 p.m.,\nEastern time on the Settlement Date. The \u201c\nSettlement Date \u201d for all funds is generally\nthe second business day after the Transmittal\nDate. All questions as to the number of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered, and the\nvalidity, form and eligibility (including time\nof receipt) for the deposit of any tendered\nsecurities, will be determined by the Trust,\nwhose determination shall be final and\nbinding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash\nComponent must be transferred directly to\nJPMorgan through the Federal Reserve Bank wire\ntransfer system in a timely manner so as to be\nreceived by JPMorgan generally before 3:00\np.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. If\nthe Cash Component and the Deposit Securities\nare not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on\nthe Settlement Date, the creation order may be\ncanceled. Upon written notice to the\nDistributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using a\nFund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect\nthe then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery\nof Creation Units so created generally will\noccur no later than the second Business Day\nfollowing the day on which the purchase order\nis deemed received by the Distributor,\nprovided that the relevant Fund Deposit has\nbeen received by the Fund prior to such time.\nPurchase Orders. To initiate an order for a\nCreation Unit, an Authorized Participant must\nsubmit to the Distributor or its agent an\nirrevocable order to purchase shares of the\nFund, in proper form, generally before 4:00\np.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to\nreceive that day\u2019s NAV. The Distributor or its\nagent will notify BFA and the custodian of\nsuch order. The custodian will then provide\nsuch information to any appropriate sub-\ncustodian. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning the delivery of the Fund Deposit are\nset forth in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time. Investors, other than Authorized\nParticipants, are responsible for making\narrangements for a creation request to be made\nthrough an Authorized Participant. The\nDistributor or its agent will provide a list\nof current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFund, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Fund to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next\n\n53\n\ndetermined after acceptance of the purchase\norder, together with the applicable purchase\ntransaction fees. Those placing orders should\nascertain the deadline for cash transfers by\ncontacting the operations department of the\nbroker or depositary institution effectuating\nthe transfer of the Cash Component. This\ndeadline is likely to be significantly earlier\nthan the Cutoff Time of the Fund. Investors\nshould be aware that an Authorized Participant\nmay require orders for purchases of shares\nplaced with it to be in the particular form\nrequired by the individual Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant is\nresponsible for any and all expenses and costs\nincurred by the Fund, including any applicable\ncash amounts, in connection with any purchase\norder. Timing of Submission of Purchase\nOrders. An Authorized Participant must submit\nan irrevocable order to purchase shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Fund to the Distributor or its\nagent pursuant to procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Economic or\nmarket disruptions or changes, or telephone or\nother communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. The Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as the Fund's \u201c\nCutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with the\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Fund are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFund will accept the order, subject to the\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once the Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. The Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, the Fund may reject or revoke a\ncreation order transmitted to it by the\nDistributor or its agent if (i) the order is\nnot in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding shares of\nthe Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not conform to the identity and\nnumber of shares specified, as described\nabove; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit\nSecurities is not legally required or would,\nin the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; or (v)\ncircumstances outside the control of the Fund,\nthe Distributor or its agent and BFA make it\nimpracticable to process purchase orders. The\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a\nprospective purchaser of a Creation Unit\nand/or the Authorized Participant acting on\nbehalf of such purchaser of its rejection of\nsuch order. The Fund, JPMorgan, the sub-\ncustodian and the Distributor or its agent are\nunder no duty, however, to give notification\nof any defects or irregularities in the\ndelivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of\nthem incur any liability for failure to give\nsuch notification. Issuance of a Creation\nUnit. Except as provided herein, a Creation\nUnit will not be issued until the transfer of\ngood title to the Fund of the Deposit\nSecurities and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the sub-\ncustodian has confirmed to the custodian that\nthe securities included in the Fund Deposit\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant sub-\ncustodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor\nor its agent and BFA shall be notified of such\ndelivery and the Fund will issue and cause the\ndelivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units\nare generally issued on a \u201c T+1 basis \u201d (i.e.,\none Business Day after trade date). However,\nthe Fund reserves the right to settle Creation\nUnit transactions on a different basis, if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. These circumstances may include, among\nothers, accommodating non-U.S. market holiday\nschedules and accounting for different\ntreatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of\ndividend record dates and ex-dividend dates\n(i.e., the last day the holder of a security\ncan sell the security and still receive\ndividends payable on the security).\n\n54\n\nTo the extent contemplated by an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement with the Distributor,\nthe Fund will issue Creation Units to such\nAuthorized Participant, notwithstanding the\nfact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have\nnot been received in part or in whole, in\nreliance on the undertaking of the Authorized\nParticipant to deliver the missing Deposit\nSecurities as soon as possible, which\nundertaking shall be secured by such\nAuthorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\nbuy Deposit Securities for the Fund. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe contractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Fund's current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Fund to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Fund of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges. In certain cases,\nAuthorized Participants may create and redeem\nCreation Units on the same trade date and in\nthese instances, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by the\nFund and the Fund's determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the\nFund has retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA,\nto perform the ETF Services. BRIL will receive\nfrom an Authorized Participant a standard\ntransaction fee on each creation order, which\nconsists of (1) a fee for providing the ETF\nServices (the \u201c ETF Servicing Fee \u201d ) and (2)\ntransfer, processing and other transaction\ncosts charged by the Fund custodian in\nconnection with the issuance of Creation Units\nfor such creation order ( \u201c Custody\nTransaction Costs \u201d ). BRIL is entitled to\nretain the ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the\nETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will\nreimburse any Custody Transaction Costs to the\napplicable Fund custodian according to the\namounts invoiced by such custodian. The ETF\nServicing Fee is a flat fee per order\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing purchased, which amount will vary among\ndifferent Funds based on a number of factors,\nincluding the complexity of the order and the\ntypes of securities or instruments included in\nthe Fund\u2019s Creation Basket, among other\nvariables. The ETF Servicing Fee may be equal\nto zero in certain instances, such as for\ncreation transactions that consist solely of\ncash. The actual Custody Transaction Costs\nvary per order based on the number of trades,\nunderlying markets and settlement locations\nassociated with the issuance of a Creation\nUnit. The following table sets forth, for the\nFund, an estimate of the creation transaction\nfee for a Creation Unit based on data as of\nFebruary 10, 2025. The actual fee charged to\nan Authorized Participant in connection with a\ncreation order will vary over time depending\non the factors discussed above, and may be\nhigher than the fee set forth below. In order\nto defray transaction expenses for the Fund\nand protect against possible shareholder\ndilution, if a creation transaction consists\nsolely or partially of cash, the Authorized\nParticipant may also be required to cover (up\nto the maximum amount shown below) certain\nbrokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution\nand other costs and expenses related to the\nexecution of trades resulting from such\ntransaction (which may, in certain instances,\nbe based on a good faith estimate of\ntransaction costs based on historical data or\nother inputs, at BlackRock\u2019s discretion, and\nmay include part or all of the spread between\nthe expected bid and offer side of the market\nand anticipated market impact). However, the\nFund is not obligated to trade identical\nsecurities to the securities identified by\nBlackRock in estimating these transaction and\nother costs and expenses. In certain cases,\nBlackRock or an affiliate may determine in its\ndiscretion to deviate from the regular charge,\nsubject to the maximum amounts shown below.\nAuthorized Participants will also bear the\ncosts of transferring the Deposit Securities\nto the Fund. Certain fees/costs associated\nwith creation transactions may be waived in\ncertain circumstances. Investors who use the\nservices of a broker or other financial\nintermediary to acquire Fund shares may be\ncharged a fee for such services. The following\ntable sets forth the Fund's estimated creation\ntransaction fee based on data as of February\n10, 2025 and maximum additional charge (as\ndescribed above):\n\n55\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  CreationTransaction   AdditionalCharge*     \n  Fee                                         \n  $305.00**             3.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit. ** Estimated fee. Redemption of\nCreation Units. Shares of the Fund may be\nredeemed by Authorized Participants only in\nCreation Units at their NAV next determined\nafter receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form by the Distributor or its agent\nand only on a Business Day. The Fund will not\nredeem shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits. There can be no assurance, however,\nthat there will be sufficient liquidity in the\nsecondary market at any time to permit\nassembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should\nexpect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number\nof shares to constitute a Creation Unit that\ncould be redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant. Beneficial owners also may sell\nshares in the secondary market. The Fund\ngenerally redeems Creation Units for Fund\nSecurities (as defined below). Please see the\nCash Redemption Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the in-kind\nmethod for further information on redeeming\nCreation Units of the Fund. The Fund publishes\nthe designated portfolio of securities\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) that will be\napplicable to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day ( \u201c\nFund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption Basket \u201d ),\nand an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash Amount, \u201d as\ndescribed below) in order to effect\nredemptions of Creation Units of the Fund.\nSuch Fund Securities and Cash Amount will\nremain in effect until such time as the next\nannounced composition of the Fund Securities\nand Cash Amount is made available. The Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount are subject to\npossible amendment or correction. Fund\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Unless cash\nredemptions are available or specified for the\nFund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit generally consist of Fund Securities,\nplus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal\nto the difference between the NAV of the\nshares being redeemed, as next determined\nafter the receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form, and the value of Fund Securities,\nless a redemption transaction fee (as\ndescribed below). The Trust may, in its sole\ndiscretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. The Fund generally\nredeems Creation Units for Fund Securities,\nbut the Fund reserves the right to utilize a\ncash option for redemption of Creation Units.\nThe Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide\nsuch redeeming Authorized Participant a\nportfolio of securities that differs from the\nexact composition of the Fund Securities, but\ndoes not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket\nmay also be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index rebalance to reflect revisions\nthat account for index additions, deletions,\nand re-weights.\n\n56\n\nCash Redemption Method. Although the Trust\ndoes not generally permit partial or full cash\nredemptions of Creation Units of its funds,\nwhen partial or full cash redemptions of\nCreation Units are available or specified for\nthe Fund, they will be effected in essentially\nthe same manner as in-kind redemptions\nthereof. In the case of partial or full cash\nredemption, the Authorized Participant\nreceives the cash equivalent of the Fund\nSecurities it would otherwise receive through\nan in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash\nAmount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\nA standard redemption transaction fee is\nimposed to offset transfer and other\ntransaction costs that may be incurred by the\nFund. As described above, under an ETF\nServices Agreement, the Fund has retained\nBRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform certain\nETF Services. BRIL will receive from an\nAuthorized Participant a standard transaction\nfee on each redemption order, which consists\nof (1) the ETF Servicing Fee and (2) Custody\nTransaction Costs. BRIL is entitled to retain\nthe ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF\nServices Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse\nany Custody Transaction Costs to the\napplicable Fund custodian according to the\namounts invoiced by such custodian. The ETF\nServicing Fee is a flat fee per order\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing redeemed, which amount will vary among\ndifferent Funds based on a number of factors,\nincluding the complexity of the order and the\ntypes of securities or instruments included in\na Fund\u2019s Redemption Basket, among other\nvariables. The ETF Servicing Fee may be equal\nto zero in certain instances, such as for\nredemption transactions that consist solely of\ncash. The actual Custody Transaction Costs\nvary per order based on the number of trades,\nunderlying markets, and settlement locations\nassociated with the redemption of a Creation\nUnit. The following table sets forth an\nestimate of the redemption transaction fee for\na Creation Unit based on data as of February\n10, 2025. The actual fee charged to an\nAuthorized Participant in connection with a\nredemption order will vary over time depending\non the factors discussed above, and may be\nhigher than the fee set forth below. In order\nto defray transaction expenses for the Fund\nand protect against possible shareholder\ndilution, if a redemption transaction consists\nsolely or partially of cash, the Authorized\nParticipant may also be required to cover (up\nto the maximum amount shown below) certain\nbrokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution\nand other costs and expenses related to the\nexecution of trades resulting from such\ntransaction (which may, in certain instances,\nbe based on a good faith estimate of\ntransaction costs based on historical data or\nother inputs, at BlackRock\u2019s discretion, and\nmay include part or all of the spread between\nthe expected bid and offer side of the market\nand anticipated market impact). However, the\nFund is not obligated to trade identical\nsecurities to the securities identified by\nBlackRock in estimating these transaction and\nother costs and expenses. In certain cases,\nBlackRock or an affiliate may determine in its\ndiscretion to deviate from the regular charge,\nsubject to the maximum amounts shown below.\nAuthorized Participants will also bear the\ncosts of transferring the Fund Securities from\nthe Fund to their account on their order.\nCertain fees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\ndispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee\nfor such services. The following table sets\nforth the Fund's estimated redemption\ntransaction fee based on data as of February\n10, 2025 and maximum additional charge (as\ndescribed above):\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  RedemptionTransacti\u2026  AdditionalCharge*     \n  Fee                                         \n  $305.00**             2.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\nredemption transaction fee. ** Estimated fee.\nPlacement of Redemption Orders. Redemption\nrequests for Creation Units of the Fund must\nbe submitted to the Distributor or its agent\nby or through an Authorized Participant. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable request to redeem shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, the Fund may\nrequire orders to redeem Creation Units to be\nplaced earlier that day. Investors, other than\nAuthorized Participants, are responsible for\nmaking arrangements for a redemption request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. The Authorized Participant must\ntransmit the request for redemption in the\nform required by the Fund to the Distributor\nor its agent in accordance with procedures set\nforth in the Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors should be aware that their\n\n57\n\nparticular broker may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that,\ntherefore, requests to redeem Creation Units\nmay have to be placed by the investor's broker\nthrough an Authorized Participant who has\nexecuted an Authorized Participant Agreement.\nAt any time, only a limited number of broker-\ndealers will have an Authorized Participant\nAgreement in effect. Investors making a\nredemption request should be aware that such\nrequest must be in the form specified by such\nAuthorized Participant. Investors making a\nrequest to redeem Creation Units should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe request by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Fund's transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Fund's\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the Fund is\nreceived by the Distributor or its agent from\nthe Authorized Participant on behalf of itself\nor another redeeming investor within the time\nperiods specified above; and (iii) all other\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement are properly followed.\nUpon receiving a redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent shall notify the Fund\nand the Fund's transfer agent of such\nredemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds are generally made within one\nBusiness Day (i.e., \u201c T+1 \u201d ). However, the\nFund reserves the right to settle deliveries\nof redemption proceeds on a different basis,\nif necessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliance with applicable\nlaw. These circumstances may include, among\nothers, accommodating non-U.S. market holiday\nschedules and accounting for different\ntreatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of\ndividend record dates and dividend ex-dates\n(i.e., the last date the holder of a security\ncan sell the security and still receive\ndividends payable on the security sold). To\nthe extent contemplated by an Authorized\nParticipant's agreement with the Distributor\nor its agent, in the event an Authorized\nParticipant has submitted a redemption request\nin proper form but is unable to transfer all\nor part of the Creation Unit to be redeemed to\nthe Fund, at or prior to the time specified by\nthe Fund or its custodian on the Business Day\nafter the date of submission of such\nredemption request, the Distributor or its\nagent will accept the redemption request in\nreliance on the undertaking by the Authorized\nParticipant to deliver the missing shares as\nsoon as possible. Such undertaking shall be\nsecured by the Authorized Participant's\ndelivery and maintenance of collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. Such collateral must be\ndelivered no later than the time specified by\nthe Fund or its custodian on the Business Day\nafter the date of submission of such\nredemption request and shall be held by\nJPMorgan and marked-to-market daily. The fees\nof JPMorgan and any sub-custodians in respect\nof the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of\nthe collateral shall be payable by the\nAuthorized Participant. The Authorized\nParticipant Agreement permits the Fund to\nacquire shares of the Fund at any time and\nsubjects the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the\naggregate of the cost to the Fund of\npurchasing such shares, plus the value of the\nCash Amount, and the value of the collateral\ntogether with liability for related brokerage\nand other charges. Because the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund may trade on\nexchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange\nis closed or are otherwise not Business Days\nfor the Fund, shareholders may not be able to\nredeem their shares of the Fund or purchase or\nsell shares of the Fund on the Listing\nExchange on days when the NAV of such the Fund\ncould be significantly affected by events in\nthe relevant non-U.S. markets. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of\npayment postponed with respect to the Fund:\n(i) for any period during which the Listing\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Listing\nExchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for\nany period during which an emergency exists as\na\n\n58\n\nresult of which disposal of the shares of the\nFund's portfolio securities or determination\nof its NAV is not reasonably practicable; or\n(iv) in such other circumstance as is\npermitted by the SEC. Custom Baskets. Creation\nand Redemption baskets may differ and the Fund\nwill accept \u201c custom baskets. \u201d A custom\nbasket may include any of the following: (i) a\nbasket that is composed of a non-\nrepresentative selection of the Fund's\nportfolio holdings; (ii) a representative\nbasket that is different from the initial\nbasket used in transactions on the same\nbusiness day; or (iii) a basket that contains\nbespoke cash substitutions for a single\nAuthorized Participant. The Fund has adopted\npolicies and procedures that govern the\nconstruction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of the Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of the Fund may be taken\ninto account. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for the Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Fund, as set forth in the\nFund's policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets.\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of the\nFund. This summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to the Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific federal, state, local and non-U.S.\ntax consequences of investing in the Fund. The\nsummary is based on the laws and judicial and\nadministrative interpretations thereof in\neffect on the date of this SAI, all of which\nare subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Regulated Investment\nCompany Qualifications. The Fund intends to\nqualify for treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of the\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e. , partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than a\npartnership that derives at least 90% of its\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of the\nFund\u2019s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of the Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities of any one issuer, of two or more\nissuers of which 20% or more of the voting\nstock is held by the Fund and that are engaged\nin the same or similar trades or businesses or\nrelated trades or businesses (other than the\nsecurities of other RICs) or the securities of\none or more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships.\n\n59\n\nThe Fund may be able to cure a failure to\nderive at least 90% of its income from the\nsources specified above or a failure to\ndiversify its holdings in the manner described\nabove by paying a tax and/or by disposing of\ncertain assets. If, in any taxable year, the\nFund fails one of these tests and does not\ntimely cure the failure, the Fund will be\ntaxed in the same manner as an ordinary\ncorporation and distributions to its\nshareholders will not be deductible by the\nFund in computing its taxable income. Although\nin general the passive loss rules of the\nInternal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs,\nsuch rules do apply to a RIC with respect to\nitems attributable to an interest in a\nqualified publicly-traded partnership. The\nFund\u2019s investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, the Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, the Fund\nmust distribute to its shareholders at least\nthe sum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e. , income other than\nits net realized long-term capital gain over\nits net realized short-term capital loss),\nplus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii)\n90% of its net tax-exempt income for the\ntaxable year. The Fund will be subject to\nincome tax at regular corporate rates on any\ntaxable income or gains that it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders. If the Fund\nfails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC\nor fails to meet the distribution requirement,\nall of its taxable income will be subject to\ntax at regular corporate income tax rates\nwithout any deduction for distributions to\nshareholders, and such distributions generally\nwill be taxable to shareholders as ordinary\ndividends to the extent of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends-received deduction. Although the\nFund intends to distribute substantially all\nof its net investment income and its capital\ngains for each taxable year, the Fund may\ndecide to retain a portion of its income or\ngains. The Fund will be subject to U.S.\nfederal income taxation and excise taxation\n(as described below) to the extent it does not\ndistribute all (or, in the case of the excise\ntax, substantially all) of such income or\ngains. In certain circumstances, including in\ninstances where the operational cost of the\ndistribution would exceed the amount of the\nincome or excise tax, BFA or an affiliate may\nvoluntarily pay the tax on behalf of the Fund\nor reimburse the Fund for the tax. Moreover,\nif the Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any\nyear, it must pay out its earnings and profits\naccumulated in that year in order to qualify\nagain as a RIC. If the Fund fails to qualify\nas a RIC for a period greater than two taxable\nyears, the Fund may be required to recognize\nany net built-in gains with respect to certain\nof its assets ( i.e. , the excess of the\naggregate gains, including items of income,\nover aggregate losses that would have been\nrealized with respect to such assets if the\nFund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a\nRIC in a subsequent year. Net Capital Loss\nCarryforwards. Net capital loss carryforwards\nmay be applied against any net realized\ncapital gains in each succeeding year, until\nthey have been reduced to zero. In the event\nthat the Fund were to experience an ownership\nchange as defined under the Internal Revenue\nCode, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of the Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. Excise Tax. The\nFund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on\ncertain undistributed income if it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders in each\ncalendar year at least 98% of its ordinary\nincome for the calendar year plus at least\n98.2% of its capital gain net income for the\n12 months ended October 31 of such year. For\nthis purpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by the Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.\nDividends and other distributions by the Fund\nare generally treated under the Internal\nRevenue Code as received by the shareholders\nat the time the dividend or distribution is\nmade. However, any dividend or capital gain\ndistribution declared by the Fund in October,\nNovember or December of any calendar year and\npayable to shareholders of record on a\nspecified date in such a month shall be deemed\nto have been received by each shareholder on\nDecember 31 of such calendar year and to have\nbeen paid by the Fund not later than such\nDecember 31, provided such dividend is\nactually paid by the Fund during January of\nthe following calendar year. The Fund intends\nto distribute annually to its shareholders\nsubstantially all of its net tax-exempt\nincome, investment company taxable income and\nany net realized long-term capital gains in\nexcess of net realized short-term capital\nlosses (including any capital loss\ncarryovers). However, if the Fund retains for\ninvestment an amount equal to all or a portion\nof its net long-term capital gains in excess\nof its net short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers), it\nwill be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat\nrate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that\nevent, unless the retained amount is deemed\n\n60\n\nto be de minimis or the applicable tax is\notherwise reimbursed by BFA or an affiliate,\nthe Fund will generally designate such\nretained amounts as undistributed capital\ngains in a notice to its shareholders who (a)\nwill be required to include in income for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, as long-term\ncapital gains, their proportionate shares of\nthe undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled\nto credit their proportionate shares of the\ntax paid by the Fund on the undistributed\namount against their U.S. federal income tax\nliabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to\nthe extent their credits exceed their\nliabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled\nto increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, in their shares by an\namount equal to the excess of the amount in\nclause (a) over the amount in clause (b).\nOrganizations or persons not subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on such capital gains will\nbe entitled to a refund of their pro rata\nshare of such taxes paid by the Fund upon\nfiling appropriate returns or claims for\nrefund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\nthe Fund reports as capital gain dividends are\ntaxable as long-term capital gains, whether\npaid in cash or in shares and regardless of\nhow long a shareholder has held shares of the\nFund. All other dividends of the Fund\n(including dividends from short-term capital\ngains) from its current and accumulated\nearnings and profits ( \u201c regular dividends \u201d )\nare generally subject to tax as ordinary\nincome. Long-term capital gains are eligible\nfor taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20%\nfor non-corporate shareholders, depending on\nwhether their income exceeds certain threshold\namounts. If an individual receives a regular\ndividend qualifying for the long-term capital\ngain rates and such dividend constitutes an \u201c\nextraordinary dividend, \u201d and the individual\nsubsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or\nexchange of stock in respect of which the\nextraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss\nwill be long-term capital loss to the extent\nof such extraordinary dividend. An \u201c\nextraordinary dividend \u201d on common stock for\nthis purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an\namount greater than or equal to 10% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within an 85-day period, or\n(ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within a 365-day period.\nDistributions in excess of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits will, as\nto each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free\nreturn of capital to the extent of a\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund, and\nas a capital gain thereafter (if the\nshareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets). Distributions in excess of\nthe Fund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements,\nbut not in excess of the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. Shareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. No deduction would be allowed to\nan investor for interest on indebtedness\nincurred or continued to purchase or carry\nshares of the Fund to the extent the interest\ndeduction would relate to exempt-interest\ndividends received. A 3.8% U.S. federal\nMedicare contribution tax is imposed on net\ninvestment income, including, but not limited\nto, interest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly), and of estates and trusts.\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution may nevertheless be\ntaxable to them. If the Fund is the holder of\nrecord of any security on the record date for\nany dividends payable with respect to such\nsecurity, such dividends will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income not as of the date\nreceived but as of the later of (i) the date\nsuch security became ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividends ( i.e ., the date on which a\nbuyer of the security would not be entitled to\nreceive the declared, but unpaid, dividends);\nor (ii) the date the Fund acquired such\nsecurity. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its\nincome distribution requirements, the Fund may\nbe required to pay dividends based on\nanticipated earnings, and shareholders may\nreceive dividends in an earlier year than\nwould otherwise be the case. In certain\nsituations, the Fund may, for a taxable year,\ndefer all or a portion of its net capital loss\n(or if there is no net capital loss, then any\nnet long-term or short-term capital loss)\nrealized after October and its late-year\nordinary loss (defined as the sum of the\nexcess of post-October foreign currency and\npassive foreign investment company ( \u201c PFIC \u201d\n) losses over post-October foreign currency\nand PFIC gains, plus the excess of post-\nDecember ordinary losses over post-December\nordinary income) until the next taxable year\nin computing its investment company taxable\nincome and net capital gain, which will defer\nthe recognition of such realized losses. Such\ndeferrals and other rules regarding gains and\nlosses realized after October (or December)\nmay affect the tax character of shareholder\ndistributions.\n\n61\n\nSales of Shares. Upon the sale or exchange of\nshares of the Fund, a shareholder will realize\na taxable gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized and the\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund. A\nredemption of shares by the Fund will be\ntreated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain\nor loss will be treated as capital gain or\nloss if the shares are capital assets in the\nshareholder\u2019s hands and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor more than one year and short-term capital\ngain or loss if the shares are held for one\nyear or less. Any loss realized on a sale or\nexchange will be disallowed to the extent the\nshares disposed of are replaced, including\nreplacement through the reinvesting of\ndividends or capital gains distributions, or\nby an option, or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of the Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents a shareholder from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting his or her investment within a family\nof mutual funds. Backup Withholding. In\ncertain cases, the Fund will be required to\nwithhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S.\nTreasury such amounts withheld from any\ndistributions paid to a shareholder who: (i)\nhas failed to provide a correct taxpayer\nidentification number; (ii) is subject to\nbackup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has\nfailed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding; or (iv) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). Backup withholding is\nnot an additional tax and any amount withheld\nmay be credited against a shareholder's U.S.\nfederal income tax liability. Sections 351 and\n362. The Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has the\nright to reject an order for a purchase of\nshares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group\nof purchasers) would, upon obtaining the\nshares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund and if,\npursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, the Fund would have a\nbasis in the securities different from the\nmarket value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. If the Fund\u2019s basis in such\nsecurities on the date of deposit was less\nthan market value on such date, the Fund, upon\ndisposition of the securities, would recognize\nmore taxable gain or less taxable loss than if\nits basis in the securities had been equal to\nmarket value. It is not anticipated that the\nTrust will exercise the right of rejection\nexcept in a case where the Trust determines\nthat accepting the order could result in\nmaterial adverse tax consequences to the Fund\nor its shareholders. The Trust also has the\nright to require information necessary to\ndetermine beneficial share ownership for\npurposes of the 80% determination. Taxation of\nCertain Derivatives. The Fund\u2019s transactions\nin zero coupon securities, non-U.S.\ncurrencies, forward contracts, options and\nfutures contracts (including options and\nfutures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to\nthe extent permitted, will be subject to\nspecial provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode (including provisions relating to \u201c\nhedging transactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d )\nthat, among other consequences, may affect the\ncharacter of gains and losses realized by the\nFund ( i.e. , may affect whether gains or\nlosses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer\nFund losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also (a) will require the Fund to\nmark-to-market certain types of the positions\nin its portfolio ( i.e. , treat them as if\nthey were closed out at the end of each year)\nand (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income\nwithout receiving cash with which to pay\ndividends or make distributions in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\ntaxes. The Fund will monitor its transactions,\nwill make the appropriate tax elections and\nwill make the appropriate entries in its books\nand records when it acquires any zero coupon\nsecurity, non-U.S. currency, forward contract,\noption, futures contract or hedged investment\nin order to mitigate the effect of these rules\nand prevent disqualification of the Fund as a\nRIC. The Fund\u2019s investments in so-called \u201c\nsection 1256 contracts, \u201d such as regulated\nfutures contracts, most non-U.S. currency\nforward contracts traded in the interbank\nmarket and options on most security indexes,\nare subject to special tax rules. All section\n1256 contracts held by the Fund at the end of\nits taxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its\n\n62\n\nfair market value at the end of the taxable\nyear. The resulting gain or loss will be\ncombined with any gain or loss realized by the\nFund from positions in section 1256 contracts\nclosed during the taxable year. Provided such\npositions were held as capital assets and were\nnot part of a \u201c hedging transaction \u201d nor part\nof a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60% of the resulting net\ngain or loss will be treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain\nor loss will be treated as short-term capital\ngain or loss, regardless of the period of time\nthe positions were actually held by the Fund.\nAs a result of entering into swap contracts,\nthe Fund may make or receive periodic net\npayments. The Fund may also make or receive a\npayment when a swap is terminated prior to\nmaturity through an assignment of the swap or\nother closing transaction. Periodic net\npayments will generally constitute ordinary\nincome or deductions, while termination of a\nswap will generally result in capital gain or\nloss (which will be a long-term capital gain\nor loss if the Fund has been a party to the\nswap for more than one year). The cost of any\npayments made by the Fund on a swap\ntransaction will be netted pro rata against\nboth tax exempt and taxable gross income. With\nrespect to certain types of swaps, the Fund\nmay be required to currently recognize income\nor loss with respect to future payments on\nsuch swaps or may elect under certain\ncircumstances to mark such swaps to market\nannually for tax purposes as ordinary income\nor loss. Market Discount. Any market discount\nrecognized on a bond, including a tax-exempt\nbond, is taxable as ordinary income. A market\ndiscount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or adjusted issue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount ( \u201c OID \u201d ). To the\nextent the Fund does not include the market\ndiscount in income as it accrues, gain on the\nFund\u2019s disposition of such an obligation will\nbe treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued\nmarket discount. Original Issue Discount. OID\non tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the\nterm of the bond and is tax-exempt to the\nholder of the bond. Special U.S. federal\nincome tax rules apply to inflation-indexed\nbonds. Generally, all stated interest on such\nbonds is taken into income by the Fund under\nits regular method of accounting for interest\nincome. The amount of a positive inflation\nadjustment, which results in an increase in\nthe inflation-adjusted principal amount of the\nbond, is treated as OID. The OID is included\nin the Fund\u2019s gross income ratably during the\nperiod ending with the maturity of the bond,\nunder the general OID inclusion rules. The\namount of the Fund\u2019s OID in a taxable year\nwith respect to a bond will increase the\nFund\u2019s taxable income for such year without a\ncorresponding receipt of cash, until the bond\nmatures. As a result, the Fund may need to use\nother sources of cash to satisfy its\ndistributions for such year. The amount of\nnegative inflation adjustment, which results\nin a decrease in the inflation-adjusted\nprincipal amount of the bond, reduces the\namount of interest (including stated,\ninterest, OID, and market discount, if any)\notherwise includible in the Fund\u2019s income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year.\nReporting. If a shareholder recognizes a loss\nwith respect to the Fund\u2019s shares of $2\nmillion or more for an individual shareholder\nor $10 million or more for a corporate\nshareholder, the shareholder must file with\nthe IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form\n8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio\nsecurities are in many cases exempted from\nthis reporting requirement, but under current\nguidance, shareholders of a RIC are not\nexempted. The fact that a loss is reportable\nunder these regulations does not affect the\nlegal determination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by the Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by the Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally not subject to such\nwithholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced\nrate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN\nor IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its\nentitlement to benefits under a treaty. The\nwithholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor business within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate.\n\n63\n\nProperly-reported dividends are generally\nexempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where\nthey (i) are paid in respect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c\nqualified net interest income \u201d (generally,\nthe Fund\u2019s U.S. source interest income, other\nthan certain contingent interest and interest\nfrom obligations of a corporation or\npartnership in which the Fund is at least a\n10% shareholder or partner, reduced by\nexpenses that are allocable to such income);\nor (ii) are paid in respect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c\nqualified short-term capital gains \u201d\n(generally, the excess of the Fund\u2019s net\nshort-term capital gain over the Fund\u2019s long-\nterm capital loss for such taxable year).\nHowever, depending on its circumstances, the\nFund may report all, some or none of its\npotentially eligible dividends as such\nqualified net interest income or as qualified\nshort-term capital gains and/or treat such\ndividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible\nfor this exemption from withholding. In order\nto qualify for this exemption from\nwithholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will need\nto comply with applicable certification\nrequirements relating to its non-U.S. status\n(including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form).\nIn the case of shares held through an\nintermediary, the intermediary may withhold\neven if the Fund reports the payment as\nqualified net interest income or qualified\nshort-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders\nshould contact their intermediaries with\nrespect to the application of these rules to\ntheir accounts. Special rules may apply to a\nforeign shareholder receiving a Fund\ndistribution if at least 50% of the Fund's\nassets consist of interests in U.S. real\nproperty interests, including certain REITs\nand U.S. real property holding corporations\n(as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and\nTreasury regulations). Fund distributions that\nare attributable to gain from the disposition\nof a U.S. real property interest will be\ntaxable as ordinary dividends and subject to\nwithholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if\nthe foreign shareholder held no more than 5%\nof the Fund's shares at any time during the\none-year period ending on the date of the\ndistribution. If the foreign shareholder held\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares, the\ndistribution would be treated as income\neffectively connected with a trade or business\nwithin the U.S. and the foreign shareholder\nwould be subject to withholding tax at a rate\nof 21% and would generally be required to file\na U.S. federal income tax return. Similar\nconsequences would generally apply to a\nforeign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund\nshares unless the Fund is domestically\ncontrolled (meaning that more than 50% of the\nvalue of the Fund's shares is held by U.S.\nshareholders) or the foreign shareholder owns\nno more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any\ntime during the five-year period ending on the\ndate of sale. Finally, a domestically\ncontrolled Fund may be required to recognize a\nportion of its gain on the in-kind\ndistribution of certain U.S. real property\ninterests. Shareholders that are nonresident\naliens or foreign entities are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors concerning the\nparticular tax consequences to them of an\ninvestment in the Fund. A foreign shareholder\nalso may be subject to certain \u201c wash sale \u201d\nrules to prevent the avoidance of the tax\nfiling and payment obligations discussed above\nthrough the sale and repurchase of Fund\nshares. Shareholders that are nonresident\naliens or foreign entities are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors concerning the\nparticular tax consequences to them of an\ninvestment in the Fund. Separately, a 30%\nwithholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to: (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account holders\nand (ii) certain other foreign entities,\nunless they certify certain information\nregarding their direct and indirect U.S.\nowners. To avoid withholding, foreign\nfinancial institutions will need to: (i) enter\ninto agreements with the IRS that state that\nthey will provide the IRS information\nincluding the names, addresses and taxpayer\nidentification numbers of direct and indirect\nU.S. account holders; comply with due\ndiligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information as to\ntheir account holders, or (ii) in the event\nthat an applicable intergovernmental agreement\nand implementing legislation are adopted,\nprovide local revenue authorities with similar\naccount holder information. Other foreign\nentities will need to provide the name,\naddress and taxpayer identification number of\neach substantial U.S. owner or provide\ncertifications of no substantial U.S.\nownership, unless certain exceptions apply.\nShares of the Fund held by a non-U.S.\nshareholder at death will be considered\nsituated within the U.S. and subject to the\nU.S. estate tax. The foregoing discussion is a\nsummary of certain material U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations only and is not\nintended as a substitute for careful tax\nplanning. Purchasers of shares should consult\ntheir own tax advisors as to the tax\nconsequences of investing in such shares,\nincluding consequences under state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the foregoing\ndiscussion is based on applicable provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code, regulations,\njudicial authority and administrative\n\n64\n\ninterpretations in effect on the date of this\nSAI. Changes in applicable authority could\nmaterially affect the conclusions discussed\nabove, and such changes often occur.

Policy / Document\nRequirements and Statements The Boards of\nTrustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d ) of\ncertain open-end funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d )\nadvised by BlackRock Fund Advisors or\nBlackRock Advisors, LLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ),\nhave the responsibility for the oversight of\nvoting proxies relating to portfolio\nsecurities of the Funds, and have determined\nthat it is in the best interests of the Funds\nand their shareholders to delegate the\nresponsibility to vote proxies to BlackRock,\nsubject to the principles outlined in this\nPolicy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s authority to\nmanage, acquire and dispose of account assets,\nall as contemplated by the Funds\u2019 respective\ninvestment management agreements. BlackRock\nhas adopted the BlackRock Active Investment\nStewardship Global Engagement and Voting\nGuidelines (as from time to time amended, the\n\u201c Guidelines \u201d ) governing proxy voting by\nactive and fixed income index Funds managed by\nBlackRock. The Guidelines include \u201c climate\nand decarbonization \u201d guidelines which apply\nto the Funds listed in Appendix A, if any.\nBlackRock will cast votes on behalf of each of\nthe Funds covered by this policy on specific\nproxy issues in respect of securities held by\neach such Fund (or may refrain from voting) in\naccordance with the Guidelines. Conflicts\nManagement BlackRock Active Investment\nStewardship ( \u201c BAIS \u201d ) maintains policies\nand procedures that seek to prevent undue\ninfluence on BlackRock\u2019s proxy voting activity\nand to mitigate material conflicts of interest\nin the exercise of proxy voting\nresponsibilities. Potential material\nconflicts, and the resultant potential for\nundue influence, might be due to a\nrelationship between the investee company (or\nany shareholder proponent or dissident\nshareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock\u2019s\naffiliates or employees, or a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates. BlackRock has taken certain steps\nto mitigate potential conflicts, which are\noutlined in detail in the Guidelines. In\nmitigating conflicts, BAIS will adhere to the\nGuidelines. In certain instances, BAIS will\nengage an independent third-party voting\nservice provider to make proxy voting\nrecommendations as a further safeguard to\navoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw.\n\nA-2\n\nWith respect to the relationship between\nsecurities lending and proxy voting, shares on\nloan cannot be voted and BlackRock may\ndetermine to recall them for voting, as guided\nby BlackRock\u2019s fiduciary responsibility to act\nin clients\u2019 financial interests. The\nGuidelines set forth BlackRock\u2019s approach to\nrecalling securities on loan in connection\nwith proxy voting. Reports to the Board\nBlackRock will report on an annual basis to\nthe Directors on (1) a summary of the proxy\nvoting process as applicable to the Funds\ncovered by this policy in the preceding year\ntogether with a representation that all votes\nwere in accordance with the Guidelines and (2)\nany material changes to the Guidelines,\nincluding material changes to conflicts\nmanagement practices, that have not previously\nbeen reported.

BAIS works in partnership with\nBlackRock\u2019s investment teams, excluding index\nequity, providing expertise on investment\nstewardship, engaging with companies on behalf\nof those teams when appropriate, and assisting\nin recommending, operationalizing and\nreporting on voting decisions. The guidance\ninforms BAIS\u2019 voting recommendations to\nBlackRock\u2019s active portfolio managers. It\napplies to active equity holdings in\nBlackRock\u2019s fundamental equity, systematic\nequity and multi-asset solutions strategies.\nIt also may apply to holdings in BlackRock\u2019s\nindex and active fixed income strategies, to\nthe extent those strategies hold voting\nsecurities or conduct issuer engagements. The\nguidelines are not prescriptive as active\nportfolio managers have discretion as to how\nthey integrate these guidelines within their\ninvestment processes in light of their\nclients\u2019 or funds\u2019 investment objectives.\nThere are separate, independently developed\nprinciples and voting policies that are\napplied to BlackRock\u2019s index equity\ninvestments by a distinct and independent\nfunction, BlackRock Investment Stewardship.\nIntroduction to BlackRock BlackRock\u2019s purpose\nis to help more and more people experience\nfinancial well-being. We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world.\n\nA-4\n\nAbout BlackRock Active Investment Stewardship\nBlackRock Active Investment Stewardship (BAIS)\nis a specialist team within the Portfolio\nManagement Group and manages BlackRock\u2019s\nstewardship engagement and voting on behalf of\nclients invested in active strategies\nglobally. BAIS is also responsible for\nengagement with issuers in index fixed income\nstrategies, where appropriate. Our activities\nare informed by these Global Engagement and\nVoting Guidelines ( \u201c the Guidelines \u201d ) and\ninsights from active investment analysts and\nportfolio managers, with whom we work closely\nin engaging companies and voting at\nshareholder meetings. Engagement with public\ncompanies is the foundation of our approach to\nstewardship within fundamental active\ninvesting. Through direct dialogue with\ncompany leadership, we seek to understand\ntheir businesses and how they manage risks and\nopportunities to deliver durable, risk\nadjusted financial returns. Generally,\nportfolio managers and stewardship specialists\nengage jointly on substantive matters. Our\ndiscussions focus on topics relevant to a\ncompany\u2019s success over time including\ngovernance and leadership, corporate strategy,\ncapital structure and financial performance,\noperations and sustainability-related risks,\nas well as macro-economic, geopolitical and\nsector dynamics. We aim to be constructive\ninvestors and are generally supportive of\nmanagement teams that have a track record of\nfinancial value creation. We aim to build and\nmaintain strong relationships with company\nleadership based on open dialogue and mutual\nrespect. Different active equity strategies\nmay implement these voting guidelines\ndifferently, as a result of the latitude the\nportfolio manager has to make independent\nvoting decisions aligned with their portfolio\nobjectives and investment strategy. For\nexample, BAIS will generally vote the holdings\nin Systematic Active Equity portfolios in\naccordance with these guidelines. We provide\nvoting recommendations to fundamental equity\nportfolio managers, who may determine to vote\ndifferently based on their portfolio\ninvestment objectives and strategy. These\nguidelines discuss corporate governance topics\non which we may engage with management teams\nand board directors (1) and matters that\nroutinely come to a shareholder vote. We\nrecognize that accepted corporate governance\nnorms can differ across markets, and believe\nthese guidelines represent globally applicable\nelements of governance that support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to manage material risks and\nopportunities and deliver financial returns to\ninvestors. Generally, we believe companies\nshould observe accepted corporate governance\nnorms within their local markets or,\nparticularly in markets without well-\nestablished norms, aspire to widely recognized\ninternational best practices. As one of many\nminority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013 and\ndoes not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s strategy\nor its implementation. We look to companies to\nprovide disclosures that explain how their\napproach to corporate governance best aligns\nwith the financial interests of their\ninvestors. Our approach to stewardship within\nactive equities As shareholders of public\ncompanies, BlackRock\u2019s clients have certain\nfundamental rights, including the right to\nvote on proposals put forth by a company\u2019s\nmanagement or its shareholders. The voting\nrights attached to these clients\u2019 holdings are\nan important mechanism for investors to\nexpress support for, or concern about, a\ncompany\u2019s performance. As a fiduciary,\nBlackRock is legally required to make proxy\nvoting determinations, on behalf of clients\nwho have delegated voting authority to us, in\na manner that is consistent with their\ninvestment objectives. In general, we tend to\nsupport the recommendations of the board of\ndirectors and management. As indicated below,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhen we have concerns about how companies are\nserving the financial interests of our clients\nas their shareholders. We take a globally\nconsistent approach to voting but consider the\ndifferent corporate governance regulations and\nnorms in various markets. Votes are determined\non a case-by-case basis, in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s situation and the investment mandate\nwe have from clients. Please see page 16 for\nmore information about how we fulfil and\noversee BlackRock\u2019s non-index equity\ninvestment stewardship responsibilities. Our\napproach to stewardship within fixed income\nAlthough fixed income investors do not have\nthe right to vote at shareholder meetings,\nissuer engagement is a component of fixed\nincome investment strategies at BlackRock,\nparticularly those with sustainability\nobjectives in addition to financial\nobjectives. Most corporate governance-related\nfixed income engagements are undertaken in\nconjunction with the active investment\nstewardship team, and often active equity\ninvestors. In addition to the topics listed\nbelow, engagement with fixed\n\n(1) References to the board, board directors\nor non-executive directors should be\nunderstood to include supervisory boards and\ntheir members, where relevant.\n\nA-5\n\nincome investment teams can help inform an\nissuer\u2019s approach to structuring specialist\nissuances, such as green bonds, and the\nstandard terms and information in bond\ndocumentation. Boards of Directors Roles and\nresponsibilities There is widespread consensus\nthat the foundation of good corporate\ngovernance is an effective board of directors\nthat is able to advise and supervise\nmanagement in an independent and objective\nmanner (2) . We look to the board of directors\n(hereafter \u2018the board\u2019) to have an oversight\nrole in the establishment and realization of a\ncompany\u2019s strategy, purpose and culture. These\nconstructs are interdependent and, when\naligned, can better position a company to be\nresilient in the face of a changing business\nenvironment, help reduce the risks of\ncorporate or employee misconduct, and attract\nand retain the caliber of workers necessary to\ndeliver financial performance over time. In\npromoting the success of the company, the\nboard ensures the necessary resources,\npolicies and procedures are in place to help\nmanagement meet its strategic objectives\nwithin an agreed risk tolerance. One of the\nmost important responsibilities of the board\nis to appoint, and remove as necessary, the\nchief executive officer (CEO). In addition,\nthe board plays a meaningful role in\nmonitoring the performance of the CEO and\nother key executives, determining executive\ncompensation, ensuring a rigorous audit,\noverseeing strategy execution and risk\nmanagement and engaging with shareholders, and\nother stakeholders, as necessary. Composition\nand effectiveness Appointment process A formal\nand transparent process for identifying and\nappointing director candidates is critical to\nensuring the board is composed of directors\nwith the appropriate mix of skills and\nexperience. The board or a sub-committee\nshould determine the general criteria given\nthe company\u2019s circumstances (e.g., sector,\nmaturity, geographic footprint) and any\nadditional criteria for a specific role being\nfilled (e.g., financial expertise, industry\ntrack record). To inform the process, we\nencourage companies to review the skills and\nexperience of incumbent directors to identify\nany gaps and whether a director candidate\u2019s\ncharacteristics would be additive. We welcome\ndisclosures that explain how the board\nconsidered different skills, backgrounds and\nexperience to ensure the directors\ncollectively can be effective in fulfilling\ntheir responsibilities. We assess a company\u2019s\nboard composition against that of its peer\ngroup and local market requirements.\nShareholders periodically vote to elect,\nremove and nominate directors to serve on the\nboard. We may vote against the election of the\nmost senior independent director, or the chair\nof the relevant committee, where a company has\nnot demonstrated it has an appointment process\nthat results in a high functioning board with\nthe appropriate complement of skills,\nbackgrounds and experience amongst the\ndirectors to support strong financial\nperformance over time. We may vote against\nnewly nominated directors who do not seem to\nhave the appropriate skills or experience to\ncontribute to the board\u2019s effectiveness.\nIndependence Director independence from\nmanagement, significant shareholders or other\nstakeholders (e.g., government or employees)\nis of paramount importance to the protection\nof the interests of minority shareholders such\nas BlackRock\u2019s clients. At least half of the\ndirectors should be independent and free from\nconflicts of interest or undue influence (3) .\nThis ensures sufficient independent directors\nto have appropriately independent board\ncommittees. Companies domiciled in markets\nwith a higher threshold for board independence\nshould meet those requirements.\n\n(2) See the Corporate Governance Codes of\nGermany, Japan, and the UK, as well as the\ncorporate governance principles of the US\nBusiness Roundtable as examples. (3) Common\nimpediments to independence may include but\nare not limited to: current or recent\nemployment at the company or a subsidiary;\nbeing, or representing, a shareholder with a\nsubstantial shareholding in the company;\ninterlocking directorships; lengthy tenure,\nand having any other interest, business, or\nother relationship which could, or could\nreasonably be perceived to, materially\ninterfere with a director\u2019s ability to act in\nthe best interests of the company and\nshareholders.\n\nA-6\n\nWe may vote against the election of non-\nindependent directors if the board does not\nhave a sufficient balance of independence. We\nmay also vote against the election of the\nchair of the committee responsible for board\ncomposition if this is a perennial issue.\nIndependent board leadership Practices across\nmarkets differ, as do board structures, but we\nobserve two main approaches to independent\nboard leadership. One is a non-executive,\nindependent chair of the board who is\nresponsible for leading the board in the\neffective exercise of its duties. The other is\na lead or senior independent director, who is\nresponsible for coordinating with the other\nnon-executive directors and working closely\nwith the executive chair on the board agenda\nand other board procedures. In this case, the\nexecutive chair and the lead independent\ndirector work together to ensure the board is\neffectively fulfilling its responsibilities.\nIn our view, the independent leader of the\nboard, and/or the chair of a relevant\ncommittee, should be available to investors to\ndiscuss board governance matters such as CEO\nsuccession, executive pay, and board\nperformance. We look to boards to explain\ntheir independent board leadership model and\nhow it serves the interests of shareholders.\nWe may vote against the election of the chair\nof the committee responsible for board\ncomposition if there is not an identified\nindependent leader of the board with clear\nresponsibilities for board performance. We may\nvote against the most senior independent\ndirector if the board has a policy of not\nengaging with shareholders. Tenure and\nsuccession Boards should establish the length\nof time a director would normally be expected\nto serve, in line with market norms where\nthose exist. In such markets, we find it\nhelpful when companies disclose their approach\nto director tenure particularly around the\ncontributions of directors who have served for\nlonger periods than provided for in local\npractices. In our experience, long-serving\ndirectors could become less independent given\ntheir relationship with management and\ninvolvement in past board decisions.\nSuccession planning for board roles helps\nachieve the appropriate cadence of turnover\nthat balances renewal through the regular\nintroduction of directors with fresh\nperspectives and expertise with continuity\nthrough the retention of directors with long-\nterm knowledge of the board and company. In\nmarkets where there is not specific director\ntenure guidance, we may vote against the\nelection of the chair of the committee\nresponsible for board composition if there is\nnot a clearly disclosed approach to director\ntenure and board renewal. We may vote against\nthe election of directors who have served for\nlonger duration than typical in markets with\nspecific guidance, where the case for their\ncontinued service is not evident. Capacity To\nbe effective and engaged, directors must\ncommit appropriate time and energy to the\nrole. A board should assess the ability of its\nmembers to maintain an appropriate focus on\nboard matters and the company taking into\nconsideration competing responsibilities. We\nrecognize that board leadership roles vary\nacross markets in responsibilities and\nrequired time commitment but note that they\nare generally more intensive than a standard\ndirectorship. We will take local norms and\npractices into consideration when making our\nvoting determinations across markets. We may\nvote against the election of directors who do\nnot seem to have sufficient capacity to\neffectively fulfil their duties to the board\nand company. Director elections In support of\ndirector accountability to shareholders,\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. A classified\nboard structure may be justified by a company\nwhen it needs consistency and stability during\na time of transition, or on the basis of its\nbusiness model, e.g., a non-operating company\nsuch as closed-end funds. Shareholders should\nhave the opportunity to evaluate nominated\ndirectors individually rather than in bundled\nslates. We look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on each director\nstanding for election so that shareholders can\nassess their capabilities and suitability. We\nwill not support the election of directors\nwhose names and biographical details have not\nbeen disclosed sufficiently in advance of the\nshareholder meeting.\n\nA-7\n\nEach director\u2019s appointment should be\ndependent on receiving a simple majority of\nthe votes cast at the shareholder meeting.\nWhere a company\u2019s practices differ, we look to\nthe board to provide a detailed explanation as\nto how its approach best serves investors\u2019\ninterests. We may vote for shareholder or\nmanagement proposals seeking to establish\nannual election of directors and/or a simple\nmajority vote standard for director elections.\nWe may vote against all the directors standing\nfor election as part of a single slate if we\nhave concerns about the profile or performance\nof an individual director. Committees Many\nboards establish committees to focus on\nspecific responsibilities of the board such as\naudit and risk, governance and human capital,\nand executive compensation, amongst other\nmatters. We do not prescribe to companies what\ncommittees they should establish but we seek\nto understand the board\u2019s rationale for the\ncommittee structure it determines is\nappropriate. We note that, in some markets,\nregulation requires such committees. The\nresponsibilities of each committee should be\nclear, and the board should ensure that all\ncritical matters are assigned either to the\nfull board or to one of the committees. The\nboard should disclose to shareholders the\nstructure, membership, proportion of\nindependent directors, and responsibilities of\neach committee. The responsibilities we\ntypically see assigned to the three most\ncommon committees include: \u2022 Audit and risk \u2013\noversight responsibilities for the integrity\nof financial reporting, risk management and\ncompliance with legal and regulatory\nrequirements; may also play an oversight role\nin relation to the internal audit function and\nwhistleblowing mechanisms. \u2022 Nominating,\ngovernance and human capital \u2013 ensures\nappropriate corporate governance principles\nand practices including the periodic review of\nboard performance; responsible for succession\nplanning for CEO and key board roles, as well\nas the director appointment process; may also\nhave oversight responsibilities for human\ncapital management strategies including\ncorporate culture and purpose. \u2022 Executive\ncompensation \u2013 determines the compensation\npolicies and programs for the CEO and other\nexecutive officers, approves annual awards and\npayments under the policies; may also have\noversight responsibilities for firm- wide\ncompensation policies. We may vote against the\nelection of the chair of the committee or\nother directors serving as committee members\nto convey our concerns and provide feedback on\nhow a committee has undertaken its\nresponsibilities. We may vote against the\nelection of the most senior non-executive\ndirector if there is not a clearly disclosed\napproach to board committees. Board and\ndirector evaluation We consider it best\npractice for companies to conduct an annual\nreview of the performance of the board, the\ncommittees, the chair and individual\ndirectors. Periodically, this review could be\nundertaken by an independent third party able\nto bring objective perspectives to the board\non governance and performance. We encourage\ncompanies to disclose their approach to and\nobjectives of evaluations, including any\nchanges made to the board\u2019s approach as a\nresult. Access to independent advice To\nsupport the directors in effectively\nfulfilling their duties to the company and\nshareholders, they should have access to\nindependent advice. When circumstances\nwarrant, boards should be able to retain\nindependent third parties to advise on\ncritical matters. These might include new\nindustry developments such as emergent and\ndisruptive technology, operating events with\nmaterial consequences for the company\u2019s\nreputation and/or performance, or significant\ntransactions. Board committees may similarly\nretain third parties to advise them on\nspecialist matters such as audit, compensation\nand succession planning. Executive\ncompensation Boards should establish\ncompensation arrangements that enable the\ncompany to recruit, retain and reward the\ncaliber of executive management necessary to\nlead and operate the company to deliver\nsuperior financial returns over time. We focus\non alignment between variable pay and a\ncompany\u2019s financial performance. Generally,\nexecutive compensation arrangements have four\ncomponents: base salary, annual bonus that\nrewards performance against short-term\nmetrics, share-based incentives that reward\nperformance against long-term metrics, and\n\nA-8\n\npensions and benefits. In our observation,\nbase salary, pensions and benefits are largely\nset relative to market norms and benchmarks.\nThe annual bonus and share-based incentive, or\nvariable pay plans, tend to be tailored to the\ncompany, its sector and long-term strategy, as\nwell as the individuals the board is seeking\nto recruit and motivate. Recognizing the\nunique circumstances of each company, we\ndetermine whether to support a company\u2019s\napproach to executive compensation on a case-\nby-case basis. We rely on companies providing\nsufficient quantitative and qualitative\ninformation in their disclosures to enable\nshareholders to understand the compensation\narrangements and assess the alignment with\ninvestors\u2019 interests. Features we look for in\ncompensation arrangements include: \u2022 Fixed pay\ncomponents, including base salary, benefits\nand prerequisites that are appropriate in the\ncontext of the company\u2019s size, sector and\nmarket. \u2022 Variable pay subject to performance\nmetrics that are closely linked to the\ncompany\u2019s short- and long-term strategic\nobjectives. \u2022 Long-term incentives that\nmotivate sustained performance across a multi-\nyear period. \u2022 A balance between fixed and\nvariable pay, short- and long-term incentives,\nand specific instruments (cash and equity\nawards) that promotes pay program durability\nand seldom necessitates one-off, discretionary\npayments. \u2022 Outcomes that are consistent with\nthe returns to investors over the relevant\ntime period. \u2022 Board discretion, if allowed\nwithin the variable pay arrangements, to be\nused sparingly, responsibly and transparently.\n\u2022 A requirement, that participants in long-\nterm share-based incentive plans build a\nmeaningful shareholding in the company within\na defined time period, as determined by the\nboard. \u2022 Change of control provisions that\nappropriately balance the interests of\nexecutives and shareholders. \u2022 Clawback or\nmalus provisions that allow the company to\nrecoup or hold back variable compensation from\nindividuals whose awards were based on\nfraudulent activities, misstated financial\nreports, or executive misconduct. \u2022 Severance\narrangements that protect the company\u2019s\ninterests but do not cost more than is\ncontractual. We may vote against proposals to\nintroduce new share-based incentives, approve\nexisting policies or plans, or approve the\ncompensation report where we do not see\nalignment between executive compensation\narrangements and our clients\u2019 financial\ninterests. When there is not an alternative,\nor where there have been multi-year issues\nwith compensation misaligned with performance,\nwe may vote against the election of the chair\nof the responsible committee, or the most\nsenior independent director. Non-executive\ndirector compensation Companies generally pay\nnon-executive directors an annual retainer or\nfee in cash, shares or a combination of the\ntwo. Some companies also pay additional fees\nfor service on board committees or in board\nleadership roles. We do not support non-\nexecutive directors participating in\nperformance-based incentive plans as doing so\nmay create a conflict of interest and\nundermine their independence from management,\nwhom they oversee. Capital structure Boards\nare responsible for ensuring senior executive\nleadership has established a capital strategy\nthat achieves appropriate capital allocation\nand management in support of long-term\nfinancial resilience. Where company practices\ndiverge from those set out below, we look for\ncompanies to disclose why they view these\npractices to be aligned with shareholders\u2019\ninterests. We may vote against management\nproposals seeking capital-related authorities\nor the election of the most senior independent\ndirector if we have concerns about a company\u2019s\napproach. We may also support a shareholder\nproposal seeking conversion of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights to a one-share,\none-vote standard. Share issuance We assess\nrequests for share issuance for particular\ntransactions on a case-by-case basis. We will\ngenerally support authorities to issue shares\nwhen subject to pre-emptive rights, and up to\n20% absent pre-emptive rights. Companies\nshould seek regular approval of these\nauthorities to allow shareholders to take into\nconsideration how prior authorities were used,\nas well as the current circumstances of the\ncompany and the market environment.\n\nA-9\n\nShare buybacks We assess share buyback\nproposals in the context of the company\u2019s\ndisclosed capital management strategy and\nmanagement\u2019s determination of the appropriate\nbalance between investment that supports the\nlong-term growth of the company and returning\ncash to investors. We also take into\nconsideration the effect of a buyback program\non the company\u2019s balance sheet and executive\ncompensation arrangements and the price at\nwhich shares are repurchased relative to\nmarket price. Companies should seek regular\napproval of these authorities to allow\nshareholders to take into consideration how\nprior authorities were used, as well as the\ncurrent circumstances of the company and the\nmarket environment. We would normally expect\ncompanies to cancel repurchased shares. If a\ncompany plans to retain them as treasury\nshares, management should provide a detailed\nrationale in the context of the disclosed\ncapital management strategy. Dividends We\ngenerally defer to management and the board on\ndividend policy but may engage to seek further\nclarification where a proposed dividend\nappears out of line with the company\u2019s\nfinancial position. Differentiated voting\nrights We prefer companies to adopt a one-\nshare, one-vote structure for share classes\nwith the same economic exposure. Certain\ncompanies, particularly those new to public\nmarkets, could make the case to adopt a\ndifferentiated voting rights structure, or\ndual class stock. In those situations, we\nencourage companies to evaluate and seek\napproval for their capital structure on a\nperiodic basis. Transactions and special\nsituations We monitor developments in\ntransactions and special situations closely\nand undertake our own detailed analyses of\nproposals. Mergers and acquisitions We\nevaluate proposed mergers or acquisitions by\nassessing the financial outcome for our\nclients as minority shareholders. Management\nshould provide an assessment of the proposed\ntransaction\u2019s strategic and financial\nrationale, along with its execution and\noperational risks. We review each transaction\nindependently based on these factors and the\ndegree to which the transaction enhances\nshareholder value. The board should consider\nestablishing an ad hoc transaction committee\nto undertake an independent assessment of a\nsignificant merger or acquisition, in advance\nof making its recommendation to shareholders.\nWe will vote against transactions that, in our\nassessment, do not advance our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. Anti-takeover defenses In\nprinciple, we do not support companies using\nanti-takeover defenses, also known as poison\npills or shareholder rights plans, as they can\nentrench management and boards which have not\ndelivered long-term shareholder value. By\nexception, a poison pill may be supported if\nits purpose is to delay a takeover that is\nconsidered sub-optimal and enable management\nto seek an improved offer. Similarly,\nmanagement could make the case to use a poison\npill to block a shareholder activism campaign\nthat may be counter to the interests of other\ninvestors. Defense mechanisms introduced in\nthese circumstances should be limited in term\nand threshold, and also be closely monitored\nby the independent members of the board. We\nlook for a shareholder vote for any mechanisms\nexpected to be in place for more than 12\nmonths. Shareholder activism When companies\nare the focus of an activism campaign, we may\nengage with the activist to understand their\nanalysis and objectives, once they have gone\npublic. We will also engage with company\nmanagement and possibly board members,\nespecially those the activist may be seeking\nto replace. In our assessment, we evaluate\nvarious factors, including the concerns raised\nby the activist and the case for change; the\nquality of both the activist\u2019s and\nmanagement\u2019s plans; and the qualifications of\neach party\u2019s candidates. We evaluate each\ncontested situation by assessing the potential\nfinancial outcome for our clients as minority\nshareholders.\n\nA-10\n\nWe may support board candidates nominated by a\nshareholder activist if the activist has\ndemonstrated that their case for change\nenhances shareholder value, or if the\nincumbent board members do not demonstrate the\nrelevant skills and expertise or have a poor\ntrack record of protecting shareholders\u2019\ninterests. Significant shareholders and\nrelated party transactions Boards of companies\nwith affiliated shareholders or directors\nshould be able to demonstrate that the\ninterests of all shareholders are given\nequitable consideration. Transactions with\nrelated parties, such as significant\nshareholders or companies connected with the\npublic company, should be disclosed in detail\nand conducted on terms similar to what would\nobjectively have been agreed with a non-\nrelated party. Such transactions should be\nreviewed and approved by the independent\nmembers of the board, and if voted on, only\ndisinterested shareholders should vote.\nCorporate reporting, risk management and audit\nInvestors depend on corporate reporting, both\nregulatory and voluntary, to understand a\ncompany\u2019s strategy, its implementation and\nfinancial performance, as well as to assess\nthe quality of management and operations and\npotential for the company to create\nshareholder value over time. The board should\noversee corporate reporting and the policies\nand procedures underpinning the internal audit\nfunction and external audit. A company\u2019s\nfinancial reporting should provide decision-\nuseful information for investors and other\nstakeholders on its financial performance and\nposition. It should provide an accurate and\nbalanced assessment of the risks and\nopportunities the company faces in realizing\nits long-term strategy. Accordingly, the\nassumptions made by management and reviewed by\nthe auditor in preparing the financial\nstatements should be reasonable and justified.\nFinancial statements should be prepared in\naccordance with globally developed reporting\nstandards and any divergence from generally\naccepted accounting principles should be\nexplained in detail and justified. Accounting\nrestatements should be explained in detail and\nany remedial actions, and the implications of\nthese, disclosed. In this context, audit\ncommittees play a vital role in a company\u2019s\nfinancial reporting system by providing\nindependent oversight of the accounts,\nmaterial financial and, where appropriate to\nthe jurisdiction, nonfinancial information,\ninternal control frameworks and Enterprise\nRisk Management systems. In our view,\neffective audit committee oversight\nstrengthens the quality and reliability of a\ncompany\u2019s financial statements and provides an\nimportant level of reassurance to\nshareholders. Audit committees should have a\nprocedure in place for assessing the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process annually.\nSimilarly, material sustainability-related\nfactors that are integral to how a company\nmanages risks or generates revenue should be\ndisclosed. In our view, the standards\ndeveloped by the International Sustainability\nStandards Board, can be helpful to companies\nin preparing such reports (4) . Companies\nshould establish robust risk management and\ninternal control processes appropriate to the\ncompany\u2019s business, risk tolerance, and\nregulatory environment. A credible\nwhistleblowing system for employees, and\npotentially other stakeholders, can be a\nuseful mechanism for ensuring that senior\nmanagement and the board are aware of\npotential misconduct or breaches in risk\nmanagement and internal control processes. A\ncomprehensive audit conducted by an\nindependent audit firm contributes to investor\nconfidence in the quality of corporate\nreporting. It is helpful when the audit report\ngives some insight into the scope and focus of\nthe audit, as well as any critical audit\nmatters identified and how these were\nresolved. A comprehensive and effective audit\nis time and resource intensive, and the audit\nfee should be commensurate. Fees paid to the\naudit firm for non-audit consulting should not\nexceed the audit fee to a degree that may\nprompt concerns about the independence of the\naudit. The audit committee should explain its\nposition on auditor tenure and how it\nconfirmed that the auditor remained\nindependent.\n\n(4) The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-11\n\nWe may vote against the election of the\nresponsible directors if corporate reporting\nis insufficient or there are material\nmisstatements in financial reports. In markets\nwhere relevant, we may vote against a proposal\nto approve the financial statements or the\ndischarge of the board when we are concerned\nabout the quality of the reporting or the\naudit. We may vote against proposals to\nappoint the auditor, ratify the audit report,\nor approve the audit fee if we are concerned\nabout the auditor\u2019s independence, the quality\nof the audit, or there are material\nmisstatements in financial reports and the\nboard has not established reasonable\nremediation plans. Shareholder rights and\nprotections General shareholder meetings\nCompanies normally have an annual general\nmeeting of shareholders at which routine and\nnon-routine items of business are discussed\nand voted on by shareholders in attendance or\nsubmitting proxy votes. Companies should\ndisclose materials relevant to the shareholder\nmeeting sufficiently in advance so that\nshareholders can take them into consideration\nin their voting decisions. Many companies\noffer shareholders the option of participating\nin the meeting virtually which, whilst\nwelcome, should not limit the rights of\nshareholders to participate as they would\nduring an in-person meeting. We may vote\nagainst directors when materials related to\nthe business of the shareholder meeting are\nnot provided in a timely manner or do not\nprovide sufficient information for us to take\nan informed voting decision. We may vote\nagainst directors if the format of the\nshareholder meeting does not accommodate\nreasonable shareholder participation. Bylaw\namendments We review bylaw amendments proposed\nby management on a case-by-case basis and will\ngenerally support those that are aligned with\nthe interests of minority shareholders. Any\nmaterial changes to the bylaws should be\nexplained in detail and put to a shareholder\nvote. We may vote against bylaw amendments\nthat reduce shareholder rights and\nprotections. We may vote against directors if\nmaterial changes are made to the bylaws\nwithout shareholder approval. If not provided\nfor in the relevant corporate law, company\nbylaws should allow shareholders, individually\nor as a group, with a meaningful shareholding\nthe right to call a special meeting of\nshareholders. The shareholding required to\nexercise this right should balance its utility\nwith the cost to the company of holding\nspecial meetings. If not provided for in the\nrelevant corporate law, company bylaws should\nallow shareholders, individually or as a\ngroup, with a meaningful shareholding the\nright to nominate directors to the company\u2019s\nboard. The threshold for this right should be\nset so that shareholders can exercise it\nwithout being unduly disruptive to the board\u2019s\nown nomination process. Whilst we would not\nuse either of these rights ourselves, we see\nthem as important accountability mechanisms.\nWe may vote for a shareholder proposal seeking\nthe addition of either of these provisions to\na company\u2019s bylaws. Change of domicile We\ngenerally defer to management on proposals to\nchange a company\u2019s domicile as long as the\nrationale for doing so is consistent with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel and the related costs are immaterial. We\nmay vote against directors or a proposal to\nchange a company\u2019s domicile where it does not\nseem aligned with our clients\u2019 financial\ninterests. Changes to a company\u2019s purpose or\nthe nature of its business Plans to materially\nchange the nature of a company\u2019s business or\nits purpose should be disclosed and explained\nin the context of long-term strategy and\nbusiness dynamics. Such changes may\nsignificantly alter an investor\u2019s views on the\nsuitability of a company for their investment\nstrategy or portfolio. Where relevant, we may\nvote against proposals to change a company\u2019s\npurpose or the nature of its business if the\nboard has not provided a credible argument for\nchange.\n\nA-12\n\nShareholder proposals Shareholders in many\nmarkets, who meet certain eligibility\ncriteria, have the right to submit proposals\nto the general shareholder meeting asking a\ncompany to take a particular course of action\nsubject to the proposal being supported by a\nmajority of votes cast at the meeting. The\ntopics raised address a range of governance,\nsocial and environmental matters that may be\nrelevant to a company\u2019s business. Shareholder\nproposals are considered by many investors to\nbe an escalation tool when a company is\nunresponsive to their engagement. We vote on\nthese proposals on a case-by-case basis. We\nassess the relevance of the topic raised to a\ncompany\u2019s business and its current approach,\nwhether the actions sought are consistent with\nshareholders\u2019 interests, and what impact the\nproposal being acted upon might have on\nfinancial performance. Our general approach\nwhere we have concerns about a company\u2019s\ngovernance, disclosures or performance is to\nengage to understand the apparent difference\nin perspective. If we continue to believe the\ncompany is not acting in shareholders\u2019\nfinancial interests, we may vote against the\nelection of directors. We may support a\nrelevant shareholder proposal if doing so\nreinforces the points made in our engagement\nor is aligned with our clients\u2019 financial\ninterests. We generally do not support\nshareholder proposals that are legally binding\non the company, seek to alter a company\u2019s\nstrategy or direct its operations, or are\nunrelated to how a company manages risk or\ngenerates financial returns. BlackRock is\nsubject to legal and regulatory requirements\nin the U.S. that place restrictions and\nlimitations on how we can interact with the\ncompanies in which we invest on behalf of our\nclients, including our ability to submit\nshareholder proposals. We can vote on behalf\nof clients who authorize us to do so, on\nproposals put forth by others. Corporate\npolitical activities We seek to understand how\ncompanies ensure that their direct and\nindirect engagement in the policy making\nprocess is consistent with their public\nstatements on policy matters important to the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy. The board should\nbe aware of the approach taken to corporate\npolitical activities as there can be\nreputational risks arising from\ninconsistencies. Companies should, as a\nminimum, meet all regulatory disclosure\nrequirements on political activities, and\nideally, provide accessible and clear\ndisclosures to shareholders on policy\npositions, public policy engagement activities\nand political donations. To mitigate the risk\nof inconsistencies, companies can usefully\nassess the alignment between their policy\npriorities and the policy positions of the\ntrade associations of which they are active\nmembers and any engagements undertaken by\ntrade associations on behalf of members.\nGenerally, this is an engagement matter,\nalthough we may support a relevant shareholder\nproposal, or vote against directors, where a\ncompany\u2019s disclosures are insufficient, or it\nbecomes public that there is a material\ncontradiction in a company\u2019s public policy\npositions and its policy engagement.\nSustainability, or environmental and social,\nconsiderations We seek to understand how\ncompanies manage the risks and opportunities\ninherent in their business operations. In our\nexperience, sustainability-related factors (5)\nthat are relevant to a company\u2019s business or\nmaterial to its financial performance, are\ngenerally operational considerations embedded\ninto day-to-day management systems. Certain\nsustainability issues may also inform long-\nterm strategic planning, for example,\ninvesting in product innovation in\nanticipation of changing consumer demand or\nadapting supply chains in response to changing\nregulatory requirements. We recognize that the\nspecific sustainability-related factors that\nmay be financially material or business\nrelevant will vary by company business model,\nsector, key markets, and time horizon, amongst\nother considerations. From company disclosures\nand our engagement, we aim to understand how\nmanagement is identifying, assessing and\nintegrating material\n\n(5) By material sustainability-related risks\nand opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk\nand financial value creation in a company\u2019s\nbusiness model that have an environmental or\nsocial dependency or impact. Examples of\nenvironmental issues include, but are not\nlimited to, water use, land use, waste\nmanagement, and climate risk. Examples of\nsocial issues include, but are not limited to,\nhuman capital management, impacts on the\ncommunities in which a company operates,\ncustomer loyalty, and relationships with\nregulators. It is our view that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and manage\nmaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities relevant to their businesses.\nGovernance is the core means by which boards\ncan oversee the creation of durable financial\nvalue over time. Appropriate risk oversight of\nbusiness-relevant and material sustainability-\nrelated considerations is a component of a\nsound governance framework.\n\nA-13\n\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\ninto their business decision-making and\npractices. Doing so helps us undertake a more\nholistic assessment of a company\u2019s potential\nfinancial performance and the likely risk-\nadjusted returns of an investment. We may vote\nagainst directors or support a relevant\nshareholder proposal if we have concerns about\nhow a company is managing or disclosing its\napproach to material sustainability-related\nrisks that may impact financial returns. Key\nstakeholders In our view, companies should\nunderstand and take into consideration the\ninterests of the various parties on whom they\ndepend for their success over time. It is for\neach company to determine their key\nstakeholders based on what is material to\ntheir business and long-term financial\nperformance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. Companies\nthat appropriately balance the interests of\ninvestors and other stakeholders are, in our\nexperience, more likely to be financially\nresilient over time. Climate and\ndecarbonization investment objectives Certain\nactive BlackRock funds have climate and\ndecarbonization objectives in addition to\nfinancial objectives. Consistent with the\nobjectives of those investment strategies, our\nstewardship activity in relation to the\nholdings in those funds differs in some\nrespects from BAIS\u2019 benchmark guidelines,\nwhich are described above. Specifically, for\nthose funds\u2019 holdings, we look to investee\ncompanies to demonstrate that they are aligned\nwith a decarbonization pathway that means\ntheir business model would be viable in a low-\ncarbon economy, i.e., one in which global\ntemperature rise is limited to 1.5\u2070C above\npre-industrial levels. This approach is only\ntaken following BlackRock receiving the\nexplicit approval from the applicable fund\nboard. The decarbonization stewardship\nguidelines focus on companies which produce\ngoods and services that contribute to real\nworld decarbonization or have a carbon\nintensive business model and face outsized\nimpacts from the low carbon transition, based\non reported and estimated scopes 1, 2, and 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions. These companies\nshould provide disclosures that set out their\ngovernance, strategy, risk management\nprocesses and metrics and targets relevant to\ndecarbonization. These disclosures should\ninclude an explanation of the decarbonization\nscenarios a company is using in its near- and\nlong-term planning, as well as its scope 1,\nscope 2 and material scope 3 greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions and reduction targets for\nscope 1 and 2 emissions. As with the BAIS\nbenchmark policies, we consider the climate-\nrisk reporting standard issued by the\nInternational Sustainability Standards Board,\nIFRS S2, a useful reference for such\nreporting. Under these climate- and\ndecarbonization-specific guidelines, BAIS may\nrecommend a vote against directors or support\nfor a relevant shareholder proposal if a\ncompany does not appear to be adequately\naddressing or disclosing material climate-\nrelated risks. We may recommend supporting\nshareholder proposals seeking information\nrelevant to a company\u2019s stated low-carbon\ntransition strategy and targets that the\ncompany does not currently provide and that\nwould be helpful to investment decision-\nmaking. As under the BAIS benchmark approach,\nthe active portfolio managers are ultimately\nresponsible for voting consistent with their\ninvestment mandate and fund objectives.\nAppendix 1: How we fulfil and oversee our\nactive investment stewardship responsibilities\nOversight The Global Head of BAIS has primary\noversight of and responsibility for the team\u2019s\nactivities, including voting in accordance\nwith the BlackRock Active Investment\nStewardship Global Engagement and Voting\nGuidelines ( \u201c the Guidelines \u201d ), which\nrequire the application of professional\njudgment and consideration of each company\u2019s\nunique circumstances, as well as input from\nactive investors. BAIS is independent from\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship in our\nengagement and voting activities, reporting\nlines, and oversight. The Active Investment\nStewardship Oversight Committee, comprised of\nsenior representatives of the active\ninvestment, legal and risk teams, reviews and\nadvises on amendments to BAIS\u2019 Global\nEngagement and Voting Guidelines. The\nCommittee also considers developments in\ncorporate governance, related public policy,\nand market norms and how these might influence\nBAIS\u2019 policies and practices. The Committee\ndoes not determine voting decisions, which are\nthe responsibility of BAIS and the relevant\nactive equity investors.\n\nA-14\n\nIn addition, there is a standing advisory\ngroup of senior active investors who counsel\nBAIS on complex or high-profile votes before a\nrecommendation is finalized and escalated to\nthe portfolio managers with holdings in the\ncompany under consideration. This group also\nformally reviews any revisions to the\nEngagement and Voting Guidelines proposed by\nBAIS as part of its annual review. BAIS\ncarries out engagement with companies in\ncollaboration with active investment\ncolleagues, executes proxy votes, and conducts\nvote operations (including maintaining records\nof votes cast) in a manner consistent with the\nGuidelines. BAIS also conducts research on\ncorporate governance issues and participates\nin industry discussions to contribute to and\nkeep abreast of important developments in the\ncorporate governance field. BAIS may use third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties (see \u201c Use and oversight of\nthird-party vote services providers \u201d below).\nVoting guidelines and vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. We carefully consider\nthe voting items submitted to funds and other\nfiduciary account(s) (Fund or Funds) for which\nwe have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or\nrefrains from voting) for each Fund for which\nwe have voting authority based on our\nevaluation of the alignment of the voting\nitems with the long-term economic interests of\nour clients, in the exercise of our\nindependent business judgment, and without\nregard to the relationship of the issuer (or\nany shareholder proponent or dissident\nshareholder) to the Fund, the Fund\u2019s\naffiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees (see \u201c\nConflicts management policies and procedures,\n\u201d below). When exercising voting rights, BAIS\nwill normally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines, although\nportfolio managers have the right to vote\ndifferently on their holdings if they\ndetermine doing so is more aligned with the\ninvestment objective and financial interests\nof clients invested in the funds they manage.\nThe Guidelines are not intended to be\nexhaustive. BAIS applies the Guidelines on a\ncase-by-case basis, in the context of the\nindividual circumstances of each company and\nthe specific issue under review. As such, the\nGuidelines do not indicate how BAIS will vote\nin every instance. Rather, they reflect our\nview about corporate governance issues\ngenerally, and provide insight into how we\ntypically approach issues that commonly arise\non corporate ballots. The Guidelines are\nreviewed annually and updated as necessary to\nreflect changes in market practices,\ndevelopments in corporate governance and\nfeedback from companies and clients. In this\nway, BAIS aims to maintain policies that\nexplain our approach to governance practices\nmost aligned with clients\u2019 long-term financial\ninterests. In certain markets, proxy voting\ninvolves logistical issues which can affect\nBAIS\u2019 ability to vote such proxies, as well as\nthe desirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. BlackRock votes proxies in these\nsituations on a \u201c best-efforts \u201d basis. In\naddition, BAIS may determine that it is\ngenerally in the interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients not to vote proxies (or not to vote\nour full allocation) if the costs (including\nbut not limited to opportunity costs\nassociated with share-blocking constraints)\nassociated with exercising a vote are expected\nto outweigh the benefit the client would\nderive by voting on the proposal. Voting\nChoice BlackRock offers Voting Choice, a\nprogram that provides eligible clients with\nmore opportunities to participate in the proxy\nvoting process where legally and operationally\nviable. Voting Choice is currently available\nfor eligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nand Canada that use systematic active equity\n(SAE) and multi-asset strategies. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) are eligible for BlackRock\nVoting Choice regardless of their investment\nstrategies (6) .\n\n(6) With Voting Choice, SMAs have the ability\nto select from a set of voting policies from\nthird-party proxy advisers the policy that\nbest aligns with their views and preferences.\nBlackRock can then use its proxy voting\ninfrastructure to cast votes based on the\nclient\u2019s selected voting policy.\n\nA-15\n\nAs a result, the shares attributed to\nBlackRock in company share registers may be\nvoted differently depending on whether our\nclients have authorized BAIS to vote on their\nbehalf, have authorized BlackRock to vote in\naccordance with a third-party policy, or have\nelected to vote shares in accordance with\ntheir own policy. Our clients have greater\ncontrol over proxy voting because of Voting\nChoice. BlackRock does not disclose client\ninformation, including a client\u2019s selection of\nproxy policy, without client consent. Use and\noversight of third-party vote services\nproviders Third-party vote services providers\n\u2013 or proxy research firms - provide research\nand recommendations on proxy votes, as well as\nvoting infrastructure. As mentioned\npreviously, BlackRock contracts primarily with\nthe vote services provider ISS and leverages\nits online platform to supply research and\nsupport voting, record keeping, and reporting\nprocesses. We also use Glass Lewis\u2019 research\nand analysis as an input into our voting\nprocess. It is important to note that,\nalthough proxy research firms provide\nimportant data and analysis, BAIS does not\nrely solely on their information or follow\ntheir voting recommendations. A company\u2019s\ndisclosures, our past engagements and voting,\ninvestment colleagues\u2019 insights and our voting\nguidelines are important inputs into our\nvoting decisions on behalf of clients. Given\nthe large universe of actively held companies,\nBAIS employs the proxy services provider to\nstreamline the voting process by making voting\nrecommendations based on BAIS\u2019 voting\nguidelines when the items on a shareholder\nmeeting agenda are routine. Agenda items that\nare not routine are referred back to BAIS to\nassess, escalate as necessary to the relevant\nportfolio managers and vote. BAIS reviews and\ncan override the recommendations of the vote\nservices provider at any time prior to the\nvote deadline. Both BAIS and the vote services\nprovider actively monitor securities filings,\nresearch reports, company announcements, and\ndirect communications from companies to ensure\nawareness of supplemental disclosures and\nproxy materials that may require a\nmodification of votes. BAIS closely monitors\nthe third-party vote services providers we\ncontract with to ensure that they are meeting\nour service level expectations and have\neffective policies and procedures in place to\nmanage potential conflicts of interest. Our\noversight of service providers includes\nregular meetings with client service teams,\nsystematic monitoring of vendor operations, as\nwell as annual due diligence meetings in\naccordance with BlackRock\u2019s firmwide policies.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBAIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BAIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access. BAIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBAIS may engage directly with\n\nA-16\n\nBlackRock clients, business partners and/or\nthird parties, and/or with employees with\nsales, vendor management, or business\npartnership roles, in discussions regarding\nour approach to stewardship, general corporate\ngovernance matters, client reporting needs,\nand/or to otherwise ensure that proxy-related\nclient service levels are met \u2022 Determined to\nengage, in certain instances, an independent\nthird-party voting service provider to make\nproxy voting recommendations as a further\nsafeguard to avoid potential conflicts of\ninterest, to satisfy regulatory compliance\nrequirements, or as may be otherwise required\nby applicable law. In such circumstances, the\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider provides BlackRock with\nrecommendations, in accordance with the\nGuidelines, as to how to vote such proxies.\nBlackRock uses an independent third-party\nvoting service provider to make proxy voting\nrecommendations for shares of BlackRock, Inc.\nand companies affiliated with BlackRock, Inc.\nBlackRock may also use an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for: \u2022 public companies\nthat include BlackRock employees on their\nboards of directors \u2022 public companies of\nwhich a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as\na senior executive or a member of the board of\ndirectors \u2022 public companies that are the\nsubject of certain transactions involving\nBlackRock Funds \u2022 public companies that are\njoint venture partners with BlackRock, and \u2022\npublic companies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nActive Investment Stewardship Oversight\nCommittee appoints and reviews the performance\nof the independent third-party voting service\nproviders, generally on an annual basis.\nSecurities lending When so authorized,\nBlackRock acts as a securities lending agent\non behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a\nwell-regulated practice that contributes to\ncapital market efficiency. It also enables\nfunds to generate additional returns while\nallowing fund providers to keep fund expenses\nlower. With regard to the relationship between\nsecurities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock\ncannot vote shares on loan and may determine\nto recall them for voting, as guided by our\nfiduciary duty as an asset manager to our\nclients in helping them achieve their\ninvestment goals. While this has occurred in a\nlimited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). BAIS works with active\nportfolio managers, as well as colleagues in\nthe Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams, to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nshares would not warrant recalling securities\non loan. However, in certain instances,\nBlackRock may determine, in our independent\nbusiness judgment as a fiduciary, that the\nvalue of voting outweighs the securities\nlending revenue loss to clients and would\ntherefore recall shares to be voted in those\ninstances. Periodically, BlackRock reviews our\nprocess for determining whether to recall\nsecurities on loan in order to vote and may\nmodify it as necessary. Reporting and vote\ntransparency BAIS is committed to transparency\nin the stewardship work we do on behalf of\nclients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and disclosure on\nour website.\n\nA-17\n\nWant to know more? blackrock.com/stewardship |\nContactActiveStewardship@blackrock.com The\ndocument is provided for information purposes\nonly and is subject to change.

Policy\n/ Document Requirements and Statements The\nBoards of Trustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d )\nof certain open-end funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d )\nadvised by BlackRock Fund Advisors or\nBlackRock Advisors, LLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ),\nhave the responsibility for the oversight of\nvoting proxies relating to portfolio\nsecurities of the Funds, and have determined\nthat it is in the best interests of the Funds\nand their shareholders to delegate the\nresponsibility to vote proxies to BlackRock,\nsubject to the principles outlined in this\nPolicy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s authority to\nmanage, acquire and dispose of account assets,\nall as contemplated by the Funds\u2019 respective\ninvestment management agreements. BlackRock\nhas adopted the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship Global Benchmark Policy( \u201c\nGuidelines \u201d ) (as from time to time amended,\nthe \u201c Guidelines \u201d ) governing proxy voting by\nindex equity Funds managed by BlackRock,\nexcept for the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. In\naddition, BlackRock has adopted guidelines and\nprocedures (as from time to time amended, the\n\u201c BlackRock Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship Guidelines \u201d ) governing proxy\nvoting for matters covered in the BlackRock\nClimate and Decarbonization Stewardship\nGuidelines by the Funds listed in Appendix A.\nBlackRock will cast votes on behalf of each of\nthe Funds covered by this policy on specific\nproxy issues in respect of securities held by\neach such Fund (or may refrain from voting) in\naccordance with the Guidelines and the\nBlackRock Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship Guidelines, as applicable.\nConflicts Management BlackRock Investment\nStewardship ( \u201c BIS \u201d ) maintains policies and\nprocedures that seek to prevent undue\ninfluence on BlackRock\u2019s proxy voting activity\nand to mitigate material conflicts of interest\nin the exercise of proxy voting\nresponsibilities. Potential material\nconflicts, and the resultant potential for\nundue influence, might be due to a\nrelationship between the investee company (or\nany shareholder proponent or dissident\nshareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock\u2019s\naffiliates or employees, or a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates. BlackRock has taken certain steps\nto mitigate potential conflicts, which are\noutlined in detail in the Guidelines. In\nmitigating conflicts, BIS will adhere to the\nGuidelines. In certain instances, BIS will\nengage an independent third-party voting\nservice provider to make proxy voting\nrecommendations as a further safeguard to\navoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw.\n\nA-19\n\nWith respect to the relationship between\nsecurities lending and proxy voting, shares on\nloan cannot be voted and BlackRock may\ndetermine to recall them for voting, as guided\nby BlackRock\u2019s fiduciary responsibility to act\nin clients\u2019 financial interests. The\nGuidelines set forth BlackRock\u2019s approach to\nrecalling securities on loan in connection\nwith proxy voting. Reports to the Board\nBlackRock will report on an annual basis to\nthe Directors on (1) a summary of the proxy\nvoting process as applicable to the Funds\ncovered by this policy in the preceding year\ntogether with a representation that all votes\nwere in accordance with the Guidelines and the\nBlackRock Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship Guidelines, as applicable (2) any\nmaterial changes to the Guidelines and the\nBlackRock Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship Guidelines, including material\nchanges to conflicts management practices,\nthat have not previously been reported.\nAppendix A iShares Climate Conscious &\nTransition MSCI USA ETF\niShares ESG Advanced MSCI EAFE ETF\niShares ESG Advanced MSCI EM ETF\niShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF\niShares ESG MSCI EM Leaders ETF\niShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders ETF\niShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF\niShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF\niShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF\niShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF\niShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI World ex\nUSA ETF\n\nA-20\n\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship Global\nPrinciples for Benchmark Policies Effective as\nof January 2025 The purpose of this document\nis to provide an overarching explanation of\nBlackRock\u2019s global approach to our\nresponsibilities as a shareholder on behalf of\nour clients, the principles that guide our\ndialogue with companies, and our commitments\nto clients in terms of our own governance and\ntransparency.\n                                              \n  Introduction to BlackRock Investment  A-21  \n  Stewardship                                 \n  Philosophy on investment stewardship  A-22  \n  Shareholder rights                    A-22  \n  Stewardship in practice               A-22  \n  Key themes                            A-23  \n  Boards and directors                  A-23  \n  Auditors and audit-related issues     A-25  \n  Capital structure, mergers, asset           \n  sales, and other                      A-26  \n  special transactions                        \n  Executive compensation                A-27  \n  Material sustainability-related             \n  risks and                             A-28  \n  opportunities                               \n  Other corporate governance matters          \n  and shareholder                       A-30  \n  protections                                 \n  Shareholder proposals                 A-31  \n  BlackRock\u2019s oversight of its                \n  investment                            A-31  \n  stewardship activities                      \n  Voting guidelines and vote execution  A-32  \n  Voting Choice                         A-32  \n  Conflicts management policies and     A-33  \n  procedures                                  \n  Securities lending                    A-34  \n  Reporting and vote transparency       A-34  \n                                              \nIntroduction to BlackRock Investment\nStewardship BlackRock\u2019s clients depend on us\nto help them meet their varied investment\ngoals. We consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to be an informed, engaged\nshareholder on their behalf, given the\nbusiness decisions that companies make have a\ndirect impact on our clients\u2019 long-term\ninvestment outcomes and financial well-being.\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) is a\ndedicated function within BlackRock, which is\nresponsible for engaging with public companies\non behalf of index strategies. Investment\nStewardship is one of the ways we fulfill our\nfiduciary responsibilities as an asset manager\nto our clients. Our sole objective when\nconducting our stewardship program is to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term financial\ninterests. (1) BIS takes a long-term approach\nin our stewardship efforts, reflecting the\ninvestment horizons of the majority of our\nclients. BIS does this through: 1. Engaging\nwith companies in a two-way dialogue to build\nour understanding of a company\u2019s practices and\ninform our voting decisions.\n\n(1) BIS\u2019 Benchmark Policies, and the vote\ndecisions made consistent with these policies,\ntake a financial materiality-based approach\nand are focused solely on advancing clients'\nfinancial interests. BIS\u2019 Benchmark Policies\u2013\ncomprised of the BIS Global Principles,\nregional voting guidelines, and engagement\npriorities \u2013 apply to clients\u2019 assets invested\nthrough index strategies and provide guidance\non our position on common corporate governance\nmatters. We take a globally consistent\napproach, while recognizing the unique markets\nand sectors in which companies operate.\nBlackRock offers a wide range of investment\nproducts and funds to support our clients\u2019\nunique and varied investment objectives. Other\nmaterials on the BIS website might also\nprovide useful context. A-21\n\n2. Voting at shareholder meetings on\nmanagement and shareholder proposals on behalf\nof clients who have delegated voting authority\nto BlackRock. 3. Contributing to industry\ndialogue on stewardship to share our\nperspectives on matters that may impact our\nclients\u2019 investments. 4. Reporting on our\nactivities to inform clients about our\nstewardship efforts on their behalf through a\nrange of publications and direct reporting.\nPhilosophy on investment stewardship Sound\ngovernance is critical to the success of a\ncompany, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. Research indicates that high-\nperforming companies will effectively evaluate\nand address risks and opportunities relevant\nto their businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. (2)\nSetting, executing, and overseeing strategy\nare the responsibility of management and the\nboard. As one of many minority shareholders,\nBlackRock cannot \u2013 and does not try to \u2013\ndirect a company\u2019s strategy or its\nimplementation. Our role, on behalf of\nBlackRock\u2019s clients as long-term investors, is\nto better understand how corporate leadership\nis managing material risks and capitalizing on\nopportunities to help protect and enhance the\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver long-term\nfinancial returns. We aim to take a globally\nconsistent approach, while recognizing the\nunique markets and sectors in which companies\noperate. Shareholder rights Corporate law,\nregulations and listing rules in most markets\nestablish certain fundamental rights attached\nto shareholding. Shareholders should have the\nright to: \u2022 Elect, remove, and nominate\ndirectors, approve the appointment of the\nauditor, and amend the corporate charter or\nby- laws. \u2022 Vote on key board decisions that\nare material to the protection of their\ninvestment, including but not limited to,\nchanges to the purpose of the business,\ndilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and\nthe distribution of income and capital\nstructure. \u2022 Access sufficient and timely\ninformation on material governance, strategic,\nand business matters to make informed\ndecisions. To protect the interest of minority\nshareholders like BlackRock\u2019s clients, BIS\nholds the view that shareholder voting rights\nshould be proportionate to economic\nownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one share, one\nvote \u201d helps to achieve this balance.\nStewardship in practice The assets BlackRock\nmanages belong to our clients, which include\npublic and private pension plans, insurers,\nofficial institutions, endowments,\nuniversities, charities, family offices,\nwealth managers, and ultimately, the\nindividual investors that they serve. Through\nstewardship, we assess how companies are\ncreating long-term financial value to serve\nour clients, many of whom are saving for long-\nterm goals, such as retirement. As\nshareholders of public companies, our clients\nhave the right to vote on matters proposed by\na company\u2019s management or its shareholders.\nVoting is an important mechanism for investors\nto express support for, or concern about, a\ncompany\u2019s performance and most of our clients\nauthorize BlackRock to exercise this right on\ntheir behalf. For those clients, and as a\nfiduciary, BlackRock is legally required to\nmake proxy voting determinations in a manner\nthat is consistent with their investment\nobjectives. BIS does this by casting votes in\nfavor of proposals that, in our assessment,\nwill promote stronger governance and better\noperating practices and, in turn, potentially\nenhance long-term shareholder value. Our vote\ndecisions are informed by our in-depth\nanalysis of company disclosures, engagement\nwith boards and management teams, third-party\nresearch, and comparisons against a company\u2019s\nindustry peers. BIS takes a constructive,\nlong-term approach to our engagement with\ncompanies, reflecting the investment horizons\nof the majority of our clients. An engagement\nis a meeting between BIS and a company\u2019s board\nand management that helps improve our\nunderstanding of the company\u2019s business model\nand material risks and opportunities, to\ninform our voting\n\n(2) PwC, \u201c The 3 things all high-performing\ncompanies do \u201d . Harvard Business Review, \u201c 6\nStrategic Concepts That Set High-Performing\nCompanies Apart \u201d , March 2024.\n\nA-22\n\ndecisions on behalf of clients who authorize\nus to vote on their behalf. In these two-way\nconversations, we listen to and learn directly\nfrom company directors and executives and ask\nquestions relevant to their business. Either a\ncompany or BIS can request an engagement. Many\nof the engagements are initiated by companies\nto discuss their long-term strategy, risk and\nopportunity set, and management\u2019s plan to\ndeliver financial returns through business\ncycles. The ongoing, multiyear nature of our\nengagements allows us to build strong\nrelationships with company leadership and\nmutual understanding on key matters of\ncorporate governance and the drivers of long-\nterm financial performance. Generally, we\nsupport the vote recommendations of the board\nof directors and management. In case of\nconcerns, we typically raise these through\ndialogue with board members and management\nteams first. When we determine it is in our\nclients\u2019 financial interests to convey concern\nto companies through voting, we do so in two\nforms: we might not support the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or we\nmight not support management\u2019s voting\nrecommendation on a shareholder proposal. Key\nthemes While accepted standards and norms of\ncorporate governance can differ between\nmarkets, in our experience, there are certain\nglobally applicable fundamental elements of\ncorporate governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted corporate\ngovernance standards in their domestic market,\n(3) and we ask that, if they do not, they\nexplain how their approach better supports\ndurable, long-term financial value creation.\nThese Principles cover seven key subjects: \u2022\nBoards and directors \u2022 Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues \u2022 Capital structure, mergers,\nasset sales, and other special transactions \u2022\nExecutive compensation \u2022 Material\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\n\u2022 Other corporate governance matters and\nshareholder protections \u2022 Shareholder\nproposals Our regional and market-specific\nvoting guidelines explain how these Principles\ninform our voting decisions in relation to\ncommon ballot items for shareholder meetings\nin those markets. Alongside the Principles and\nregional voting guidelines, BIS publishes our\nengagement priorities which reflect the five\nthemes on which we most frequently engage\ncompanies, where they are relevant, as these\ncan be a source of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship program globally and within each\nmarket. The BIS policies are not prescriptive,\napplied on a pragmatic, case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration a number of factors,\nincluding the sector, market, and business\nenvironment within which a company is\noperating. Boards and directors Companies\nwhose boards are comprised of appropriately\nqualified, engaged directors with professional\ncharacteristics relevant to a company\u2019s\nbusiness enhance the ability of the board to\nadd value and be the voice of shareholders in\nboard discussions. A strong board gives a\ncompany a competitive advantage, providing\nvaluable oversight and contributing to the\nmost important management decisions that\nsupport long-term financial performance. As\npart of their responsibilities, board members\nhave a fiduciary duty to shareholders to\noversee the strategic direction, operations,\nand risk management of a company. This is why\nour investment stewardship efforts have always\nstarted with the performance of the board of\ndirectors, and why we see engagement with, and\nthe election of, directors as one of our most\nimportant responsibilities. We engage, as\nnecessary, with members of the board\u2019s\nnominating and/or governance committee to\nassess whether governance practices\n\n(3) Our regional voting guidelines, which we\npublish on the BIS website, reflect these\ndifferent market standards and norms.\nDepending on the market, generally accepted\npractice is informed by corporate law, market\nregulation, best practices, and industry\ninitiatives, amongst other factors.\n\nA-23\n\nand board composition are appropriate given a\ncompany\u2019s business model and we take into\nconsideration a number of factors, including\nthe sector, market, and business environment\nwithin which a company is operating. We view\nit as good practice when the board establishes\nand maintains a framework of robust and\neffective governance mechanisms to support its\noversight of the company\u2019s strategy and\noperations consistent with the long-term\neconomic interests of investors. There should\nbe clear descriptions of the role of the board\nand the committees of the board and how\ndirectors engage with and oversee management.\nDisclosure of material risks that may affect a\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and financial\nvalue creation, including material\nsustainability-related factors when relevant,\nis helpful for investors to appropriately\nunderstand and assess how effectively\nmanagement is identifying, managing, and\nmitigating such risks. We seek to understand\nmanagement's long-term strategy and the\nmilestones against which investors should\nassess its implementation. If any strategic\ntargets are significantly missed or materially\nrestated, we find it helpful when company\ndisclosures provide a detailed explanation of\nthe changes and an indication of the board's\nrole in reviewing the revised targets. We look\nto the board to articulate the effectiveness\nof these mechanisms in overseeing the\nmanagement of business risks and opportunities\nand the fulfillment of the company\u2019s strategy.\nWhere a company has not adequately disclosed\nand demonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we may consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration its governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are factors we may take into\nconsideration. Regular accountability through\ndirector elections To ensure accountability\nfor their actions on behalf of shareholders,\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. (4) Annual\ndirector elections allow shareholders to\nreaffirm their support for board members\nand/or hold them accountable for their\ndecisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be brought\nonto the board periodically to refresh the\ngroup\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board and seek a balance between\nthe knowledge and experience of longer-serving\ndirectors and the fresh perspectives of\ndirectors who joined more recently. We\nencourage companies to regularly review the\neffectiveness of their board (including its\nsize), and assess directors nominated for\nelection in the context of the composition of\nthe board as a whole. In our view, the\ncompany\u2019s assessment should consider a number\nof factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe breadth and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\ncollectively contribute to the board's\neffectiveness in advising and overseeing\nmanagement in delivering long-term financial\nreturns. Director independence \u2014 from\nmanagement, significant shareholders, or other\nrelated parties \u2013 is a central tenet of sound\ncorporate governance across markets. (5) We\nencourage boards to have a sufficient number\nof independent directors, free from conflicts\nof interest or undue influence, to ensure\nobjectivity in the decision-making of the\nboard and its ability to oversee management.\nWe generally consider it good practice for\nindependent directors to make a majority of\nthe board, or in the case of controlled\ncompanies, at least one-third. Common\nimpediments to independence may include but\nare not limited to: \u2022 Current or recent\nemployment at the company or a subsidiary\n\n(4) In most markets directors stand for re-\nelection on an annual or triennial basis, as\ndetermined by corporate law, market regulation\nor voluntary best practice. (5) Please see:\nTokyo Stock Exchange. \u201c Japan\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Code . \u201d June 11, 2021; Financial\nReporting Council. \u201c UK Corporate Governance\nCode . \u201d July 16, 2018; Investor Stewardship\nGroup. \u201c Corporate Governance Principles for\nUS Listed Companies . \u201d\n\nA-24\n\n\u2022 Being, or representing, a shareholder with a\nsubstantial shareholding in the company \u2022\nInterlocking directorships \u2022 Having any other\ninterest, business, or other relationship\nwhich could, or could reasonably be perceived\nto, materially interfere with a director\u2019s\nability to act in the best interests of the\ncompany and shareholders In our experience,\nboards are most effective at overseeing and\nadvising management when there is a senior,\nindependent board leader. This director may\nchair the board, or, where the chair is also\nthe CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be\ndesignated as a lead independent director. The\nrole of this director is to enhance the\neffectiveness of the independent members of\nthe board through shaping the agenda, ensuring\nadequate information is provided to the board,\nand encouraging independent director\nparticipation in board deliberations. The lead\nindependent director or another appropriate\ndirector should be available to meet with\nshareholders in those situations where an\nindependent director is best placed to explain\nand contextualize a company\u2019s approach. There\nare matters for which the board has\nresponsibility that may involve a conflict of\ninterest for executives or for affiliated\ndirectors or require additional focus. It is\nour view that objective oversight of such\nmatters is best achieved when the board forms\ncommittees with a majority of independent\ndirectors, depending on market norms and a\ncompany\u2019s ownership structure. In many\nmarkets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in a\nvariety of experiences, perspectives, and\nskillsets in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans of promoting diversity of thought to\navoid \u201c group think \u201d in the board\u2019s exercise\nof its responsibilities to advise and oversee\nmanagement. In assessing board composition, we\ntake a case-by-case approach based on a\ncompany\u2019s board size, business model,\nstrategy, location and market capitalization.\nWe look for companies to explain how their\napproach to board composition supports the\ncompany\u2019s governance practices. We note that\nin many markets, policymakers have set board\ngender diversity goals which we may discuss\nwith companies, particularly if there is a\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. We ask boards to disclose,\nconsistent with local laws, how diversity,\nincluding professional and personal\ncharacteristics, is considered in board\ncomposition, given the company\u2019s long-term\nstrategy and business model. (6) Sufficient\ncapacity As the role and expectations of a\ndirector are increasingly demanding, directors\nmust be able to commit an appropriate amount\nof time to board and committee matters. It is\nimportant that directors have the capacity to\nmeet all of their responsibilities - including\nwhen there are unforeseen events \u2013 and\ntherefore, they should not take on an\nexcessive number of roles that would impair\ntheir ability to fulfill their duties.\nAuditors and audit-related issues BlackRock\nrecognizes the critical importance of\nfinancial statements, which should provide a\ntrue and fair picture of a company\u2019s financial\ncondition. Accordingly, we look for the\nassumptions made by management and reviewed by\nthe auditor in preparing the financial\nstatements to be reasonable and justified. The\naccuracy of financial statements, inclusive of\nfinancial and non-financial information as\nrequired or permitted under market-specific\naccounting rules, is of paramount importance\nto BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader\n\n(6) Personal characteristics may include, but\nare not limited to, gender; race/ethnicity;\ndisability; veteran status; LGBTQ+; and\nnational, Indigenous, religious, or cultural\nidentity.\n\nA-25\n\nrange of risks and opportunities have the\npotential to materially impact financial\nperformance. Over time, we anticipate\ninvestors and other users of company reporting\nwill increasingly seek to understand and\nscrutinize the assumptions underlying\nfinancial statements, particularly those that\npertain to the impact of the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy on a company\u2019s business\nmodel and asset mix. We recognize that this is\nan area of evolving practice and note that\ninternational standards setters, such as the\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards\n(IFRS) Board and the International Auditing\nand Assurance Standards Board (IAASB),\ncontinue to develop their guidance to\ncompanies. (7) In this context, audit\ncommittees, or equivalent, play a vital role\nin a company\u2019s financial reporting system by\nproviding independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. (8) In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. Audit committees\nor equivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, we look for the fees earned to be\ndisclosed and explained. We look for Audit\ncommittees to have in place a procedure for\nassessing annually the independence of the\nauditor and the quality of the external audit\nprocess. Comprehensive disclosure provides\ninvestors with a sense of the company\u2019s long-\nterm operational risk management practices\nand, more broadly, the quality of the board\u2019s\noversight. We look to the audit or risk\ncommittee to periodically review the company\u2019s\nrisk assessment and risk management policies\nand the significant risks and exposures\nidentified by management, the internal\nauditors or the independent auditors and\nmanagement\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk. Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions The capital structure of a\ncompany is critical to shareholders as it\nimpacts the value of their investment and the\npriority of their interest in the company\nrelative to that of other equity or debt\ninvestors. Pre-emptive rights are a key\nprotection for shareholders against the\ndilution of their interests. Effective voting\nrights are basic rights of share ownership and\na core principle of effective governance.\nShareholders, as the residual claimants, have\nthe strongest interest in protecting the\nfinancial value of the company, and voting\nrights should match economic exposure, i.e.\none share, one vote. In principle, we disagree\nwith the creation of a share class with\nequivalent economic exposure and preferential,\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nthis structure violates the fundamental\ncorporate governance principle of\nproportionality and results in a concentration\nof power in the hands of a few shareholders,\nthus disenfranchising other shareholders and\namplifying any potential conflicts of\ninterest. However, we recognize that in\ncertain markets, at least for a period of\ntime, companies may have a valid argument for\nlisting dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally,\n\n(7) IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. (8) Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\nPlease see the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO), \u201c Enterprise Risk Management \u201d , 2023.\n\nA-26\n\nthey should seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. Executive\ncompensation is an important tool used by\ncompanies to support long-term financial value\ncreation. In our experience, well-structured\ncompensation policies reward the successful\ndelivery of strategic, operational, and/or\nfinancial goals, encourage an appropriate risk\nappetite, and align the interests of\nshareholders and executives through equity\nownership. We look for there to be a clear\nlink between variable pay and operational and\nfinancial performance. Performance metrics\nshould be stretching and aligned with a\ncompany\u2019s strategy and business model. BIS\ndoes not have a position on whether companies\nshould use sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but, where they are\nincluded, we look to companies to be as\nrigorous as they would be in setting other\nfinancial or operational targets. Long-term\nincentive plans should encompass timeframes\nthat 1) are distinct from annual executive\ncompensation structures and metrics, and 2)\nencourage the delivery of strong financial\nresults over a period of years. When\ndesigning, reviewing, and approving executive\ncompensation policies, board compensation\ncommittees \u2013 or board members responsible for\nsetting executive compensation \u2013 should\ncarefully consider the company\u2019s specific\ncircumstances, such as its risk profile, the\nenvironment in which it operates, and the\nindividuals the board is trying to attract,\nretain and incentivize. We look to the\ncompensation committees to guard against\ncontractual arrangements that would entitle\nexecutives to material compensation for early\ntermination of their employment. Finally,\npension contributions and other deferred\ncompensation arrangements should be reasonable\nin light of market practices or the company\u2019s\nbusiness and executive compensation\nstrategies. We are not supportive of one-off\nor special bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we appreciate disclosure relating\nto how and why the discretion was used, and\nhow the adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than also\nconsidering rigorous measures of\noutperformance. We encourage companies to\nclearly explain how compensation outcomes have\nrewarded performance. We encourage boards to\nconsider building clawback provisions into\nincentive plans such that companies could\nclawback compensation or require executives to\nforgo awards when compensation was based on\nfaulty financial statements or deceptive\nbusiness practices. We also favor recoupment\nfrom or the foregoing of the grant of any\nawards by any senior\n\nA-27\n\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. In our\nview, non-executive directors should be\ncompensated in a manner that is commensurate\nwith the time and effort expended in\nfulfilling their professional\nresponsibilities. Additionally, these\ncompensation arrangements should not risk\ncompromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. BIS may convey concerns\nthrough not supporting management\u2019s proposals\nto approve compensation, where they are on the\nagenda. We may also vote against members of\nthe compensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. (9) As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework that supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure\nallows investors to effectively evaluate\ncompanies\u2019 strategy and business practices\nrelated to material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities. We find it helpful\nwhen companies\u2019 disclosures demonstrate that\nthey have a resilient business model that\nintegrates material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities into their strategy,\nrisk management, and metrics and targets,\nincluding industry-specific metrics. The\nInternational Sustainability Standards Board\n(ISSB) standards, IFRS S1 and S2 (10) may\nprove helpful to companies in preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have both\nconverged under the ISSB. We recognize that\ncompanies may phase in reporting aligned with\nthe ISSB standards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, while we do not\nprescribe timelines regarding when companies\nmake these disclosures, we encourage them to\nproduce climate and other sustainability-\nrelated disclosures sufficiently in advance of\ntheir annual meeting, to the best of their\nabilities to provide investors with time to\nassess the data and make informed decisions.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. While not a voting\nitem, we find it helpful to our understanding\nof investment risk when companies disclose any\nrelevant global climate and other\nsustainability-related standards adopted, the\nindustry initiatives in which they\nparticipate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices.\n\n(9) By material sustainability-related risks\nand opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk\nand financial value creation in a company\u2019s\nbusiness model that have an environmental or\nsocial dependency or impact. Examples of\nenvironmental issues include, but are not\nlimited to, water use, land use, waste\nmanagement, and climate risk. Examples of\nsocial issues include, but are not limited to,\nhuman capital management, impacts on the\ncommunities in which a company operates,\ncustomer loyalty, and relationships with\nregulators. (10) The objective of IFRS S1\nGeneral Requirements for Disclosure of\nSustainability-related Financial Information\nis to require an entity to disclose\ninformation about its sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity. The\nobjective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-28\n\nClimate and nature-related risk In our view,\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy is one\nof several mega forces reshaping markets. (11)\nOur research shows that the low-carbon\ntransition is a structural shift in the global\neconomy that will be shaped by changes in\ngovernment policies, technology, and consumer\nand investor preferences, which may be\nmaterial for many companies. (12) Yet the path\nto a low-carbon economy is uncertain and\nuneven, with different parts of the economy\nmoving at different speeds. BIS recognizes\nthat it can be challenging for companies to\npredict the impact of climate-related risk and\nopportunity on their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term financial value to\ninvestors. At companies where these climate-\nrelated risks are material, we find it helpful\nwhen they publicly disclose, consistent with\ntheir business model and sector, how they\nintend to deliver long-term financial\nperformance through the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy, including where available,\ntheir transition plan. (13) In our experience,\ndisclosure consistent with the ISSB standards\nor the TCFD framework can help investors\nassess company-specific climate-related risks\nand opportunities, and inform investment\ndecisions. (14) Such disclosures also provide\ninvestors with insights into how companies are\nmanaging the risks associated with climate\nchange by managing their own carbon emissions\nor emissions intensities to the extent\nfinancially practicable. Recognizing the value\nof these disclosures, in some jurisdictions,\nlike the U.K, large companies must disclose\nsuch climate-related financial information on\na mandatory basis, while in other\njurisdictions these disclosures are viewed as\nbest practice in the market. Consistent with\nthe ISSB standards and the TCFD framework, we\nseek to understand, from company disclosures\nand engagement, the strategies companies have\nin place to manage material risks to, and\nopportunities for, their long-term business\nmodel associated with a range of climate-\nrelated scenarios. This includes a scenario in\nwhich global warming is limited to well below\n2\u00b0C, considering ambitions to achieve a limit\nof 1.5\u00b0C, the temperature goal recently\nreaffirmed by G20 members as part of the 2024\nLeader\u2019s Declaration. (15) These frameworks\nalso contemplate disclosures on how companies\nare setting short-, medium- and long-term\ntargets, ideally science-based where these are\navailable for their sector, for scope 1 and 2\ngreenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and\nto demonstrate how their targets are\nconsistent with the long-term financial\ninterests of their investors. While we\nrecognize that regulators in some markets are\nmoving to mandate certain disclosures, at this\nstage, we view scope 3 emissions differently\nfrom scopes 1 and 2, given methodological\ncomplexity, regulatory uncertainty, concerns\nabout double-counting, and lack of direct\ncontrol by companies. We welcome disclosures\nand commitments companies choose to make\nregarding material scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s\n\n(11) BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Mega\nforces: An investment opportunity \u201d , 2023.\n(12) BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c\nTracking the low-carbon transition \u201d , July\n2023. (13) We have observed that more\ncompanies are developing such plans, and\npublic policymakers in a number of markets are\nsignaling their intentions to require them or\nalready have requirements in place, such as\nAustralia, Brazil, and the European Union. We\nview transition plans as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate its long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. Transition plans\nare building momentum internationally, with\nincreased focus from policy makers and\nsupervisors, including in the EU, UK, G7, G20,\nand from the financial industry. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for transition plans, there is no\nconsensus on the key elements these plans\nshould contain. We view useful disclosure as\none that communicates a company\u2019s approach to\nmanaging financially material business\nrelevant risks and opportunities \u2013 including\nclimate-related risks \u2013 to deliver long-term\nfinancial performance, which allows investors\nto make more informed decisions. While\ntransition plans can be helpful disclosure,\nBIS does not make the preparation and\nproduction of transition plans a voting issue.\nBIS may engage companies that have chosen to\npublish a transition plan to understand their\nplanned actions and resource implications.\n(14) BlackRock, \u201c Global perspectives on\ninvesting in the low-carbon transition \u201d ,\nJune 2023. We recognize that companies may\nphase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years, depending on\nlocal requirements. We also recognize and\nrespect that some companies may report using\ndifferent local standards, which may be\nrequired by regulation, or one of a number of\nvoluntary standards. In such cases, we ask\nthat companies disclose their rationale for\nreporting in line with the specific disclosure\nframework chosen and highlight the metrics\nthat are industry- or company-specific. (15)\nIn November 2024, G20 members reaffirmed the\nParis Agreement temperature goal as part of\nthe Leader\u2019s Declaration . G20 members include\nthe world\u2019s major economies (19 countries and\ntwo regional bodies, the European Union and\nAfrican Union), representing 85% of global\nGross Domestic Product, over 75% of\ninternational trade, and about two-thirds of\nthe world population.\n\nA-29\n\nstrategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities. We rely on company\ndisclosures when determining how to vote on\nshareholder proposals addressing natural\ncapital issues. Our publicly available\ncommentary provides more information on our\napproach to natural capital. (16) Companies\u2019\nimpact on their workforce, supply chains, and\ncommunities In order to advance long-term\nshareholders\u2019 interests, companies should\nconsider the interests of the various parties\non whom they depend for their success over\ntime. It is for each company to determine\ntheir key stakeholders based on what is\nmaterial to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies discuss how they\nconsider the needs of their workforce today,\nand the skills required for their future\nbusiness strategy. We are also interested to\nunderstand how the board monitors and engages\non these matters, given it is well positioned\nto ensure that the approach taken by\nmanagement is informed by and aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s strategy. Companies should\narticulate how they address material adverse\nimpacts that could arise from their business\npractices and affect critical relationships\nwith their stakeholders. We encourage\ncompanies to implement, to the extent\nappropriate, monitoring processes (often\nreferred to as due diligence) to identify and\nmitigate potential adverse impacts and\ngrievance mechanisms to remediate any actual\nadverse material impacts. In our view,\nmaintaining trust within these relationships\ncan contribute to a company\u2019s long-term\nsuccess. Other corporate governance matters\nand shareholder protections In our view,\nshareholders have a right to material and\ntimely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. As a general\nprinciple, we believe shareholders should have\nthe right to vote on key corporate governance\nmatters, including changes to governance\nmechanisms, to submit proposals to the\nshareholders\u2019 meeting, and to call special\nmeetings of shareholders. Corporate form In\nour view, it is the responsibility of the\nboard to determine the corporate form that is\nmost appropriate given the company's purpose\nand business model. (17) Companies proposing\nto change their corporate form to a public\nbenefit corporation or similar entity should\nput it to a shareholder vote if not already\nrequired to do so under applicable law. We\nappreciate when supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form clearly explains\nhow the interests of shareholders and\ndifferent stakeholders would be impacted as\nwell as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. We generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis.\n\n(16) Given the growing awareness of the\nmateriality of these issues for certain\nbusinesses, enhanced reporting on a company's\nnatural capital dependencies and impacts would\naid investors\u2019 understanding. In our view, the\nfinal recommendations of the Taskforce on\nNature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD)\nmay prove useful to some companies. We\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of other\nprivate sector standards. TNFD-aligned\nreporting is not a voting issue. (17)\nCorporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-30\n\nShareholder proposals In most markets in which\nBlackRock invests on behalf of clients,\nshareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on at a company\u2019s annual\nor extraordinary meeting, as long as\neligibility and procedural requirements are\nmet. The matters that we see put forward by\nshareholders address a wide range of topics,\nincluding governance reforms, capital\nmanagement, and improvements in the management\nor disclosure of sustainability-related risks.\nBlackRock is subject to legal and regulatory\nrequirements in the U.S. that place\nrestrictions and limitations on how BlackRock\ncan interact with the companies in which we\ninvest on behalf of our clients, including our\nability to submit shareholder proposals. We\ncan vote, on behalf of clients who authorize\nus to do so, on proposals put forth by others.\nWhen assessing shareholder proposals, we\nevaluate each proposal on its merit,\nconsidering the company\u2019s individual\ncircumstances and maintaining a singular focus\non the proposal\u2019s implications for long-term\nfinancial value creation. BIS\u2019 evaluation\nconsiders whether a shareholder proposal\naddresses a material risk that, if left\nunmanaged, may impact a company\u2019s long-term\nperformance. We look for consistency between\nthe specific request formally made in the\nproposal, the supporting documentation, and\nthe proponents\u2019 other communications on the\nissues. We also assess the company\u2019s practices\nand disclosures and the costs and benefits to\nthe company of meeting the request made in the\nproposal. We take into consideration a\ncompany\u2019s governance practices and disclosures\nagainst those of their peers. In our\nexperience, it is helpful when companies\ndisclose the names of the proponent or\norganization that has submitted or advised on\nthe proposal. We would not support proposals\nthat we believe would result in over-reaching\ninto the basic business decisions of the\ncompany, are unduly prescriptive or\nconstraining on management. We take into\nconsideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. BIS is likely to support\nshareholder proposals that request disclosures\nthat help us, as long-term investors on behalf\nof our clients, better understand the material\nrisks and opportunities companies face and how\nthey are managing them, especially where this\ninformation is additive given the company\u2019s\nexisting disclosures. We may also support\nshareholder proposals that are focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation. We recognize that some shareholder\nproposals bundle topics and/or specific\nrequests. Further, the proponent\u2019s supporting\nstatement may refer to topics that are not\ndirectly related to the request made in the\nproposal. In voting on behalf of clients, we\ndo not submit or edit proposals or the\nsupporting statements \u2013 we must vote yes or no\non the proposal as phrased by the proponent.\nTherefore, when we vote in support of a\nproposal, we are not necessarily endorsing\nevery element of the proposal or the\nreasoning, objectives, or supporting statement\nof the proponent. We may support a proposal\nfor different reasons from those put forth by\nthe proponent, when we believe that, overall,\nit can advance our clients' long-term\nfinancial interests. We typically explain to\nthe company our rationale for supporting such\nproposals. Alternatively, or in addition, we\nmay vote against the election of one or more\ndirectors if, in our assessment, the board has\nnot responded sufficiently or with an\nappropriate sense of urgency to a material\nrisk. We may also support a proposal if\nmanagement is on track, but we believe that\nvoting in favor might accelerate efforts to\naddress a material risk. BlackRock\u2019s oversight\nof its investment stewardship activities\nOversight BlackRock maintains advisory\ncommittees (Stewardship Advisory Committees),\ngenerally consisting of senior BlackRock index\ninvestment professionals and/or senior\nemployees with practical boardroom experience.\nThe Stewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines). The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees, the Investment Stewardship Global\nOversight Committee (Global Oversight\nCommittee) is a risk-focused committee,\ncomprised of the Global Head of Investment\nStewardship (Global Head), and senior\nBlackRock executives with legal, risk and\nother experience relevant to team oversight.\nThe Global Committee does not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS.\n\nA-31\n\nThe Global Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines. In\naddition, the Global Committee receives and\nreviews periodic reports regarding the votes\ncast by BIS, as well as updates on material\nprocess issues, procedural changes, and other\nrisk oversight considerations. The Global\nCommittee reviews these reports in an\noversight capacity as informed by the\nGuidelines. BIS carries out engagement with\ncompanies, executes proxy votes, and conducts\nvote operations (including maintaining records\nof votes cast) in a manner consistent with the\nrelevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts\nresearch on corporate governance issues and\nparticipates in industry discussions to\ncontribute to and keep abreast of important\ndevelopments in the corporate governance\nfield. BIS may utilize third parties for\ncertain of the foregoing activities and\nperforms oversight of those third parties. BIS\nmay discuss complicated or particularly\ncontroversial matters with senior specialists\ninternally, on an advisory basis, prior to\nmaking a voting decision. Voting guidelines\nand vote execution BlackRock votes on proxy\nissues when our clients authorize us to do so.\nWe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Principles.\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. The\nGuidelines are reviewed annually and updated\nas necessary to reflect changes in market\npractices, developments in corporate\ngovernance and feedback from companies and\nclients. In this way, BIS aims to maintain\npolicies that explain our approach to\ngovernance practices most aligned with\nclients\u2019 long-term financial interests. BIS\nanalysts may exercise their professional\njudgment in determining how to vote if they\nconclude that the Guidelines do not cover the\nspecific matter raised by a ballot item or\nthat an exception to the Guidelines would be\nin the long-term economic interests of\nBlackRock\u2019s clients. In certain markets, proxy\nvoting involves logistical issues which can\naffect BIS\u2019 ability to vote such proxies, as\nwell as the desirability of voting such\nproxies. These issues include, but are not\nlimited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder\nmeetings; ii) restrictions on a foreigner\u2019s\nability to exercise votes; iii) requirements\nto vote proxies in person; iv) \u201c share-\nblocking \u201d (requirements that investors who\nexercise their voting rights surrender the\nright to dispose of their holdings for some\nspecified period in proximity to the\nshareholder meeting); v) potential\ndifficulties in translating the proxy; vi)\nregulatory constraints; and vii) requirements\nto provide local agents with unrestricted\npowers of attorney to facilitate voting\ninstructions. We are not supportive of\nimpediments to the exercise of voting rights\nsuch as share-blocking or overly burdensome\nadministrative requirements. BlackRock votes\nproxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Voting Choice BlackRock offers\nVoting Choice a program that provides eligible\nclients with more opportunities to participate\nin the proxy voting process where legally and\noperationally viable.\n\nA-32\n\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize certain\nequity index investment strategies, as well as\neligible clients in certain institutional\npooled funds in the U.S., UK, and Canada that\nuse systematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nIn addition, institutional clients in\nseparately managed accounts (SMAs) continue to\nbe eligible for BlackRock Voting Choice\nregardless of their investment strategies.\n(18) BlackRock also launched a U.S. Program to\noffer proxy voting to eligible shareholder\naccounts in a U.S. Fund. (19) As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nOur clients have greater control over proxy\nvoting because of Voting Choice. BlackRock\ndoes not disclose client information,\nincluding a client\u2019s selection of proxy\npolicy, without client consent. Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures BIS\nmaintains policies and procedures that seek to\nprevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s proxy\nvoting activity. Such influence might stem\nfrom any relationship between the investee\ncompany (or any shareholder proponent or\ndissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird- party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third-party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors\n\n(18) With Voting Choice, SMAs have the ability\nto select from a set of voting policies from\nthird-party proxy advisers the policy that\nbest aligns with their views and preferences.\nBlackRock can then use its proxy voting\ninfrastructure to cast votes based on the\nclient\u2019s selected voting policy. (19) Read\nmore about BlackRock Voting Choice on our\nwebsite .\n\nA-33\n\n\u2022 public companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary duty as an\nasset manager to our clients in helping them\nachieve their investment goals. While this has\noccurred in a limited number of cases, the\ndecision to recall securities on loan as part\nof BlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). (20) BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Reporting and vote transparency We\nare committed to transparency in the\nstewardship work we do on behalf of clients.\nWe inform clients about our engagement and\nvoting policies and activities through direct\ncommunication and through disclosure on our\nwebsite. Additionally, we make public our\nregional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals and on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant\n\n(20) Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-34\n\ninterest to clients, we may publish a vote\nbulletin after the meeting, disclosing and\nexplaining our vote on key proposals. We also\npublish a quarterly list of all companies with\nwhich we engaged and the key topics addressed\nin the engagement meeting. In this way, we\nhelp inform our clients about the work we do\non their behalf in promoting the governance\nand business practices that support durable,\nlong-term financial value creation by\ncompanies.

We consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to be an informed, engaged\nshareholder on their behalf, given the\nbusiness decisions that companies make have a\ndirect impact on our clients\u2019 long-term\ninvestment outcomes and financial well-being.\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) is a\ndedicated function within BlackRock, which\nserves as a link between BlackRock\u2019s clients\nand the companies we invest in on their\nbehalf. BIS takes a long-term approach in our\nstewardship efforts, reflecting the investment\nhorizons of the majority of our clients. BIS\ndoes this through: 1. Engaging with companies\nin a two-way dialogue to build our\nunderstanding of a company\u2019s practices and\ninform our voting decisions. 2. Voting at\nshareholder meetings on management and\nshareholder proposals on behalf of clients who\nhave delegated voting authority to BlackRock.\n3. Contributing to industry dialogue on\nstewardship to share our perspectives on\nmatters that may impact our clients\u2019\ninvestments. 4. Reporting on our activities to\ninform clients about our stewardship efforts\non their behalf through a range of\npublications and direct reporting. Stewardship\nfor clients with investment objectives\nrelating to the low-carbon transition\nBlackRock offers a wide range of investment\nproducts and funds to support our clients\u2019\nunique and varied investment objectives, and\nin February 2024, BlackRock announced it would\nbe launching a new decarbonization stewardship\noption for those clients who explicitly direct\nBlackRock to invest their assets with\ndecarbonization investment objectives. An\nincreasing number of clients are seeking to\nminimize the financial risk, and maximize the\nfinancial opportunities, associated with the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, and thus\nare interested in sustainable and transition\ninvesting, with some including decarbonization\nas an investment objective in their mandates\nwith BlackRock. In Europe for example, all of\nour largest, strategic relationship clients\nhave net zero commitments for their\norganizations, and globally a growing number\nhave made similar commitments, which those\nclients believe, will shape financial\nopportunities in the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy. A survey of 200 institutional\ninvestors globally, representing nearly $9tn\nin assets under management, indicated that 98%\nof them have set some kind of transition\ninvestment objective for their portfolios.\nThese guidelines set out BIS\u2019 approach to\nvoting at companies\u2019 shareholder meetings on\nbehalf of funds with explicit decarbonization\nor climate-related investment objectives, and,\nwhen appropriate, engagement with corporate\nleadership to support our voting on clients\u2019\nbehalf. In addition, clients in separately\nmanaged accounts may instruct BlackRock to\napply these guidelines to their holdings. Both\nin the case of funds and separately managed\naccounts, these guidelines are only\nimplemented upon explicit selection and\napproval by the applicable fund board or\nclient. These guidelines should be read in\nconjunction with BIS\u2019 benchmark policies and\nare focused on matters related to climate\nrisks and the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy at companies that are held by funds\nand clients who have selected these\nguidelines. These guidelines differ from the\nbenchmark policies in that they consider, in\naddition to financial considerations and\nconsistent with the investment objective of\neach fund or account that has selected these\nguidelines, the alignment of companies\u2019\nbusiness model and strategies with the\nfinancial opportunities presented by the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy and the\nmore ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement,\nnamely to limit average temperature rise to\n1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. These\nguidelines will apply to companies which\nproduce goods and services that contribute to\nreal world decarbonization or have a carbon\nintensive business model and face outsized\nimpacts from the low-carbon transition, based\non reported and estimated scopes 1, 2, and 3\ngreenhouse gas emissions. We estimate these\ncompanies represent the vast majority of the\n\nA-36\n\nvalue chain emissions of the companies held by\nfunds and clients that have selected these\nguidelines. For all other companies held by\nthese funds and clients, BIS\u2019 benchmark voting\nguidelines apply. On other matters not related\nto climate risks and the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy, BIS will apply our benchmark\npolicies. For clients who have not directed\nBlackRock to prioritize climate risks and\ndecarbonization as an investment objective,\nBIS will continue to undertake our stewardship\nresponsibilities in line with our benchmark\npolicies, with a sole focus on advancing those\nclients\u2019 long-term economic interests. This\nwill include consideration of climate-related\nrisks and opportunities in a company\u2019s\nbusiness model, where material to the\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver long-term\nfinancial returns. Please see appendix 2,\nwhich sets out the key differences between the\nBIS benchmark and decarbonization policies on\nitems related to climate risk and the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy.\nUnderstanding the investment implications of\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy\nResearch from the BlackRock Investment\nInstitute (BII) highlights that changing\ngovernment policy, technology, and consumer\nand investor preferences are driving the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, but these\nforces are moving at uneven speeds across\nsectors and regions. For example\u2014some\ntechnologies like renewable power are already\nbeing deployed at scale in some regions, while\nin other sectors and regions less cost-\neffective low-carbon alternatives exist. We\nhave heard from certain clients that they see\nthe low-carbon transition as a series of\nshifts over decades that will reshape\nproduction and consumption, spur significant\ncapital investment and create risks,\nopportunities and a wider range of financial\nand competitive outcomes for companies. For\nclients interested in investing in the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy and\nunderstanding its corresponding risks and\nopportunities, we have developed the BlackRock\nInvestment Institute Transition Scenario\n(BIITS), powered by Aladdin \u00ae technology.\nBIITS is a research-based, analytical forecast\nof how the low-carbon transition is most\nlikely to play out based on what we know and\nexpect today. It can help inform a top-down\nassessment of a company\u2019s business risk\narising from the transition. BII based its key\nassumptions on rigorous research, and the\ninput of BlackRock\u2019s portfolio managers and\nother experts. For client assets with explicit\ninvestment objectives related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, BIS will\ndraw on the insights generated by BIITS and\nAladdin \u00ae Climate, as well as our own analysis\nand engagement, in applying these guidelines.\nIn doing so, we will take into consideration\nthe fact that the necessary data to assess\nindividual companies currently has\nlimitations, but is improving as a result of\ndisclosure requirements in an increasing\nnumber of jurisdictions. Decarbonization\nstewardship guidelines design principles The\nframework of these guidelines is designed to:\n\u2022 Prioritize sectors and companies that are\ncritical to the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy: This includes companies which produce\ngoods and services that contribute to real\nworld decarbonization or have a carbon\nintensive business model and face outsized\nimpacts from the low-carbon transition. \u2022\nApply a sectoral approach to our analysis that\nacknowledges the unevenness of the low-carbon\ntransition across sectors and markets: We take\ninto consideration the varying speeds at which\nsectors and markets can decarbonize based on\ntechnological feasibility, consumer demand,\ngovernment policy, regulatory frameworks and\nother factors. Further, we recognize that\nthese factors are uncertain and dynamic, which\nwill require that we evolve our approach as\nnecessary. \u2022 Take a long-term, pragmatic\napproach that favors a transition that\nminimizes disruption to companies and their\nkey stakeholders: Our approach recognizes the\nchallenges that many companies face in\nadapting their business models. It is premised\non the views of interested clients that a\ntransition where companies adapt and continue\nto deliver financial returns throughout, is a\nbetter long-term investment outcome for them,\nand less disruptive to a company\u2019s other key\nstakeholders, than a transition that is\nuneven. Further, we consider the differences\nbetween the actions and outcomes over which\ncompany management has influence, and those it\ndoes not. \u2022 Focus on useful, contextualized\ndisclosures that help inform investors views,\nwhile recognizing data limitations: The policy\nwill seek disclosures that outline key\nmilestones and dependencies underpinning the\ncompany\u2019s low-carbon transition strategy;\nexplain the trade-offs required to adapt the\nbusiness model; and include relevant data and\nnarrative.\n\nA-37\n\n\u2022 Be consistent with our position as a\nminority investor on behalf of our clients:\nThe boards and executive leadership of\ncompanies determine a company\u2019s strategy and\nits implementation. We make decisions on how\nto engage companies and vote proxies\nindependently, based on our professional\njudgment of the priorities and outcomes most\naligned with clients\u2019 investment objectives.\nVoting guidelines Consistent with the\ninvestment objective of each fund or client\nthat has selected these guidelines, BIS will\nlook to companies to demonstrate the\nfollowing: Corporate Disclosures In the\ncontext of these guidelines, we look for\ncompanies to provide sufficient corporate\ndisclosure to allow us to determine the extent\nto which decarbonization and the low-carbon\ntransition are strategic priorities. As a\ngeneral point, we would expect companies that\nhave disclosed their aim to participate in the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy to make\ndisclosures that help explain the strategy and\ngovernance systems they have determined most\nappropriate, which may include: (1) a low-\ncarbon transition strategy to demonstrate\ntheir alignment with the ambition to limit\nglobal average temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above\npre-industrial levels. This would normally\nmean that they have a long-term strategy to\nachieve net- zero greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions by 2050, with appropriate near- and\nmedium-term milestones to assess their\nprogress. (2) low-carbon transition-related\nreporting consistent with the standards\ndeveloped by the International Sustainability\nStandards Board (ISSB). IFRS S1 addresses the\ngeneral requirements of sustainability\nreporting and IFRS S2 sets out the disclosures\nthat would provide investors with decision-\nuseful information about a company\u2019s most\nsignificant climate- and low-carbon\ntransition-related risks and opportunities. As\naudit and assurance standards are developed,\nit would be helpful to investors\u2019 confidence\nin such disclosures for companies to seek\nindependent, third-party assurance. (3) scope\n1 and scope 2, and material scope 3 GHG\nemissions. In addition, we look to companies\nto disclose their reduction targets for scope\n1 and 2 emissions, science-based where\npossible. We welcome disclosure of targets or\nindicative goals, where companies have set\nthem, for scope 3 emissions reductions,\nrecognizing that these would be provided on a\n\u2018best efforts\u2019 basis given the methodological\nchallenges these currently present for\nreporters. Scope 3 information, including how\na company is working with its value chain to\naccelerate reductions in GHG intensity,\nprovides useful insight to investors focused\non investing in the low-carbon transition and\nunderstanding the impact of their investments\non their decarbonization goals. However, we\nrecognize that companies have varying ability\nto influence the emissions across the\ndifferent parts of their value chain and it is\nhelpful when disclosures explain the\nimplications for the achievement of their\ndecarbonization targets. Transition plans Some\ncompanies have published a transition plan\nthat explains how the company intends to\nimplement its low-carbon transition strategy\nby, as defined by the ISSB, \u201c lay[ing] out the\nentity\u2019s targets, actions or resources for its\ntransition towards a lower-carbon economy,\nincluding actions such as reducing its\ngreenhouse gas emissions \u201d (see appendix 1).\nWe note the work being undertaken in a number\nof jurisdictions on establishing a common\napproach in a market to corporate transition\nplans. Given this work continues, for the\nnear-term, BIS will not make preparation and\nproduction of transition plans a voting issue.\nBIS may engage companies that have chosen to\npublish a transition plan to understand their\nplanned actions and resource implications in\naccordance with anticipated requirements.\nBoards and directors An effective and well-\nfunctioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the company\u2019s\nability to deliver on its low-carbon\ntransition strategy. In assessing the role and\neffectiveness of the board in this regard, we\nseek to understand whether: \u2022 The board has\nclear oversight responsibilities for climate\nand low-carbon transition-related risks and\nopportunities in the company\u2019s business model.\nWe consider the whole board to have\nresponsibility for oversight of the company\u2019s\nlong- term strategy, including those aspects\nrelated to the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy.\n\nA-38\n\n\u2022 Management has established a robust low-\ncarbon transition framework and long-term\nstrategy, with clear accountability for\ndelivery by senior executives. \u2022 The capital\nmanagement strategy explains how the company\nallocates investments to (traditional and next\ngeneration) business lines and innovation, and\nreturns cash to shareholders, consistent with\nthe low-carbon transition strategy. \u2022 The\nclimate and low-carbon transition risks most\nlikely to significantly impact the business\nare integrated into the company\u2019s enterprise\nrisk management processes and reporting. \u2022 The\ncompany has set scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions\nreduction targets, science-based and\nindependently verified where possible, against\na baseline, that are consistent with the\nambition to limit average temperature rise to\nno more than 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial\nlevels. \u2022 There is a clear link between the\ncompany\u2019s scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions reduction\ntargets over time and its long-term low-carbon\ntransition strategy. \u2022 The company is\nmonitoring its material scope 3 emissions and\ndisclosing these where it is confident in the\ndata. Given forthcoming regulatory\nrequirements in certain jurisdictions, some\ncompanies are voluntarily disclosing scope 3\nemissions reductions targets and plans,\nsetting out how they are working on\ndecarbonization with the different\nconstituents in their value chain. \u2022 The board\noversees, and management has a formalized\napproach to, the company\u2019s lobbying\nactivities, including trade association\nmemberships. Policy engagement should be\nconsistent with a company\u2019s stated strategic\npolicy objectives, including those related to\nthe low-carbon transition. Voting against\ndirectors over concerns about climate risk In\nimplementing these guidelines, BIS will\ngenerally support non-executive directors\nstanding for election where, in BIS\u2019\nassessment based on company disclosures and\nengagement, a company is executing on its\ncommitment to align with the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy, as defined above. Where\nBIS determines this is not the case, we may\nvote against the election of one or more\ndirectors who have responsibility for the\nissue. The directors most likely to be in\nfocus are the chair of the board sub-committee\nwith low-carbon transition, climate or\nsustainability risk oversight\nresponsibilities, other members of the\nrelevant committee, the lead independent\ndirector or the non-executive chair of the\nboard. In certain markets, we may withhold\nsupport for the discharge of the supervisory\nboard or equivalent. Where we have not\nsupported director elections over climate\nconcerns in a prior year, and the company has\nnot subsequently made progress towards\naligning with the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy, we may escalate by voting against the\nre-election of additional responsible\ndirectors to signal our heightened concerns.\nManagement proposals to approve a climate\nstrategy or progress report In certain\nmarkets, company management may submit\nproposals asking shareholders to approve their\nclimate action plans or progress reports,\nsometimes known as \u201c Say on Climate. \u201d BIS\nwill generally support management\u2019s climate\nstrategy proposal if, in our assessment based\non these guidelines, the strategy is aligned\nwith the low-carbon transition. Similarly, we\nwill generally support management\u2019s proposal\non a progress report if the company has\nclearly explained its progress against, and\nany deviations from or changes to, its stated\ntransition plan and targets. Shareholder\nproposals on climate and low-carbon transition\nmatters Shareholder proposals on a company\u2019s\napproach to the low-carbon transition or\nclimate risk will be considered on their\nmerit. Our assessment will take into\nconsideration the implications for, and the\nrelevance to, the company\u2019s stated low-carbon\ntransition strategy and targets. We may\nsupport shareholder proposals that, for\nexample, ask a company to: \u2022 Publish a\nbusiness plan, and related disclosures,\nconsistent with the ambition to limit average\ntemperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C above\npre-industrial levels \u2022 Align their scope 1\nand 2 GHG emissions reduction targets to,\nand/or discuss how their targets align with, a\nlong-term goal of the company achieving net\nzero GHG emissions by 2050 \u2022 Disclose the\ncategories of scope 3 GHG emissions most\nmaterial to a company\u2019s business model \u2022\nImprove disclosures on how a company\u2019s\nclimate-related lobbying (including trade\nassociation memberships and other indirect\nlobbying) is aligned with its strategic policy\npositions.\n\nA-39\n\nWe would not support shareholder proposals\nthat seek to constrain board or management\ndecision-making or direct specific business or\nstrategic decisions. This includes proposals\nthat seek to change a company\u2019s articles of\nassociation or charter to require commitments\nor actions related to climate risk or the low-\ncarbon transition. Related matters There are\nother business items not covered above that\nmay be put to a shareholder vote that could\naddress matters relevant to the transition to\na low-carbon economy. Under these guidelines,\nBIS is most likely to engage, where\nappropriate, if we seek to enhance our\nunderstanding of a company\u2019s approach.\nGenerally, our voting on these matters would\nbe covered by BIS\u2019 benchmark guidelines.\nExecutive compensation We look to company\nboards to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. Some companies, in\nlight of their long-term strategy, may decide\nto include relevant GHG emissions reduction\ntargets or low-carbon transition-related\nmetrics in their incentive plans. In such\ncases, BIS would engage to understand the\nalignment between those metrics and the\ncompany\u2019s stated climate strategy. Auditors\nand audit-related issues For companies with\nmaterial climate or transition risks or\nopportunities in their business models, BIS is\ninterested to understand whether the company\nconsiders and, if relevant, quantifies, and\naccounts for material climate-related risks in\nits financial statements, including if the\ncompany explains such risks within the context\nof its audit report. We note that work is\nbeing undertaken to develop audit and\nassurance standards in relation to climate and\ntransition reporting, which may impact the\nfuture reporting requirements of companies. We\nnote that assurance of corporate disclosures\nrelated to climate risk and the transition to\na low-carbon economy is still nascent.\nMergers, acquisitions, asset sales, and other\nspecial situations Special situations will be\nconsidered on their financial merits, but BIS\nmay engage on climate-related factors under\nthese guidelines where a transaction may\nsignificantly alter a company\u2019s climate\nstrategy or a shareholder activist has\nproposed governance, strategic or operational\nchanges that may impact its climate strategy.\nBIS does not promote changes in corporate\ncontrol, nor does it invoke formal governance\nmechanisms that rise to the level of\nshareholder activism. Other business relevant\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nClimate risk and the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy are interconnected with a\nnumber of other sustainability-related risks\nand opportunities that may be relevant to a\ncompany\u2019s business model and long-term\nperformance. These include a company\u2019s impacts\nor dependencies on natural capital and key\nstakeholders. In the context of these\nguidelines, we may engage companies to better\nunderstand how they are managing the impact on\npeople (e.g., employees, suppliers, customers\nand communities) of any strategic or\noperational changes they are making in\nrelation to their transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Similarly, we may engage companies\nthat face risks and opportunities related to\nland use and deforestation, access to fresh\nwater, or the ability to secure scarce\nresources critical to the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy. Appendix 1 Terminology We\nunderstand the key concepts referred to within\nthese guidelines as follows: Climate risk:\nIncludes physical risk, the increased risk to\ncompanies\u2019 assets and activities caused by the\ndirect impact of changing weather patterns and\nnatural catastrophes, and transition risk, the\nimpact of the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy on a company\u2019s long-term\nprofitability. Transition to a low-carbon\neconomy ( \u201c low-carbon transition \u201d ): The\nglobal economic shift toward lower emissions\nacross many sectors and business models. The\neconomic transformation is being driven by\nchanges in government policy, technology, and\nconsumer and investor preferences, as well as\nthe physical effects of climate change (e.g.,\nextreme weather), and can potentially have a\nmaterial impact on clients\u2019 investments and\nportfolios.\n\nA-40\n\nDecarbonization: the process of reducing or\neliminating emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2)\nfrom human activity and removing carbon\ncurrently in the atmosphere. This can be\ncarried out by countries, companies and even\nindividual consumers. Sometimes the concept is\nunderstood to include the reduction and\nelimination of other GHG, e.g., methane.\nClimate-related risks and opportunities: The\ninvestment opportunities and risks associated\nwith the transition to a low-carbon economy,\nincluding transition risks and opportunities\nand physical risks and opportunities in\nadapting to physical climate change. Climate-\nrelated transition plan: \u201c An aspect of an\nentity\u2019s overall strategy that lays out the\nentity\u2019s targets, actions or resources for its\ntransition towards a lower-carbon economy,\nincluding actions such as reducing its\ngreenhouse gas emissions. \u201d Science-based GHG\nemissions reduction targets: Targets that \u201c\n\u2026are in line with what the latest climate\nscience deems necessary to meet the goals of\nthe Paris Agreement \u2013 limiting global warming\nto 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Science-\nbased targets give companies a clearly defined\npath to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in\nline with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\nThey define how much and how quickly a\nbusiness must reduce its emissions to be in\nline with the Paris Agreement goals. \u201d\nAppendix 2 Comparison of key differences\nbetween how the BIS benchmark considers\nclimate-related risks, where appropriate, and\nthe decarbonization guidelines\n                                              \n                BIS Benchmark  Decarbonizat\u2026  \n                Policy         Policy         \n                               Considers      \n                               both           \n                Focuses on     financial      \n                financial      performance    \n                performance    anddecarboni\u2026  \n                andengages     objectives     \n                companies on   consistent     \n                climate        withfunds'     \n                andtransition  and clients'   \n                topics when    investment     \n                material to    objectivesAs\u2026  \n  Key concepts  theirbusiness  the alignment  \n                Prioritizes    of a           \n                the            company'sbus\u2026  \n                disclosure of  model with     \n                how acompany   the ambition   \n                is managing    to             \n                material       limitglobal    \n                climate        average        \n                andtransitio\u2026  temperature    \n                risks and      rise to        \n                opportunities  1.5\u00b0Cabove     \n                               pre-industri\u2026  \n                               levels         \n                               Largest total  \n  Prioritized   Largest Scope  value chain    \n  companies     1 and 2 GHG    GHG            \n  forclimate-\u2026  emitters       emitters(Sco\u2026  \n                               1, 2, & 3)     \n                Seeks          Seeks          \n  Emissions     reporting of   reporting of   \n  reporting     Scope 1 & 2    Scope 1, 2     \n                               and material3  \n  Emissions     Seeks the      Seeks Scope 1  \n  targets       disclosure of  & 2 targets    \n  &decarboniz\u2026  Scope 1 & 2    and            \n  efforts       targets        assessesdeca\u2026  \n                               efforts        \n                Seeks                         \n                disclosure     Assesses       \n  Temperature   from           temperature    \n  &             companies      and            \n  scenarioali\u2026  thatidentifi\u2026  scenarioalig\u2026  \n  /             and discusses  to 1.5\u00b0C       \n  pathways      the most       degrees        \n                plausibledec\u2026                 \n                pathway                       \n                               Seeks          \n                               science-based  \n                Engagement     targets        \n  Science-bas\u2026  topic but not  andverificat\u2026  \n  targetscomm\u2026  vote           where          \n  &verificati\u2026  escalationcr\u2026  possible; may  \n                               takevoting     \n                               action where   \n                               absent         \n                               Assesses       \n                               activities     \n                Engagement     benefitting    \n  Company\u2019s     topic but not  from           \n  role in       vote           and/orcontri\u2026  \n  thetransiti\u2026  escalationcr\u2026  to the         \n                               transition to  \n                               a low-carbon   \n                               economy        \n                Case-by-case   Case-by-case   \n                approach with  approach with  \n                focus          furtherconsi\u2026  \n                onimplicatio\u2026  given to       \n                for long-term  decarbonizat\u2026  \n                financial      in addition    \n  Shareholder   valuecreatio\u2026  to             \n  proposals     support for    financialper\u2026  \n                shareholder    support for    \n                proposals      shareholder    \n                thatseek to    proposals      \n                direct         thatseek to    \n                management     direct         \n                strategy       management     \n                               strategy       \n                                              \nA-41\n\nWant to know more? blackrock.com/stewardship |\ncontactstewardship@blackrock.com This document\nis provided for information and educational\npurposes only.

While NRSROs may from time\nto time revise such ratings, they undertake no\nobligation to do so, and the ratings given to\nsecurities at issuance do not necessarily\nrepresent ratings which would be given to\nthese securities on a particular subsequent\ndate. NRSROs may rate specific investments (\ne.g. , bonds), issuers ( e.g. , corporations,\ngovernments and financial institutions) and/or\nprograms ( e.g. , commercial paper programs).\nHowever, certain types of investments may not\nbe rated by NRSROs, such as certain\ngovernment/sovereign obligations, US agency\nsecurities, commercial paper, time deposits at\nfinancial institutions, and derivative\ninstruments such as credit default swaps. For\nthese types of investments, as well as US\nTreasury securities (some of which are not\nrated), where a NRSRO has not rated the\nspecific investment but has rated the\ninvestment\u2019s issuer, program, financial\ninstitution or underlying reference asset, BFA\nmay consider the investment to have the same\nNRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial\ninstitution or underlying reference asset, as\napplicable. In the case of municipal\nsecurities, where one NRSRO provides multiple\nratings for the same security ( e.g. , \u201c\nunderlying, \u201d \u201c insured \u201d and/or \u201c enhanced \u201d\nratings), BFA may consider the security to\nhave the highest of the multiple ratings. New\nissue securities (regardless of type) may not\nbe rated by a NRSRO at the time of their\ninitial offering. Preliminary prospectuses or\nterm sheets for new issue securities may\ninclude an expected rating for the security\n(as determined by the underwriter and/or\nissuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of\nthe security. If applicable, when deciding\nwhether to purchase a new issue security that\nhas not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may\nattribute an expected rating to the security\nbased on: (i) the expected rating of the\nsecurity set forth in the preliminary\nprospectus or term sheet for the security;\n(ii) the NRSRO\u2019s rating for the issuer of the\nsecurity set forth in the preliminary\nprospectus or term sheet for the security; or\n(iii) with respect to asset-backed securities,\nthe rating of a prior issuance having a\nsimilar structure or the same sponsor. Where\nthe investment objective of the Fund is to\ntrack the performance of an index that\nincludes credit ratings eligibility criteria\nas part of its index methodology, the Fund may\npurchase any security within the index, such\nsecurity having been determined by the index\nprovider as meeting its credit ratings\neligibility criteria. The credit ratings\npractices of an index provider may differ from\nBlackRock\u2019s practices, as described above.\nFurther, the Fund may invest, directly or\nindirectly, in securities that are not rated\nby a rating agency or securities with a credit\nrating that differs from the credit rating\nspecified in its index methodology in various\ncircumstances, including where a security is\ndowngraded but not yet removed from an index,\nfollowing the removal of a security from an\nindex prior to its sale by the Fund or as a\nresult of a corporate action or restructuring\naffecting an issuer of a security held by the\nFund. Fixed-income securities which are\nunrated may expose the investor to risks with\nrespect to capacity to pay interest or repay\nprincipal which are similar to the risks of\nlower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of\nthese securities is dependent on the\ninvestment adviser\u2019s judgment, analysis and\nexperience in the evaluation of such\nsecurities. Investors should note that the\nassignment of a rating to a security by an\nNRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent\ndevelopments on the issuer\u2019s ability to make\ninterest and principal payments or on the\nlikelihood of default. Securities deemed to be\nhigh yield are rated below Baa3 by Moody\u2019s and\nbelow BBB- by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch.\nThe descriptions below relate to general long-\nterm and short-term obligations of an issuer.\nMoody\u2019s Ratings Long-Term Obligations Aaa:\nObligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the\nhighest quality, subject to the lowest level\nof credit risk. Aa: Obligations rated Aa are\njudged to be of high quality and are subject\nto very low credit risk. A: Obligations rated\nA are judged to be upper-medium grade and are\nsubject to low credit risk. Baa: Obligations\nrated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and\nsubject to moderate credit risk and as such\nmay possess certain speculative\ncharacteristics.\n\nB-1\n\nBa: Obligations rated Ba are judged to be\nspeculative and are subject to substantial\ncredit risk. B: Obligations rated B are\nconsidered speculative and are subject to high\ncredit risk. Caa: Obligations rated Caa are\njudged to be speculative, of poor standing and\nare subject to very high credit risk. Ca:\nObligations rated Ca are highly speculative\nand are likely in, or very near, default, with\nsome prospect of recovery of principal and\ninterest. C: Obligations rated C are the\nlowest rated and are typically in default,\nwith little prospect for recovery of principal\nor interest. Note: Moody's appends numerical\nmodifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating\nclassification from Aa through Caa. The\nmodifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks\nin the higher end of its generic rating\ncategory; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range\nranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a\nranking in the lower end of that generic\nrating category. Absence of Rating: Where no\nrating has been assigned or where a rating has\nbeen withdrawn, it may be for reasons\nunrelated to the creditworthiness of the\nissue. Should no rating be assigned, the\nreason may be one of the following: 1. An\napplication was not received or accepted. 2.\nThe issue or issuer belongs to a group of\nsecurities or entities that are not rated as a\nmatter of policy. 3. There is a lack of\nessential data pertaining to the issue or\nissuer. 4. The issue was privately placed, in\nwhich case the rating is not published in\nMoody\u2019s publications. Withdrawal may occur if\nnew and material circumstances arise, the\neffects of which preclude satisfactory\nanalysis; if there is no longer available\nreasonable up-to-date data to permit a\njudgment to be formed; if a bond is called for\nredemption; or for other reasons. Short-Term\nObligations Moody\u2019s short-term debt ratings\nare opinions of the ability of issuers to\nhonor short-term financial obligations,\ngenerally with an original maturity not\nexceeding thirteen months. Moody's employs the\nfollowing designations to indicate the\nrelative repayment ability of rated issuers:\nP-1: Issuers (or supporting institutions)\nrated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay\nshort-term debt obligations. P-2: Issuers (or\nsupporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a\nstrong ability to repay short-term debt\nobligations. P-3: Issuers (or supporting\ninstitutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable\nability to repay short-term obligations. NP:\nIssuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not\nPrime do not fall within any of the Prime\nrating categories. US Municipal Short-Term\nDebt Obligations There are three rating\ncategories for short-term municipal\nobligations that are considered investment-\ngrade and are designated as Municipal\nInvestment Grade (MIG). In addition, those\nshort-term obligations that are of speculative\nquality are designated SG, or speculative\ngrade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of\nthe obligation. MIG 1: This designation\ndenotes superior credit quality. Excellent\nprotection is afforded by established cash\nflows, highly reliable liquidity support, or\ndemonstrated broad-based access to the market\nfor refinancing. MIG 2: This designation\ndenotes strong credit quality. Margins of\nprotection are ample, although not as large as\nin the preceding group. MIG 3: This\ndesignation denotes acceptable credit quality.\nLiquidity and cash-flow protection may be\nnarrow, and market access for refinancing is\nlikely to be less well-established.\n\nB-2\n\nSG: This designation denotes speculative-grade\ncredit quality. Debt instruments in this\ncategory may lack sufficient margins of\nprotection. S&P Global Ratings Long-Term\nObligations AAA: An obligation rated AAA has\nthe highest rating assigned by S&P Global\nRatings. The obligor\u2019s capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation is\nextremely strong. AA: An obligation rated AA\ndiffers from the highest-rated obligations\nonly to a small degree. The obligor\u2019s capacity\nto meet its financial commitment is very\nstrong. A: An obligation rated A is somewhat\nmore susceptible to the adverse effects of\nchanges in circumstances and economic\nconditions than obligations in higher-rated\ncategories. However, the obligor\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial commitment on the\nobligation is still strong. BBB: An obligation\nrated BBB exhibits adequate protection\nparameters. However, adverse economic\nconditions or changing circumstances are more\nlikely to lead to a weakened capacity of the\nobligor to meet its financial commitment on\nthe obligation. BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:\nObligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are\nregarded as having significant speculative\ncharacteristics. BB indicates the least degree\nof speculation and C the highest. While such\nobligations will likely have some quality and\nprotective characteristics, these may be\noutweighed by large uncertainties or major\nexposures to adverse conditions. BB: An\nobligation rated BB is less vulnerable to\nnonpayment than other speculative issues.\nHowever, it faces major ongoing uncertainties\nor exposure to adverse business, financial, or\neconomic conditions which could lead to the\nobligor\u2019s inadequate capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation. B: An\nobligation rated B is more vulnerable to\nnonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the\nobligor currently has the capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation.\nAdverse business, financial, or economic\nconditions will likely impair the obligor\u2019s\ncapacity or willingness to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. CCC: An\nobligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable\nto nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable\nbusiness, financial, and economic conditions\nfor the obligor to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. In the event of\nadverse business, financial, or economic\nconditions, the obligor is not likely to have\nthe capacity to meet its financial commitment\non the obligation. CC: An obligation rated CC\nis currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.\nThe CC rating is used when a default has not\nyet occurred, but S&P Global Ratings expects\ndefault to be a virtual certainty, regardless\nof the anticipated time to default. C: An\nobligation rated C is currently highly\nvulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation\nis expected to have lower relative seniority\nor lower ultimate recovery compared to\nobligations that are rated higher. D: An\nobligation rated D is in default or in breach\nof an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital\ninstruments, the D rating category is used\nwhen payments on an obligation are not made on\nthe date due, unless S&P Global Ratings\nbelieves that such payments will be made\nwithin five business days in the absence of a\nstated grace period or within the earlier of\nthe stated grace period or 30 calendar days.\nThe D rating also will be used upon the filing\nof a bankruptcy petition or the taking of\nsimilar action and where default on an\nobligation is a virtual certainty, for example\ndue to automatic stay provisions. An\nobligation's rating is lowered to D if it is\nsubject to a distressed exchange offer. NR: NR\nindicates no rating has been requested, or\nthat there is insufficient information on\nwhich to base a rating, or that S&P Global\nRatings does not rate a particular obligation\nas a matter of policy. Note: The ratings from\nAA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a\nplus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative\nstanding within the major rating categories.\nShort-Term Obligations\n\nB-3\n\nA-1: A short-term obligation rated A-1 is\nrated in the highest category by S&P Global\nRatings. The obligor's capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation is\nstrong. Within this category, certain\nobligations are designated with a plus sign\n(+). This indicates that the obligor's\ncapacity to meet its financial commitment on\nthese obligations is extremely strong. A-2: A\nshort-term obligation rated A-2 is somewhat\nmore susceptible to the adverse effects of\nchanges in circumstances and economic\nconditions than obligations in higher rating\ncategories. However, the obligor's capacity to\nmeet its financial commitment on the\nobligation is satisfactory. A-3: A short-term\nobligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate\nprotection parameters. However, adverse\neconomic conditions or changing circumstances\nare more likely to lead to a weakened capacity\nof the obligor to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. B: A short-term\nobligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable\nand has significant speculative\ncharacteristics. The obligor currently has the\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments;\nhowever, it faces major ongoing uncertainties\nwhich could lead to the obligor's inadequate\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments. C:\nA short-term obligation rated C is currently\nvulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon\nfavorable business, financial, and economic\nconditions for the obligor to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation. D: A\nshort-term obligation rated D is in default or\nin breach of an imputed promise. For non-\nhybrid capital instruments, the D rating\ncategory is used when payments on an\nobligation are not made on the date due,\nunless S&P Global Ratings believes that such\npayments will be made within any stated grace\nperiod. However, any stated grace period\nlonger than five business days will be treated\nas five business days. The D rating also will\nbe used upon the filing of a bankruptcy\npetition or the taking of a similar action and\nwhere default on an obligation is a virtual\ncertainty, for example due to automatic stay\nprovisions. An obligation's rating is lowered\nto D if it is subject to a distressed exchange\noffer. Municipal Short-Term Obligations An S&P\nU.S. municipal note rating reflects S&P Global\nRatings opinion about the liquidity factors\nand market access risks unique to the notes.\nNotes due in three years or less will likely\nreceive a note rating. Notes with an original\nmaturity of more than three years will most\nlikely receive a long-term debt rating. SP-1:\nStrong capacity to pay principal and interest.\nAn issue determined to possess a very strong\ncapacity to pay debt service is given a plus\n(+) designation. SP-2: Satisfactory capacity\nto pay principal and interest, with some\nvulnerability to adverse financial and\neconomic changes over the term of the notes.\nSP-3: Speculative capacity to pay principal\nand interest. Fitch Ratings Long-Term\nObligations AAA: Highest credit quality. AAA\nratings denote the lowest expectation of\ncredit risk. They are assigned only in cases\nof exceptionally strong capacity for payment\nof financial commitments. This capacity is\nhighly unlikely to be adversely affected by\nforeseeable events. AA: Very high credit\nquality. AA ratings denote expectations of\nvery low credit risk. They indicate very\nstrong capacity for payment of financial\ncommitments. This capacity is not\nsignificantly vulnerable to foreseeable\nevents. A: High credit quality. A ratings\ndenote expectations of low credit risk. The\ncapacity for payment of financial commitments\nis considered strong. This capacity may,\nnevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse\nbusiness or economic conditions than is the\ncase for higher ratings. BBB: Good credit\nquality. BBB ratings indicate that\nexpectations of credit risk are currently low.\nThe capacity for payment of financial\ncommitments is considered adequate but adverse\nbusiness or economic conditions are more\nlikely to impair this capacity.\n\nB-4\n\nBB: Speculative. BB ratings indicate an\nelevated vulnerability to credit risk,\nparticularly in the event of adverse changes\nin business or economic conditions over time;\nhowever, business or financial alternatives\nmay be available to allow financial\ncommitments to be met. B: Highly speculative.\nB ratings indicate that material credit risk\nis present. CCC: Substantial credit risk. CCC\nratings indicate that substantial credit risk\nis present. CC: Very high levels of credit\nrisk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of\ncredit risk. C: Exceptionally high levels of\ncredit risk. C indicates exceptionally high\nlevels of credit risk. Defaulted obligations\ntypically are not assigned RD or D ratings,\nbut are instead rated in the B to C rating\ncategories, depending upon their recovery\nprospects and other relevant characteristics.\nThis approach better aligns obligations that\nhave comparable overall expected loss but\nvarying vulnerability to default and loss.\nNote: The modifiers \u201c + \u201d or \u201c - \u201d may be\nappended to a rating to denote relative status\nwithin major rating categories. Such suffixes\nare not added to the AAA obligation rating\ncategory, or to corporate finance obligation\nratings in the categories below CCC. The\nsubscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to\ndenote embedded market risk which is beyond\nthe scope of the rating. The designation is\nintended to make clear that the rating solely\naddresses the counterparty risk of the issuing\nbank. It is not meant to indicate any\nlimitation in the analysis of the counterparty\nrisk, which in all other respects follows\npublished Fitch criteria for analyzing the\nissuing financial institution. Fitch does not\nrate these instruments where the principal is\nto any degree subject to market risk. Short-\nTerm Obligations (Corporate and Public\nFinance) A short-term issuer or obligation\nrating is based in all cases on the short-term\nvulnerability to default of the rated entity\nor security stream and relates to the capacity\nto meet financial obligations in accordance\nwith the documentation governing the relevant\nobligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to\nobligations whose initial maturity is viewed\nas \u201c short-term \u201d based on market convention.\nTypically, this means up to 13 months for\ncorporate, sovereign, and structured\nobligations, and up to 36 months for\nobligations in U.S. public finance markets.\nF1: Highest short-term credit quality.\nIndicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for\ntimely payment of financial commitments; may\nhave an added \u201c + \u201d to denote any\nexceptionally strong credit feature. F2: Good\nshort-term credit quality. Good intrinsic\ncapacity for timely payment of financial\ncommitments. F3: Fair short-term credit\nquality. The intrinsic capacity for timely\npayment of financial commitments is adequate.\nB: Speculative short-term credit quality.\nMinimal capacity for timely payment of\nfinancial commitments, plus heightened\nvulnerability to near term adverse changes in\nfinancial and economic conditions. C: High\nshort-term default risk. Default is a real\npossibility. RD: Restricted default. Indicates\nan entity that has defaulted on one or more of\nits financial commitments, although it\ncontinues to meet other financial obligations.\nTypically applicable to entity ratings only.\nD: Default. Indicates a broad-based default\nevent for an entity, or the default of a\nshort-term obligation.
