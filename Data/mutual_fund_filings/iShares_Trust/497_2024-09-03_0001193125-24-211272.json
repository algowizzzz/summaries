Example.\nThis Example is intended to help\nyou compare the cost of owning\nshares of the Fund with the cost\nof investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest\n$10,000 in the Fund for the time\nperiods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses\nremain the same. Although your\nactual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these\nassumptions, your costs would be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $51        $160     $280      $628  \n                                      \nS-1\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may\npay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes\nwhen Fund shares are held in a\ntaxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. During the most\nrecent fiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate was 34%\nof the average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to\ntrack the investment results of\nthe MSCI New Zealand All Cap Top\n25 Capped Index (the \u201c Underlying\nIndex \u201d ). The Underlying Index\nis a subset of the MSCI New\nZealand All Cap Index (the \u201c\nParent Index \u201d ), which comprises\nall large-, mid-, small-, and\nmicro-capitalization stocks\nlisted in New Zealand. The\nUnderlying Index is a free float-\nadjusted market capitalization\nweighted index that includes the\n25 largest constituents in the\nParent Index and is constrained\nsuch that no single \u201c group\nentity \u201d exceeds 25% of the\nUnderlying Index weight and the\nsum of all group entities with a\nweight above 5% does not exceed\nan aggregate of 50% of the\nUnderlying Index weight, as\ndetermined by MSCI Inc. (the \u201c\nIndex Provider \u201d or \u201c MSCI \u201d ).\nThe Underlying Index also\nimplements a buffer of 10% of the\nvalue of each constraint, such\nthat the weight of any single\ngroup entity cannot exceed 22.5%\nof the Underlying Index weight\nand all group entities with a\nweight above 4.5% cannot exceed\n45% of the Underlying Index\nweight. MSCI defines a group\nentity as a group of companies\nthat operate as an affiliated\ncorporate group but may\nseparately issue listed\nsecurities. To determine whether\nconstituents are \u201c group\nentities, \u201d MSCI analyzes the\nfinancial accounts of listed\ncompanies holding stakes of 20%\nor more in other listed companies\nto determine whether these stakes\nare controlling in nature and,\nconsequently, whether both\ncompanies should be considered as\nbelonging to the same group\nentity. In certain cases, even in\nthe absence of consolidated\naccounts, MSCI may also consider\ntwo companies as belonging to the\nsame group entity where there is\nreasonable evidence of control\nbased on other information. All\ngroup entities are reviewed on an\nannual basis, though any change\nin a group entity resulting from\na corporate event ( e.g. , spin\noffs) or public disclosure will\nbe implemented at the time of the\nevent or as of the close of the\nlast business day of the month,\nrespectively. The Underlying\nIndex is rebalanced on a\nquarterly basis. As of August 7,\n2024, a significant portion of\nthe Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of\ncompanies in the healthcare,\nindustrials and real estate\nindustries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies,\nthe Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not\nseek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or\nappear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially\noutperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the\nrisks of active S-2 management,\nsuch as poor security selection.\nIndexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep\nportfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an\napplicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected\nto have, in the aggregate,\ninvestment characteristics (based\non factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not\nhold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least\n80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in\ninvestments that have economic\ncharacteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the\ncomponent securities of its\nUnderlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing\nsecurities of the Underlying\nIndex) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures,\noptions and swap contracts, cash\nand cash equivalents, including\nshares of money market funds\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates,\nas well as in securities not\nincluded in the Underlying Index,\nbut which BFA believes will help\nthe Fund track the Underlying\nIndex. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a\nderivative position will be\ntreated as part of that position\nfor the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments\nincluded in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the\nUnderlying Index before fees and\nexpenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing\nup to one-third of the value of\nthe Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any\ncollateral received). The\nUnderlying Index is sponsored by\nMSCI Inc. (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d\nor \u201c MSCI \u201d ), which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA.\nThe Index Provider determines the\ncomposition and relative\nweightings of the securities in\nthe Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding\nthe market value of the\nUnderlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments\n( i.e. , hold 25% or more of its\ntotal assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries\nto approximately the same extent\nthat the Underlying Index is\nconcentrated. For purposes of\nthis limitation, securities of\nthe U.S. government (including\nits agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase\nagreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities are not\nconsidered to be issued by\nmembers of any industry. Summary\nof Principal Risks As with any\ninvestment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the\nFund, and the Fund's performance\ncould trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject\nto certain risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share\n( \u201c NAV \u201d ), trading price,\nyield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective.\nCertain key risks are prioritized\nbelow (with others following in\nalphabetical S-3 order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk\nis difficult to predict and may\nchange over time. You should\nreview each risk factor\ncarefully. Risk of Investing in\nNew Zealand . Investments in New\nZealand issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, and economic\nrisk specific to New Zealand. The\nNew Zealand economy is heavily\ndependent on agricultural exports\nand, as a result, is susceptible\nto fluctuations in demand for\nagricultural products. New\nZealand is also dependent on\ntrade with key trading partners;\na reduction in such trade may\ncause an adverse impact on its\neconomy. Non-U.S. Securities Risk\n. Investments in the securities\nof non-U.S. issuers are subject\nto the risks associated with\ninvesting in those non-U.S.\nmarkets, such as heightened risks\nof inflation or nationalization.\nThe Fund may lose money due to\npolitical, economic and\ngeographic events affecting\nissuers of New Zealand securities\nor New Zealand markets. In\naddition, non-U.S. securities\nmarkets may trade a small number\nof securities and may be unable\nto respond effectively to changes\nin trading volume, potentially\nmaking prompt liquidation of\nholdings difficult or impossible\nat times. The Fund is\nspecifically exposed to\nAustralasian Economic Risk .\nEquity Securities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes\nin value, and their values may be\nmore volatile than those of other\nasset classes. The Underlying\nIndex is composed of common\nstocks, which generally subject\ntheir holders to more risks than\npreferred stocks and debt\nsecurities because common\nstockholders\u2019 claims are\nsubordinated to those of holders\nof preferred stocks and debt\nsecurities upon the bankruptcy of\nthe issuer. Market Risk . The\nFund could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market\nmovements and over longer periods\nduring more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts\nof terrorism, public health\nissues, recessions, the prospect\nor occurrence of a sovereign\ndefault or other financial\ncrisis, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the\nFund and its investments and\ncould result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related Risk.\nThere is no guarantee that the\nFund\u2019s investment results will\nhave a high degree of correlation\nto those of the Underlying Index\nor that the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\ndisruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an\nadverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nability to adjust its exposure to\nthe required levels in order to\ntrack the Underlying Index.\nErrors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction\nof the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology\nmay occur from time to time and\nmay not be identified and\ncorrected by the Index Provider\nfor a period of time or at all,\nwhich may have an adverse impact\non the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters,\npolitical unrest or war) may\nimpact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider, and\ncould cause the Index Provider to\npostpone a scheduled rebalance.\nThis could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or\nexpected composition. S-4 Asset\nClass Risk. Securities and other\nassets in the Underlying Index or\nin the Fund's portfolio may\nunderperform in comparison to the\ngeneral financial markets, a\nparticular financial market or\nother asset classes. Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk.\nOnly an Authorized Participant\n(as defined in the Creations and\nRedemptions section of this\nprospectus (the \u201c Prospectus \u201d ))\nmay engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund, and none of those\nAuthorized Participants is\nobligated to engage in creation\nand/or redemption transactions.\nThe Fund has a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants on an\nagency basis ( i.e., on behalf of\nother market participants). To\nthe extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or\nare unable to proceed with\ncreation or redemption orders\nwith respect to the Fund and no\nother Authorized Participant is\nable to step forward to create or\nredeem, Fund shares may be more\nlikely to trade at a premium or\ndiscount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting.\nAuthorized Participant\nconcentration risk may be\nheightened for exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ), such as the\nFund, that invest in securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers or\nother securities or instruments\nthat have lower trading volumes.\nCommodity Risk. The Fund invests\nin New Zealand issuers that are\nsusceptible to fluctuations in\ncertain commodity markets and to\nprice changes due to trade\nrelations. Any negative changes\nin commodity markets that may be\ndue to changes in supply and\ndemand for commodities, market\nevents, war, regulatory\ndevelopments, other catastrophic\nevents, or other factors that the\nFund cannot control could have an\nadverse impact on the New Zealand\neconomy. Concentration Risk. The\nFund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund's\ninvestments are concentrated in\nthe securities and/or other\nassets of a particular issuer or\nissuers, country, group of\ncountries, region, market,\nindustry, group of industries,\nsector, market segment or asset\nclass. Currency Risk . Because\nthe Fund's NAV is determined in\nU.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV\ncould decline if the currency of\na non-U.S. market in which the\nFund invests depreciates against\nthe U.S. dollar or if there are\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof such currency. Currency\nexchange rates can be very\nvolatile and can change quickly\nand unpredictably. As a result,\nthe Fund's NAV may change quickly\nand without warning.\nCybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, the Fund's\nadviser, distributor, the Index\nProvider and other service\nproviders, market makers,\nAuthorized Participants or the\nissuers of securities in which\nthe Fund invests have the ability\nto cause disruptions, negatively\nimpact the Fund\u2019s business\noperations and/or potentially\nresult in financial losses to the\nFund and its shareholders. While\nthe Fund has established business\ncontinuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to\naddress system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and\nsystems. Furthermore, the Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems of the Fund\u2019s\nIndex Provider and other S-5\nservice providers, market makers,\nAuthorized Participants or\nissuers of securities in which\nthe Fund invests. Geographic Risk\n. A natural disaster could occur\nin New Zealand, which could\nadversely affect the economy or\nthe business operations of\ncompanies located there, causing\nan adverse impact on the Fund's\ninvestments in, or which are\nexposed to, New Zealand.\nHealthcare Sector Risk . The\nprofitability of companies in the\nhealthcare sector may be affected\nby government regulations and\ngovernment healthcare programs,\nincreases or decreases in the\ncost of medical products and\nservices, an increased emphasis\non outpatient services, demand\nfor medical products and services\nand product liability claims,\namong other factors. Many\nhealthcare companies are heavily\ndependent on patent protection,\nand the expiration of a company\u2019s\npatent may adversely affect that\ncompany\u2019s profitability.\nHealthcare companies are subject\nto competitive forces that may\nresult in price discounting, and\nmay be thinly capitalized and\nsusceptible to product\nobsolescence. Indexing Investment\nRisk . The Fund is not actively\nmanaged, and BFA generally does\nnot attempt to take defensive\npositions under any market\nconditions, including declining\nmarkets. Industrials Sector Risk.\nCompanies in the industrials\nsector may be adversely affected\nby changes in the supply of and\ndemand for products and services,\nproduct obsolescence, claims for\nenvironmental damage or product\nliability and changes in general\neconomic conditions, among other\nfactors. Infectious Illness Risk.\nA widespread outbreak of an\ninfectious illness, such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, may result in\ntravel restrictions, disruption\nof healthcare services, prolonged\nquarantines, cancellations,\nsupply chain disruptions,\nbusiness closures, lower consumer\ndemand, layoffs, ratings\ndowngrades, defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and\npolitical impacts. Markets may\nexperience temporary closures,\nextreme volatility, severe\nlosses, reduced liquidity and\nincreased trading costs. Such\nevents may adversely affect the\nFund and its investments and may\nimpact the Fund\u2019s ability to\npurchase or sell securities or\ncause elevated tracking error and\nincreased premiums or discounts\nto the Fund's NAV. Despite the\ndevelopment of vaccines, the\nduration of the COVID-19 pandemic\nand its effects cannot be\npredicted with certainty. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the\nFund depends on the performance\nof individual securities to which\nthe Fund has exposure. Changes in\nthe financial condition or credit\nrating of an issuer of those\nsecurities may cause the value of\nthe securities to decline.\nManagement Risk . As the Fund\nwill not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject\nto the risk that BFA's investment\nstrategy may not produce the\nintended results. Market Trading\nRisk . The Fund faces numerous\nmarket trading risks, including\nthe potential lack of an active\nmarket for Fund shares, losses\nfrom trading in secondary\nmarkets, periods of high\nvolatility and disruptions in the\ncreation/redemption process. ANY\nOF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS,\nMAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES S-6\nTRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT\nTO NAV . Micro-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Compared to\nlarger companies, micro-\ncapitalization companies are\nlikely to be significantly less\nstable and more susceptible to\nadverse developments, and their\nrevenues and earnings tend to be\nless predictable. The securities\nof micro-capitalization companies\nare more volatile and less liquid\nthan those of larger companies.\nAs a result, the Fund\u2019s share\nprice may be more volatile than\nthat of a fund with a greater\ninvestment in larger-\ncapitalization stocks. Micro-\ncapitalization stocks also may be\nthinly traded, making it\ndifficult for the Fund to buy and\nsell them. Mid-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk . Compared to\nlarge-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may\nbe less stable and more\nsusceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. In addition, the\nsecurities of mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be more volatile\nand less liquid than those of\nlarge-capitalization companies.\nNational Closed Market Trading\nRisk. To the extent that the\nunderlying securities or other\ninstruments held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges or in\nforeign markets that may be\nclosed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s\nshares trade is open, there are\nlikely to be deviations between\nthe current price of such an\nunderlying security and the last\nquoted price for the underlying\nsecurity ( i.e ., the Fund\u2019s\nquote from the closed foreign\nmarket). The impact of a closed\nforeign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a\nlarge portion of the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying securities or other\ninstruments trade on that closed\nforeign market or when the\nforeign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV that may be greater\nthan those experienced by other\nETFs. Non-Diversification Risk .\nThe Fund is classified as \u201c non-\ndiversified. \u201d This means that,\ncompared with other funds that\nare classified as \u201c diversified,\n\u201d the Fund may invest a greater\npercentage of its assets in\nsecurities issued by or\nrepresenting a small number of\nissuers. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may depend on the\nperformance of a small number of\nissuers. Operational Risk . The\nFund is exposed to operational\nrisks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not\nlimited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or\ninadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce\nthese operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Real Estate\nInvestment Risk. Companies that\ninvest in real estate ( \u201c Real\nEstate Companies \u201d ), such as\nREITs, real estate holding and\noperating companies, and real\nestate management or development\ncompanies, expose investors in\nthe Fund to the risks of owning\nreal estate directly, as well as\nto risks that relate specifically\nto the way in which Real Estate\nCompanies are organized and\noperated. Real estate is highly\nsensitive to general and local\neconomic conditions and\ndevelopments, and characterized\nby intense competition S-7 and\nperiodic overbuilding. If the\nFund's investments in Real Estate\nCompanies are concentrated in one\ngeographic region, industry or\nproperty type, the Fund will be\nparticularly subject to the risks\nassociated with that region,\nindustry or property type. Many\nReal Estate Companies, including\nREITs, utilize leverage (and some\nmay be highly leveraged), which\nincreases investment risk and the\nrisk normally associated with\ndebt financing, and could\npotentially magnify the Fund\u2019s\nlosses. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of\ncapital for Real Estate\nCompanies, which could negatively\naffect a Real Estate Company's\nability to meet its payment\nobligations or its financing\nactivity and could decrease the\nmarket prices for REITs and for\nproperties held by such REITs.\nReliance on Trading Partners Risk\n. The Fund invests in a country\nwhose economy is heavily\ndependent upon trading with key\npartners. Any reduction in this\ntrading may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund's investments.\nThrough its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers,\nthe Fund is specifically exposed\nto Asian Economic Risk ,\nAustralasian Economic Risk and\nU.S. Economic Risk . Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may engage\nin securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that\nthe Fund may lose money because\nthe borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or\nat all. The Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline\nin the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or\na decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to mid- and large-\ncapitalization companies, small-\ncapitalization companies may be\nless stable and more susceptible\nto adverse developments. In\naddition, the securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies\nmay be more volatile and less\nliquid than those of mid- and\nlarge-capitalization companies.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund\nmay be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from\nthat of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur because\nof differences between the\nsecurities and other instruments\nheld in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in the Underlying\nIndex, pricing differences\n(including, as applicable,\ndifferences between a security\u2019s\nprice at the local market close\nand the Fund's valuation of a\nsecurity at the time of\ncalculation of the Fund's NAV),\ntransaction costs incurred by the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in\ntiming of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to the Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, the requirements to\nmaintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders, acceptance of\ncustom baskets, changes to the\nUnderlying Index or the costs to\nthe Fund of complying with\nvarious new or existing\nregulatory requirements, among\nother reasons. This risk may be\nheightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while the Underlying\nIndex does not. Tracking error\nmay occur due to differences\nbetween the S-8 methodologies\nused in calculating the value of\nthe Underlying Index and\ndetermining the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nValuation Risk . The price the\nFund could receive upon the sale\nof a security or other asset may\ndiffer from the Fund's valuation\nof the security or other asset\nand from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index, particularly\nfor securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or\nvolatile markets or that are\nvalued using a fair value\nmethodology as a result of trade\nsuspensions or for other reasons.\nIn addition, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in the\nFund's portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when\nshareholders will not be able to\npurchase or sell the Fund's\nshares. Authorized Participants\nwho purchase or redeem Fund\nshares on days when the Fund is\nholding fair-valued securities\nmay receive fewer or more shares,\nor lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities not\nbeen fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology.\nThe ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological\nissues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party\nservice providers. S-9\nPerformance Information The bar\nchart and table that follow show\nhow the Fund has performed on a\ncalendar year basis and provide\nsome indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing\nhow the Fund\u2019s average annual\nreturns for 1, 5, and 10 years\ncompare with the Underlying\nIndex.Both assume that all\ndividends and distributions have\nbeen reinvested in the Fund.

Fund\nreturns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund\nshares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient\ncapital gains of the same\ncharacter from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from\nthe sale of Fund shares. As a\nresult, Fund returns after taxes\non distributions and sales of\nFund shares may exceed Fund\nreturns before taxes and/or\nreturns after taxes on\ndistributions. 2 Index returns\nthrough February 11, 2013 reflect\nthe performance of the MSCI New\nZealand Investable Market Index.\nIndex returns beginning on\nFebruary 12, 2013 reflect the\nperformance of the MSCI New\nZealand IMI 25/50 Index, which,\neffective as of February 12,\n2013, replaced the MSCI New\nZealand Investable Market Index\nas the Underlying Index of the\nFund. 3 Effective September 3,\n2024, the Fund's Underlying Index\nchanged from the MSCI New Zealand\nIMI 25/50 Index to the MSCI New\nZealand All Cap Top 25 Capped\nIndex.\n\nS-11\n\nManagement Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer\nHsui, Greg Savage and Paul\nWhitehead (the \u201c Portfolio\nManagers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. Each\nPortfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms.\nHsui, Mr. Savage and Mr.\nWhitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012,\n2010 and 2022, respectively.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares\nThe Fund is an ETF. Individual\nshares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (a premium) or\nless than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs\nattributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase\nshares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling\nshares in the secondary market\n(the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to\nmake distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income\nor capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan\nor an IRA, in which case, your\ndistributions generally will be\ntaxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you\npurchase shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a\nbank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing\nactivities and presentations,\neducational training programs,\nconferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and\nreporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the\nbroker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson\nto recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your\nfinancial intermediary\u2019s website\nfor more information. S-12 More\nInformation About the Fund This\nProspectus contains important\ninformation about investing in\nthe Fund. Please read this\nProspectus carefully before you\nmake any investment decisions.\nAdditional information regarding\nthe Fund is available at\nwww.iShares.com. Effective\nSeptember 3, 2024, the Fund's\nUnderlying Index changed from the\nMSCI New Zealand IMI 25/50 Index\nto the MSCI New Zealand All Cap\nTop 25 Capped Index. BFA is the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund.\nShares of the Fund are listed for\ntrading on The Nasdaq Stock\nMarket LLC ( \u201c Nasdaq \u201d ). The\nmarket price for a share of the\nFund may be different from the\nFund\u2019s most recent NAV. ETFs are\nfunds that trade like other\npublicly traded securities. The\nFund is designed to track an\nindex. Similar to shares of an\nindex mutual fund, each share of\nthe Fund represents an ownership\ninterest in an underlying\nportfolio of securities and other\ninstruments intended to track a\nmarket index. Unlike shares of a\nmutual fund, which can be bought\nand redeemed from the issuing\nfund by all shareholders at a\nprice based on NAV, shares of the\nFund may be purchased or redeemed\ndirectly from the Fund at NAV\nsolely by Authorized Participants\nand only in aggregations of a\nspecified number of shares ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Also unlike\nshares of a mutual fund, shares\nof the Fund are listed on a\nnational securities exchange and\ntrade in the secondary market at\nmarket prices that change\nthroughout the day. The Fund\ninvests in a particular segment\nof the securities markets and\nseeks to track the performance of\na securities index that is not\nrepresentative of the market as a\nwhole. The Fund is designed to be\nused as part of broader asset\nallocation strategies.\nAccordingly, an investment in the\nFund should not constitute a\ncomplete investment program. An\nindex is a financial calculation,\nbased on a grouping of financial\ninstruments, and is not an\ninvestment product, while the\nFund is an actual investment\nportfolio. The performance of the\nFund and the Underlying Index may\nvary for a number of reasons,\nincluding transaction costs,\nnon-U.S. currency valuations,\nasset valuations, corporate\nactions (such as mergers and\nspin-offs), timing variances and\ndifferences between the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and the Underlying\nIndex resulting from the Fund's\nuse of representative sampling or\nfrom legal restrictions (such as\ndiversification requirements)\nthat apply to the Fund but not to\nthe Underlying Index. From time\nto time, the Index Provider may\nmake changes to the methodology\nor other adjustments to the\nUnderlying Index. Unless\notherwise determined by BFA, any\nsuch change or adjustment will be\nreflected in the calculation of\nthe Underlying Index performance\non a going-forward basis after\nthe effective date of such change\nor adjustment. Therefore, the\nUnderlying Index performance\nshown for periods prior to the\neffective date of any such change\nor adjustment will generally not\nbe recalculated or restated to\nreflect such change or\nadjustment. Because the Fund uses\na representative sampling\nindexing strategy, it can be\nexpected to have a larger\ntracking error than if it used a\nreplication indexing strategy. 1\n\u201c Replication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests\nin substantially all of the\nsecurities in its underlying\nindex in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying\nindex. The Fund may borrow as a\ntemporary measure for\nextraordinary or emergency\npurposes, including to meet\nredemptions or to facilitate the\nsettlement of securities or other\ntransactions. The Fund does not\nintend to borrow money in order\nto leverage its portfolio. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not a\nbank deposit and it is not\ninsured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other\ngovernment agency, BFA or any of\nits affiliates. The Fund's\ninvestment objective and the\nUnderlying Index may be changed\nwithout shareholder approval. A\nFurther Discussion of Principal\nRisks The Fund is subject to\nvarious risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s NAV, trading price, yield,\ntotal return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. You\ncould lose all or part of your\ninvestment in the Fund, and the\nFund could underperform other\ninvestments. The order of the\nbelow risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. The Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com. Asian\nEconomic Risk. Certain Asian\neconomies have experienced rapid\ngrowth and industrialization in\nrecent years, but there is no\nassurance that this growth rate\nwill be maintained. Other Asian\neconomies, however, have\nexperienced high inflation, high\nunemployment, currency\ndevaluations and restrictions,\nand over-extension of credit.\nGeopolitical hostility, political\ninstability, and economic or\nenvironmental events in any one\nAsian country may have a\nsignificant economic effect on\nthe entire Asian region, as well\nas on major trading partners\noutside Asia. Any adverse event\nin the Asian markets may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on\nsome or all of the economies of\nthe countries in which the Fund\ninvests. In particular, China is\na key trading partner of many\nAsian countries and any changes\nin trading relationships between\nChina and other Asian countries\nmay affect the region as a whole.\nMany Asian countries are subject\nto political risk, including\npolitical instability, corruption\nand regional conflict with\nneighboring countries. North\nKorea and South Korea each have\nsubstantial military\ncapabilities, and historical\ntensions between the two\ncountries present the risk of\nwar. Escalated tensions involving\nthe two countries and any\noutbreak of hostilities between\nthe two countries, or even the\nthreat of an outbreak of\nhostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire\nAsian region. Certain Asian\ncountries have developed\nincreasingly strained\nrelationships with the U.S. or\nwith China, and if these\nrelations were to worsen, they\ncould adversely affect Asian\nissuers that rely on the U.S. or\nChina for trade. In addition,\nmany Asian countries are subject\nto social and labor risks\nassociated with demands for\nimproved political, economic and\nsocial conditions. These risks,\namong others, may adversely\naffect the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets\nin the Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to other securities\nor indexes that 2 track other\ncountries, groups of countries,\nregions, industries, groups of\nindustries, markets, market\nsegments, asset classes or\nsectors. Various types of\nsecurities, currencies and\nindexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and\nunderperformance in comparison to\nthe general financial markets\ndepending upon a number of\nfactors including, among other\nthings, inflation, interest\nrates, productivity, global\ndemand for local products or\nresources, and regulation and\ngovernmental controls. This may\ncause the Fund to underperform\nother investment vehicles that\ninvest in different asset\nclasses. Australasian Economic\nRisk. The economies of\nAustralasia, which include\nAustralia and New Zealand, are\ndependent on exports from the\nenergy, agricultural and mining\nsectors. This makes Australasian\neconomies susceptible to\nfluctuations in the commodity\nmarkets. Australasian economies\nare also increasingly dependent\non their growing service\nindustries. Because the economies\nof Australasia are dependent on\nthe economies of their key\ntrading partners, which include\nthe U.S., China, Japan, South\nKorea, as well as other Asian\ncountries and certain European\ncountries, reduction in spending\nby any of these trading partners\non Australasian products and\nservices, or negative changes in\nany of these economies, may cause\nan adverse impact on some or all\nof the Australasian economies.\nEconomic events in key trading\ncountries can have a significant\neconomic effect on the\nAustralasian economies.\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund, and none of those\nAuthorized Participants is\nobligated to engage in creation\nand/or redemption transactions.\nThe Fund has a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants on an\nagency basis ( i.e. , on behalf\nof other market participants). To\nthe extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or\nare unable to proceed with\ncreation or redemption orders\nwith respect to the Fund and no\nother Authorized Participant is\nable to step forward to create or\nredeem Creation Units, Fund\nshares may be more likely to\ntrade at a premium or discount to\nNAV and possibly face trading\nhalts or delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk\nmay be heightened because ETFs,\nsuch as the Fund, that invest in\nsecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers or other securities or\ninstruments that are less widely\ntraded often involve greater\nsettlement and operational issues\nand capital costs for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the\navailability of Authorized\nParticipants. Commodity Risk. The\nagricultural and mining sectors\nof New Zealand's economy account\nfor the majority of its exports.\nNew Zealand is susceptible to\nfluctuations in the commodity\nmarkets and, in particular, in\nthe price and demand for\nagricultural products and natural\nresources. Any negative changes\nin these sectors could have an\nadverse impact on the New Zealand\neconomy. Concentration Risk. The\nFund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund's\ninvestments are concentrated in\nthe securities and/or other\nassets of a particular issuer or\nissuers, country, group of\ncountries, region, market,\nindustry, group of industries,\nproject types, group of project\ntypes, sector, market segment or\nasset class. The Fund may be more\nadversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those\nsecurities and/or other assets,\nmay 3 experience increased price\nvolatility and may be more\nsusceptible to adverse economic,\nmarket, political or regulatory\noccurrences affecting those\nsecurities and/or other assets\nthan a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments.\nCurrency Risk. Because the Fund's\nNAV is determined on the basis of\nthe U.S. dollar, investors may\nlose money if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the\nU.S. dollar or if there are\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof such currency, even if such\ncurrency value of the Fund's\nholdings in that market\nincreases. Currency exchange\nrates can be very volatile and\ncan change quickly and\nunpredictably. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and\nwithout warning. Cybersecurity\nRisk. The Fund, Authorized\nParticipants, service providers\nand the relevant listing exchange\nare susceptible to operational,\ninformation security and related\n\u201c cyber \u201d risks both directly and\nthrough their service providers.\nSimilar types of cybersecurity\nrisks are also present for\nissuers of securities in which\nthe Fund invests, which could\nresult in material adverse\nconsequences for such issuers and\nmay cause the Fund\u2019s investment\nin such issuers to lose value. In\ngeneral, cyber incidents can\nresult from deliberate attacks or\nunintentional events. Cyber\nincidents include, but are not\nlimited to, gaining unauthorized\naccess to digital systems ( e.g.\n, through \u201c hacking \u201d or\nmalicious software coding) for\npurposes of misappropriating\nassets or sensitive information,\ncorrupting data, or causing\noperational disruption.\nCyberattacks may also be carried\nout in a manner that does not\nrequire gaining unauthorized\naccess, such as causing denial-\nof-service attacks on websites (\ni.e. , efforts to make network\nservices unavailable to intended\nusers). Geopolitical tensions may\nincrease the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate\nattacks, particularly those from\nnation-states or from entities\nwith nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity failures by, or\nbreaches of, the systems of the\nFund's adviser, distributor and\nother service providers\n(including, but not limited to,\nindex and benchmark providers,\nfund accountants, custodians,\ntransfer agents and\nadministrators), market makers,\nAuthorized Participants or the\nissuers of securities in which\nthe Fund invests have the ability\nto cause disruptions and impact\nbusiness operations, potentially\nresulting in: financial losses,\ninterference with the Fund\u2019s\nability to calculate its NAV,\ndisclosure of confidential\ntrading information, impediments\nto trading, submission of\nerroneous trades or erroneous\ncreation or redemption orders,\nthe inability of the Fund or its\nservice providers to transact\nbusiness, violations of\napplicable privacy and other\nlaws, regulatory fines,\npenalties, reputational damage,\nreimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, or additional\ncompliance costs. In addition,\ncyberattacks may render records\nof Fund assets and transactions,\nshareholder ownership of Fund\nshares, and other data integral\nto the functioning of the Fund\ninaccessible, inaccurate or\nincomplete. Substantial costs may\nbe incurred by the Fund in order\nto resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent,\nsuch cyber incidents, there are\ninherent limitations in such\nplans and systems, including the\npossibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that\nprevention and remediation\nefforts will not be successful or\nthat cyberattacks will go\nundetected. Furthermore, the Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems put in place by\nservice providers to the 4 Fund,\nissuers in which the Fund\ninvests, the Index Provider,\nmarket makers or Authorized\nParticipants. The Fund and its\nshareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Equity\nSecurities Risk. The Fund invests\nin equity securities, which are\nsubject to changes in value that\nmay be attributable to market\nperception of a particular issuer\nor to general stock market\nfluctuations that affect all\nissuers. Investments in equity\nsecurities may be more volatile\nthan investments in other asset\nclasses. The Underlying Index is\ncomposed of common stocks, which\ngenerally subject their holders\nto more risks than preferred\nstocks and debt securities\nbecause common stockholders'\nclaims are subordinated to those\nof holders of preferred stocks\nand debt securities upon the\nbankruptcy of the issuer.\nGeographic Risk. New Zealand is\nlocated in a part of the world\nthat has historically been prone\nto natural disasters such as\nearthquakes, and is economically\nsensitive to environmental\nevents. Any such event may\nadversely impact New Zealand's\neconomy or business operations of\ncompanies in New Zealand, causing\nan adverse impact on the value of\nthe Fund. Healthcare Sector Risk.\nThe profitability of companies in\nthe healthcare sector may be\nadversely affected by the\nfollowing factors, among others:\nextensive government regulations,\nrestrictions on government\nreimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing\npressure, an increased emphasis\non outpatient services, changes\nin the demand for medical\nproducts and services, a limited\nnumber of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in\ntechnologies and other market\ndevelopments. Many healthcare\ncompanies are heavily dependent\non patent protection. The\nexpiration of a company\u2019s patents\nmay adversely affect that\ncompany\u2019s profitability. Many\nhealthcare companies are subject\nto extensive litigation based on\nproduct liability and similar\nclaims. Healthcare companies are\nsubject to competitive forces\nthat may make it difficult to\nraise prices and, in fact, may\nresult in price discounting. The\nU.S. Inflation Reduction Act of\n2022 allows for the negotiation\nof prescription drug prices on\nbehalf of Medicare recipients,\nwhich may result in reduced\nprescription prices. This could\nreduce some healthcare companies\u2019\noverall profitability. Many new\nproducts in the healthcare sector\nmay be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of\nobtaining such approvals may be\nlong and costly, and such efforts\nultimately may be unsuccessful.\nCompanies in the healthcare\nsector may be thinly capitalized\nand may be susceptible to product\nobsolescence. Indexing Investment\nRisk. The Fund is not actively\nmanaged and may be affected by a\ngeneral decline in market\nsegments related to the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund\ninvests in securities included\nin, or representative of, the\nUnderlying Index, regardless of\ntheir investment merits. BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to\ninvest the Fund's assets in\ndefensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including\ndeclining markets. Index-Related\nRisk. The Fund seeks to achieve a\nreturn that corresponds generally\nto the price and yield\nperformance, before fees and\nexpenses, of the Underlying Index\nas published by the Index\nProvider. There is no assurance\nthat the Index Provider or any\nagents that may act on its behalf\nwill compile the Underlying Index\naccurately, or that the\nUnderlying Index will be\ndetermined, composed or\ncalculated accurately. While the\nIndex Provider provides\ndescriptions of what the\nUnderlying Index is designed to 5\nachieve, neither the Index\nProvider nor its agents provide\nany warranty or accept any\nliability in relation to the\nquality, accuracy or completeness\nof the Underlying Index or its\nrelated data, and they do not\nguarantee that the Underlying\nIndex will be in line with the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology.\nBFA\u2019s mandate as described in\nthis Prospectus is to manage the\nFund consistently with the\nUnderlying Index provided by the\nIndex Provider to BFA. BFA does\nnot provide any warranty or\nguarantee against the Index\nProvider\u2019s or any agent\u2019s errors.\nErrors in respect of the quality,\naccuracy and completeness of the\ndata used to compile the\nUnderlying Index may occur from\ntime to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of\ntime or at all, particularly\nwhere the indices are less\ncommonly used as benchmarks by\nfunds or managers. Such errors\nmay negatively or positively\nimpact the Fund and its\nshareholders. For example, during\na period where the Underlying\nIndex contains incorrect\nconstituents, the Fund would have\nmarket exposure to such\nconstituents and would be\nunderexposed to the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s other constituents.\nShareholders should understand\nthat any gains from Index\nProvider errors will be kept by\nthe Fund and its shareholders and\nany losses or costs resulting\nfrom Index Provider errors will\nbe borne by the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural\ndisasters, political unrest or\nwar) may impact the Index\nProvider or a third-party data\nprovider, and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to the\nUnderlying Index. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. The postponement of\na scheduled rebalance could mean\nthat constituents of the\nUnderlying Index that would\notherwise be removed at rebalance\ndue to changes in market\ncapitalizations, issuer credit\nratings, or other reasons may\nremain, causing the performance\nand constituents of the\nUnderlying Index to vary from\nthose expected under normal\nconditions. Apart from scheduled\nrebalances, the Index Provider or\nits agents may carry out\nadditional ad hoc rebalances to\nthe Underlying Index due to\nreaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market\nconditions or corporate events\nor, for example, to correct an\nerror in the selection of index\nconstituents. When the Underlying\nIndex is rebalanced and the Fund\nin turn rebalances its portfolio\nto attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and the Underlying\nIndex, any transaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising from such\nportfolio rebalancing will be\nborne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. Therefore,\nerrors and additional ad hoc\nrebalances carried out by the\nIndex Provider or its agents to\nthe Underlying Index may increase\nthe costs to and the tracking\nerror risk of the Fund.\nIndustrials Sector Risk. The\nvalue of securities issued by\ncompanies in the industrials\nsector may be adversely affected\nby supply and demand changes\nrelated to their specific\nproducts or services and\nindustrials sector products in\ngeneral. The products of\nmanufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid\ntechnological developments and\nfrequent new product\nintroduction. Global events,\ntrade disputes and changes in\ngovernment regulations, economic\nconditions and exchange rates may\nadversely affect the performance\nof companies in the industrials\nsector. Companies in the\nindustrials sector may be\nadversely affected by liability\nfor environmental damage and\nproduct liability claims. The\nindustrials sector may also be\nadversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which\nmay be influenced by\nunpredictable 6 factors.\nCompanies in the industrials\nsector, particularly aerospace\nand defense companies, may also\nbe adversely affected by\ngovernment spending policies\nbecause companies in this sector\ntend to rely to a significant\nextent on government demand for\ntheir products and services.\nInfectious Illness Risk. A\nwidespread outbreak of an\ninfectious illness, such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, may adversely\naffect the economies of many\nnations and the global economy\nand may impact individual issuers\nand capital markets in ways that\ncannot be foreseen. An infectious\nillness outbreak may result in\ntravel restrictions, closed\ninternational borders, disruption\nof healthcare services, prolonged\nquarantines, cancellations,\nsupply chain disruptions, lower\nconsumer demand, temporary and\npermanent closures of businesses,\nlayoffs, defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and\npolitical impacts, as well as\ngeneral concern and uncertainty.\nAn infectious illness outbreak\nmay result in extreme volatility,\nsevere losses, credit\ndeterioration of issuers, and\ndisruptions in markets, which\ncould adversely impact the Fund\nand its investments, including\nimpairing any hedging activity.\nCertain local markets may be\nsubject to closures. Any\nsuspension of trading in markets\nin which the Fund invests will\nhave an impact on the Fund and\nits investments and will impact\nthe Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or\nsell securities in such markets.\nMarket or economic disruptions\ncould result in elevated tracking\nerror and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund's NAV.\nAdditionally, an outbreak could\nimpair the operations of the\nFund\u2019s service providers,\nincluding BFA, which could\nadversely impact the Fund.\nGovernmental and quasi-\ngovernmental authorities and\nregulators throughout the world\nmay respond to an outbreak and\nany resulting economic\ndisruptions with a variety of\nfiscal and monetary policy\nchanges, including direct capital\ninfusions into companies and\nother issuers, new monetary\npolicy tools, and changes in\ninterest rates. A reversal of\nthese policies, or the\nineffectiveness of such policies,\nis likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments. An\noutbreak may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social\nand economic risks in certain\ncountries or globally, which\ncould adversely affect the Fund\nand its investments and could\nresult in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund's NAV.\nDespite the development of\nvaccines, the duration of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and its effects\ncannot be predicted with\ncertainty. Issuer Risk. The\nperformance of the Fund depends\non the performance of individual\nsecurities to which the Fund has\nexposure. Any issuer of these\nsecurities may perform poorly,\ncausing the value of its\nsecurities to decline. Poor\nperformance may be caused by poor\nmanagement decisions, competitive\npressures, changes in technology,\nexpiration of patent protection,\ndisruptions in supply, labor\nproblems or shortages, corporate\nrestructurings, fraudulent\ndisclosures, credit deterioration\nof the issuer or other factors.\nIssuers may, in times of distress\nor at their own discretion,\ndecide to reduce or eliminate\ndividends, which may also cause\ntheir stock prices to decline. An\nissuer may also be subject to\nrisks associated with the\ncountries, states and regions in\nwhich the issuer resides,\ninvests, sells products, or\notherwise conducts operations. 7\nManagement Risk. Because BFA uses\na representative sampling\nindexing strategy, the Fund will\nnot fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold\nsecurities not included in the\nUnderlying Index. As a result,\nthe Fund is subject to the risk\nthat BFA\u2019s investment strategy,\nthe implementation of which is\nsubject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the\nintended results. Market Risk.\nThe Fund could lose money over\nshort periods due to short-term\nmarket movements and over longer\nperiods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. The value of a\nfinancial instrument or other\nasset may decline due to changes\nin general market conditions,\neconomic trends or events that\nare not specifically related to\nthe particular instrument or\nasset, or factors that affect one\nor more issuers, counterparties,\nexchanges, countries, regions,\nmarkets, industries, sectors or\nasset classes, as applicable.\nLocal, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism,\npublic health issues, recessions,\nthe prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact\non the Fund and its investments\nand could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Changes in market and\neconomic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all\ntypes of instruments and assets.\nMarket Trading Risk. Absence of\nActive Market. Although shares of\nthe Fund are listed for trading\non one or more stock exchanges,\nthere can be no assurance that an\nactive trading market for such\nshares will develop or be\nmaintained by market makers or\nAuthorized Participants. Risk of\nSecondary Listings. The Fund's\nshares may be listed or traded on\nU.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges\nother than the U.S. stock\nexchange where the Fund's primary\nlisting is maintained, and may\notherwise be made available to\nnon-U.S. investors through funds\nor structured investment vehicles\nsimilar to depositary receipts.\nThere can be no assurance that\nthe Fund\u2019s shares will continue\nto trade on any such stock\nexchange or in any market or that\nthe Fund\u2019s shares will continue\nto meet the requirements for\nlisting or trading on any\nexchange or in any market. The\nFund's shares may be less\nactively traded in certain\nmarkets than in others, and\ninvestors are subject to the\nexecution and settlement risks\nand market standards of the\nmarket where they or their broker\ndirect their trades for\nexecution. Certain information\navailable to investors who trade\nFund shares on a U.S. stock\nexchange during regular U.S.\nmarket hours may not be available\nto investors who trade in other\nmarkets, which may result in\nsecondary market prices in such\nmarkets being less efficient.\nSecondary Market Trading Risk.\nShares of the Fund may trade in\nthe secondary market at times\nwhen the Fund does not accept\norders to purchase or redeem\nshares. At such times, shares may\ntrade in the secondary market\nwith more significant premiums or\ndiscounts than might be\nexperienced at times when the\nFund accepts purchase and\nredemption orders. Secondary\nmarket trading in Fund shares may\nbe halted by a stock exchange\nbecause of market conditions or\nfor other reasons. In addition,\ntrading in Fund shares on a stock\nexchange or in any market may be\nsubject to trading halts caused\nby 8 extraordinary market\nvolatility pursuant to \u201c circuit\nbreaker \u201d rules on the stock\nexchange or market. Shares of the\nFund, similar to shares of other\nissuers listed on a stock\nexchange, may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk\nof increased volatility and price\ndecreases associated with being\nsold short. In addition, trading\nactivity in derivative products\nbased on the Fund may lead to\nincreased trading volume and\nvolatility in the secondary\nmarket for the shares of the\nFund. Shares of the Fund May\nTrade at Prices Other Than NAV.\nShares of the Fund trade on stock\nexchanges at prices at, above or\nbelow the Fund\u2019s most recent NAV.\nThe NAV of the Fund is calculated\nat the end of each business day\nand fluctuates with changes in\nthe market value of the Fund\u2019s\nholdings. The trading price of\nthe Fund's shares fluctuates\ncontinuously throughout trading\nhours based on both market supply\nof and demand for Fund shares and\nthe underlying value of the\nFund's portfolio holdings or NAV.\nAs a result, the trading prices\nof the Fund\u2019s shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during\nperiods of market volatility. ANY\nOF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS,\nMAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES\nTRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT\nTO NAV . However, because shares\ncan be created and redeemed in\nCreation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or\npremiums to the NAV of the Fund\nare not likely to be sustained\nover the long term (unlike shares\nof many closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While\nthe creation/redemption feature\nis designed to make it more\nlikely that the Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock\nexchanges at prices close to the\nFund\u2019s next calculated NAV,\nexchange prices are not expected\nto correlate exactly with the\nFund's NAV due to timing reasons,\nsupply and demand imbalances and\nother factors. In addition,\ndisruptions to creations and\nredemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, or other\nmarket participants, and during\nperiods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading\nprices for shares of the Fund\nthat differ significantly from\nits NAV. Authorized Participants\nmay be less willing to create or\nredeem Fund shares if there is a\nlack of an active market for such\nshares or its underlying\ninvestments, which may contribute\nto the Fund\u2019s shares trading at a\npremium or discount to NAV. Costs\nof Buying or Selling Fund Shares.\nBuying or selling Fund shares on\nan exchange involves two types of\ncosts that apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling shares of the\nFund through a broker, you will\nlikely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In\naddition, you may incur the cost\nof the \u201c spread \u201d ; that is, the\ndifference between what investors\nare willing to pay for Fund\nshares (the \u201c bid \u201d price) and\nthe price at which they are\nwilling to sell Fund shares (the\n\u201c ask \u201d price). The spread, which\nvaries over time for shares of\nthe Fund based on trading volume\nand market liquidity, is\ngenerally narrower if the Fund\nhas more trading volume and\nmarket liquidity and wider if the\nFund has less trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. In addition,\nincreased market volatility may\ncause wider spreads. There may\nalso be regulatory and other\ncharges that are incurred as a\nresult of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in\nbuying or selling Fund shares,\nfrequent trading may detract\nsignificantly from investment\nresults and an investment in Fund\nshares may not be 9 advisable for\ninvestors who anticipate\nregularly making small\ninvestments through a brokerage\naccount. Micro-Capitalization\nCompanies Risk. Investments in\nmicro-capitalization companies\nare likely to be significantly\nriskier, less liquid, more\nvolatile and more susceptible to\neconomic, market and industry\nchanges than investments in\nlarger companies. Micro-\ncapitalization companies are\nsubject to substantially greater\nrisk of loss and price\nfluctuations because their\nearnings and revenues tend to be\nless predictable, and some\ncompanies may experience\nsignificant losses. These\ncompanies may be in the early\nstages of development, with\nrelatively little information\navailable to investors, and are\nlikely to have limited product\nlines, markets, financial\nresources, personnel and\nmanagement experience. As a\nresult, they are more vulnerable\nthan larger companies to adverse\nbusiness and economic\ndevelopments. Micro-\ncapitalization securities tend to\ntrade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than the\nsecurities of larger companies.\nMicro-capitalization securities\nmay be illiquid or restricted as\nto resale, and their values may\nhave significant volatility. A\nFund may be unable to liquidate\nits positions in such securities\nat any time, or at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet the\nFund\u2019s obligations. Mid-\nCapitalization Companies Risk.\nStock prices of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be\nmore volatile than those of\nlarge-capitalization companies\nand, therefore, the Fund\u2019s share\nprice may be more volatile than\nthose of funds that invest a\nlarger percentage of their assets\nin stocks issued by large-\ncapitalization companies. Stock\nprices of mid-capitalization\ncompanies are also more\nvulnerable than those of large-\ncapitalization companies to\nadverse business or economic\ndevelopments, and the stocks of\nmid-capitalization companies may\nbe less liquid than those of\nlarge-capitalization companies,\nmaking it difficult for the Fund\nto buy and sell shares of mid-\ncapitalization companies. In\naddition, mid-capitalization\ncompanies generally have less\ndiverse product lines than large-\ncapitalization companies and are\nmore susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments related to their\nproducts. National Closed Market\nTrading Risk. To the extent that\nthe underlying securities or\nother instruments held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges\nor in foreign markets that may be\nclosed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s\nshares trade is open, there are\nlikely to be deviations between\nthe current price of an\nunderlying security and the last\nquoted price for the underlying\nsecurity ( i.e. , the Fund\u2019s\nquote from the closed foreign\nmarket). The impact of a closed\nforeign market on the Fund is\nlikely to be greater where a\nlarge portion of the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying securities or other\ninstruments trade on that closed\nforeign market or when the\nforeign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV that may be greater\nthan those experienced by other\nETFs. Non-Diversification Risk.\nThe Fund is classified as \u201c non-\ndiversified. \u201d This means that,\ncompared with other funds that\nare classified as \u201c diversified,\n\u201d the Fund may invest a greater\npercentage of its assets in\nsecurities issued by or\nrepresenting a small number of\nissuers. As a result, the Fund\nmay be more susceptible to the\nrisks associated with these\nparticular issuers or to a single\neconomic, political or regulatory\noccurrence affecting these\nissuers. 10 Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk. Investments in the\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers\nare subject to the risks of\ninvesting in the markets where\nsuch issuers are located,\nincluding heightened risks of\ninflation, nationalization and\nmarket fluctuations caused by\neconomic and political\ndevelopments. As a result of\ninvesting in non-U.S. securities,\nthe Fund may be subject to\nincreased risk of loss caused by\nany of the factors listed below:\n\u25a0 Government intervention in\nissuers' operations or structure;\n\u25a0 A lack of market liquidity and\nmarket efficiency; \u25a0 Greater\nsecurities price volatility; \u25a0\nExchange rate fluctuations and\nexchange controls; \u25a0 Less\navailability of public\ninformation about issuers; \u25a0\nLimitations on foreign ownership\nof securities; \u25a0 Imposition of\nwithholding or other taxes; \u25a0\nImposition of restrictions on the\nexpatriation of the funds or\nother assets of the Fund; \u25a0\nHigher transaction and custody\ncosts and delays in settlement\nprocedures; \u25a0 Difficulties in\nenforcing contractual\nobligations; \u25a0 Lower levels of\nregulation of the securities\nmarkets; \u25a0 Weaker accounting,\ndisclosure and reporting\nrequirements and the risk of\nbeing delisted from U.S.\nexchanges; and \u25a0 Legal principles\nrelating to corporate governance,\ndirectors\u2019 fiduciary duties and\nliabilities and stockholders\u2019\nrights in markets in which the\nFund invests may differ from or\nmay not be as extensive or\nprotective as those that apply in\nthe U.S. Withholding Tax Reclaims\nRisk . The Fund may file claims\nto recover withholding tax on\ndividend and interest income (if\nany) received from issuers in\ncertain countries where such\nwithholding tax reclaim is\npossible. Whether or when the\nFund will receive a withholding\ntax refund in the future is\nwithin the control of the tax\nauthorities in such countries.\nWhere the Fund expects to recover\nwithholding tax based on a\ncontinuous assessment of\nprobability of recovery, the NAV\nof the Fund generally includes\naccruals for such tax refunds.\nThe Fund continues to evaluate\ntax developments for potential\nimpact to the probability of\nrecovery. If the likelihood of\nreceiving refunds materially\ndecreases, for example due to a\nchange in tax regulation or\napproach, accruals in the Fund\u2019s\nNAV for such refunds may need to\nbe written down partially or in\nfull, which will adversely affect\nthat Fund\u2019s NAV. Investors in the\nFund at the time an accrual is\nwritten down will bear the impact\nof any resulting reduction in NAV\nregardless of whether they were\ninvestors during the accrual\nperiod. Conversely, if a Fund\nreceives a tax refund that has\nnot been previously accrued,\ninvestors in the Fund at the time\nthe claim is successful will\nbenefit from any resulting\nincrease in the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nInvestors who sold their shares\nprior to such time will not\nbenefit from such NAV increase.\nOperational Risk. The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to,\nhuman error, processing and\ncommunication errors, errors of\nthe Fund's service providers,\ncounterparties or other third\nparties, 11 failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Real Estate\nInvestment Risk. Companies that\ninvest in real estate ( \u201c Real\nEstate Companies \u201d ), such as\nreal estate investment trusts ( \u201c\nREITs \u201d ), real estate holding\nand operating companies, and real\nestate management or development\ncompanies, expose investors to\nthe risks of owning real estate\ndirectly, as well as to risks\nthat relate specifically to the\nway in which Real Estate\nCompanies are organized and\noperated. Real estate is highly\nsensitive to general and local\neconomic conditions and\ndevelopments and is characterized\nby intense competition and\nperiodic overbuilding. Many Real\nEstate Companies, including\nREITs, utilize leverage (and some\nmay be highly leveraged), which\nincreases investment risk and the\nrisk normally associated with\ndebt financing, and could\npotentially increase the Fund\u2019s\nlosses. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of\ncapital for Real Estate\nCompanies, which could negatively\naffect a Real Estate Company's\nability to meet its payment\nobligations or its financing\nactivity and could decrease the\nmarket prices for REITs and for\nproperties held by such REITs. In\naddition, to the extent a Real\nEstate Company has its own\nexpenses, the Fund (and\nindirectly, its shareholders)\nwill bear its proportionate share\nof such expenses. Concentration\nRisk . Real Estate Companies may\nown a limited number of\nproperties and concentrate their\ninvestments in a particular\ngeographic region, industry or\nproperty type. Economic downturns\naffecting a particular region,\nindustry or property type may\nlead to a high volume of defaults\nwithin a short period. Equity\nREITs Risk. Certain REITs may\nmake direct investments in real\nestate. These REITs are often\nreferred to as \u201c Equity REITs. \u201d\nEquity REITs invest primarily in\nreal properties and may earn\nrental income from leasing those\nproperties. Equity REITs may also\nrealize gains or losses from the\nsale of properties. Equity REITs\nwill be affected by conditions in\nthe real estate rental market and\nby changes in the value of the\nproperties they own. A decline in\nrental income may occur because\nof extended vacancies,\nlimitations on rents, the failure\nto collect rents, increased\ncompetition from other properties\nor poor management. Equity REITs\nalso can be affected by rising\ninterest rates. Rising interest\nrates may cause investors to\ndemand a high annual yield from\nfuture distributions that, in\nturn, could decrease the market\nprices for such REITs and for the\nproperties held by such REITs. In\naddition, rising interest rates\nalso increase the costs of\nobtaining financing for real\nestate projects. Because many\nreal estate projects are\ndependent upon receiving\nfinancing, this could cause the\nvalue of the Equity REITs in\nwhich the Fund invests to\ndecline. Illiquidity Risk .\nInvesting in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks\nsimilar to those associated with\ninvesting in small-capitalization\ncompanies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities may be volatile. There\nmay be less trading in Real\nEstate Company shares, which\nmeans that purchase and sale\ntransactions in those shares\ncould have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt\nor erratic price fluctuations. In\naddition, real estate is\nrelatively illiquid and,\ntherefore, a Real Estate Company\nmay have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate its investments\nin properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other\nconditions. 12 Interest Rate Risk\n. Rising interest rates could\nresult in higher costs of capital\nfor Real Estate Companies, which\ncould negatively affect a Real\nEstate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations.\nDeclining interest rates could\nresult in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of\ncapital in less desirable\ninvestments. Leverage Risk . Real\nEstate Companies may use leverage\n(and some may be highly\nleveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and the risks\nnormally associated with debt\nfinancing and could adversely\naffect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\noperations and market value in\nperiods of rising interest rates.\nFinancial covenants related to a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s leveraging\nmay affect the ability of the\nReal Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition,\ninvestments may be subject to\ndefaults by borrowers and\ntenants. Leveraging may also\nincrease repayment risk. Loan\nForeclosure Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may foreclose on loans\nthat the Real Estate Company\noriginated and/or acquired.\nForeclosure may generate negative\npublicity for the underlying\nproperty that affects its market\nvalue. In addition to the length\nand expense of such proceedings,\nthe validity of the terms of the\napplicable loan may not be\nrecognized in foreclosure\nproceedings. Operational Risk .\nReal Estate Companies are\ndependent upon management skills\nand may have limited financial\nresources. Real Estate Companies\nare generally not diversified and\nmay be subject to heavy cash flow\ndependency, default by borrowers\nand self-liquidation. In\naddition, transactions between\nReal Estate Companies and their\naffiliates may be subject to\nconflicts of interest, which may\nadversely affect a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s shareholders. A Real\nEstate Company may also have\njoint ventures in certain of its\nproperties and, consequently, its\nability to control decisions\nrelating to such properties may\nbe limited. Property Risk . Real\nEstate Companies may be subject\nto risks relating to functional\nobsolescence or reduced\ndesirability of properties;\nextended vacancies due to\neconomic conditions and tenant\nbankruptcies; property damage due\nto events such as earthquakes,\nhurricanes, tornadoes, rodent,\ninsect or disease infestations\nand terrorist acts; eminent\ndomain seizures; and casualty or\ncondemnation losses. Real estate\nincome and values also may be\ngreatly affected by demographic\ntrends, such as population\nshifts, changes in consumer\npreferences and values,\nincreasing vacancies or declining\nrents resulting from legal,\ncultural, technological, global\nor local economic developments\nand changes in tax law.\nRegulatory Risk . Real estate\nincome and values may be\nadversely affected by applicable\ndomestic and foreign laws\n(including tax laws). Government\nactions, such as tax increases,\nzoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other commercial\nrestrictions, reduced funding for\nschools, parks, garbage\ncollection and other public\nservices or environmental\nregulations also may have a major\nimpact on real estate income and\nvalues. Repayment Risk. The\nprices of Real Estate Company\nsecurities may drop because of\nthe failure of borrowers to repay\ntheir loans, poor management, or\nthe inability to obtain financing\neither on favorable terms or at\nall. If the properties in which\nReal Estate Companies invest do\nnot generate sufficient income to\nmeet operating 13 expenses,\nincluding, where applicable, debt\nservice, ground lease payments,\ntenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other\ncapital expenditures, the income\nand ability of the Real Estate\nCompanies to make payments of\ninterest and principal on their\nloans will be adversely affected.\nReliance on Trading Partners\nRisk. New Zealand's economy is\ndependent on the economies of\nAsia, Australia and the U.S. A\nreduction in spending by any of\nthese economies on New Zealand\nproducts and services or negative\nchanges in any of these economies\nmay cause an adverse impact on\nNew Zealand's economy and the\nFund's investments. Risk of\nInvesting in New Zealand.\nInvestments in New Zealand\nissuers will subject the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, and economic risk\nspecific to New Zealand. The New\nZealand economy is heavily\ndependent on exports from the\nagricultural sector. Leading\nagricultural exports include\ndairy products, meat, forest\nproducts, fruit and vegetables,\nfish, and wool. New Zealand also\nhas substantial reserves of\nnatural gas, coal, and oil. As a\nresult, the New Zealand economy\nis susceptible to fluctuations in\ndemand for agricultural products\nand certain commodities. The New\nZealand economy is also becoming\nincreasingly dependent on its\ngrowing services industry.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return\nthe securities in a timely manner\nor at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse\ntax consequences for the Fund.\nBlackRock Institutional Trust\nCompany, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d ), the\nFund's securities lending agent,\nwill take into account the tax\nimpact to shareholders of\nsubstitute payments for dividends\nwhen managing the Fund's\nsecurities lending program.\nSmall-Capitalization Companies\nRisk. Stock prices of small-\ncapitalization companies may be\nmore volatile than those of\nlarger companies and, therefore,\nthe Fund's share price may be\nmore volatile than those of funds\nthat invest a larger percentage\nof their assets in stocks issued\nby mid- or large-capitalization\ncompanies. Stock prices of small-\ncapitalization companies are\ngenerally more vulnerable than\nthose of mid- or large-\ncapitalization companies to\nadverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies\nmay be thinly traded, making it\ndifficult for the Fund to buy and\nsell them. In addition, small-\ncapitalization companies are\ntypically less financially stable\nthan larger, more established\ncompanies and may depend on a\nsmall number of essential\npersonnel, making these companies\nmore vulnerable to experiencing\nadverse effects due to the loss\nof personnel. Small-\ncapitalization companies also\nnormally have less diverse\nproduct lines than those of mid-\nor large-capitalization companies\nand are more susceptible to\nadverse developments concerning\ntheir products. Tracking Error\nRisk. The Fund may be subject to\n\u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error\nmay occur because of differences\nbetween the securities and other\ninstruments held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index, pricing 14\ndifferences (including, as\napplicable, differences between a\nsecurity\u2019s price at the local\nmarket close and the Fund's\nvaluation of a security at the\ntime of calculation of the Fund's\nNAV), transaction costs incurred\nby the Fund, the Fund\u2019s holding\nof uninvested cash, differences\nin timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to the Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, the requirements to\nmaintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders, acceptance of\ncustom baskets, changes to the\nUnderlying Index or the costs to\nthe Fund of complying with\nvarious new or existing\nregulatory requirements, among\nother reasons. This risk may be\nheightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while the Underlying\nIndex does not. Tracking error\nmay occur due to differences\nbetween the methodologies used in\ncalculating the value of the\nUnderlying Index and determining\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV. U.S. Economic\nRisk. The U.S. is a significant,\nand in some cases the most\nsignificant, trading partner of,\nor foreign investor in, New\nZealand. As a result, economic\nconditions of New Zealand may be\nparticularly affected by changes\nin the U.S. economy. A decrease\nin U.S. imports or exports, new\ntrade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S.\ndollar exchange rate or an\neconomic slowdown in the U.S. may\nhave a material adverse effect on\nthe economic conditions of New\nZealand and, as a result,\nsecurities to which the Fund has\nexposure. Circumstances could\narise that could prevent the\ntimely payment of interest or\nprincipal on U.S. government\ndebt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system.\nValuation Risk. The price the\nFund could receive upon the sale\nof a security or other asset may\ndiffer from the Fund's valuation\nof the security or other asset\nand from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index, particularly\nfor securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or\nvolatile markets or that are\nvalued using a fair value\nmethodology as a result of trade\nsuspensions or for other reasons.\nBecause non-U.S. exchanges may be\nopen on days or during time\nperiods when the Fund does not\nprice its shares, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in\nthe Fund's portfolio may change\non days or during time periods\nwhen shareholders will not be\nable to purchase or sell the\nFund\u2019s shares. In addition, for\npurposes of calculating the\nFund's NAV, the value of assets\ndenominated in non-U.S.\ncurrencies is translated into\nU.S. dollars at the prevailing\nmarket rates. This translation\nmay result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to\ncalculate the Fund's NAV and the\nprices used by the Underlying\nIndex, which, in turn, could\nresult in a difference between\nthe Fund's performance and the\nperformance of the Underlying\nIndex. Authorized Participants\nwho purchase or redeem Fund\nshares on days when the Fund is\nholding fair-valued securities\nmay receive fewer or more shares,\nor lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities not\nbeen fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology.\nThe ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological\nissues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party\nservice providers. 15 A Further\nDiscussion of Other Risks The\nFund may also be subject to\ncertain other risks associated\nwith its investments and\ninvestment strategies. The order\nof the below risk factors does\nnot indicate the significance of\nany particular risk factor.\nBorrowing Risk. Borrowing may\nexaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio. Borrowing\nwill cost the Fund interest\nexpense and other fees. The costs\nof borrowing may reduce the\nFund\u2019s return. Borrowing may also\ncause the Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy\nits obligations. Close-Out Risk\nfor Qualified Financial\nContracts. Regulations adopted by\nglobal prudential regulators\nrequire counterparties that are\npart of U.S. or foreign global\nsystemically important banking\norganizations to include\ncontractual restrictions on\nclose-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified\nfinancial contracts. Qualified\nfinancial contracts include\nagreements relating to swaps,\ncurrency forwards and other\nderivatives as well as repurchase\nagreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions\nprevent the Fund from closing out\na qualified financial contract\nduring a specified time period if\nthe counterparty is subject to\nresolution proceedings and also\nprohibit the Fund from exercising\ndefault rights due to a\nreceivership or similar\nproceeding of an affiliate of the\ncounterparty. These requirements\nmay increase credit risk and\nother risks to the Fund.\nCommunication Services Sector\nRisk. The communication services\nsector consists of both companies\nin the telecommunication services\nindustry as well as those in the\nmedia and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the\ntelecommunication services\nindustry group include providers\nof fiber-optic, fixed-line,\ncellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks.\nCompanies in the media and\nentertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services\nand products including television\nbroadcasting, gaming products,\nsocial media, networking\nplatforms, online classifieds,\nonline review websites, and\nInternet search engines.\nCompanies in the communication\nservices sector may be affected\nby industry competition,\nsubstantial capital requirements,\ngovernment regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications\nproducts and services due to\ntechnological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and\ninternational demand, shifting\ndemographics and often\nunpredictable changes in consumer\ntastes can drastically affect a\ncommunication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while\nall companies may be susceptible\nto network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may\nbe particular targets of hacking\nand potential theft of\nproprietary or consumer\ninformation or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their\nbusinesses. The communication\nservices sector of a country\u2019s\neconomy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation.\nThe costs of complying with\ngovernmental regulations, delays\nor failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the\nenactment of new regulatory\nrequirements may negatively\naffect the business of\ncommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the\nworld, specifically in the area\nof pre-marketing clearance of\nproducts and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry\ncan also be significantly\naffected 16 by intense\ncompetition for market share,\nincluding competition with\nalternative technologies such as\nwireless communications, product\ncompatibility and\nstandardization, consumer\npreferences, rapid product\nobsolescence, research and\ndevelopment of new products, lack\nof standardization or\ncompatibility with existing\ntechnologies, and a dependency on\npatent and copyright protections.\nCompanies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter\ndistressed cash flows due to the\nneed to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in\ndeveloping new products and\nservices using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may\nmake the products and services of\ncertain communications companies\nobsolete. Telecommunications\nproviders with exposure to the\nU.S. are generally required to\nobtain franchises or licenses in\norder to provide services in a\ngiven location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the\ntelecommunications sector are\nlimited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain\nparticipants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high\nbarriers to market entry and\nregulatory oversight, among other\nfactors, have led to\nconsolidation of companies within\nthe sector, which could lead to\nfurther regulation or other\nnegative effects in the future.\nTelecommunication providers\ninvesting in non-U.S. countries\nmay be subject to similar risks.\nAdditional risks include those\nrelated to competitive challenges\nin the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic\njoint ventures with U.S.\ncompanies and in non-U.S. markets\nfrom both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment\nindustries can be significantly\naffected by several factors,\nincluding competition,\nparticularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new\ntechnologies, cyclicality of\nrevenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the\ndiscretionary income of targeted\nindividuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the\npotential increase in government\nregulation. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment\nindustries may become obsolete\nquickly. Advertising spending can\nbe an important revenue source\nfor media and entertainment\ncompanies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending\ntypically decreases and, as a\nresult, media and entertainment\ncompanies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk. Investing in dividend-\npaying stocks involves the risk\nthat such stocks may fall out of\nfavor with investors and\nunderperform the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-\npaying stocks are not required to\npay or continue paying dividends\non such stocks. It is possible\nthat issuers of the stocks held\nby the Fund will not declare\ndividends in the future or will\nreduce or eliminate the payment\nof dividends (including reducing\nor eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the\npayment of dividends) in the\nfuture. Financial Companies Risk.\nFinancial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental\nregulation and intervention,\nwhich may change frequently and\nmay adversely affect their\nprofitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and\nliquid assets they must maintain\nand their size, among other\nthings. Financial services\ncompanies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among\nother things, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, credit\nrating downgrades, adverse public\nperception and exposure\nconcentration. Increased risk-\ntaking by financial companies may\nresult in greater overall risk in\nthe global financial sector. 17\nCertain events may cause an\nunusually high degree of\nvolatility in financial markets\nand pose the risk of large losses\nfor financial services companies.\nFinancial companies frequently\noperate with substantial\nfinancial leverage and are\nexposed directly to the credit\nrisk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, which also may be\nleveraged to an unknown degree.\nFinancial companies may have\nsignificant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties; as\na result, a borrower\u2019s or\ncounterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company\nmay affect other financial\ncompanies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty.\nThis interconnectedness of risk\nmay result in significant\nnegative impacts to companies\nwith direct exposure to the\ndefaulting counterparty as well\nas adverse cascading effects in\nthe markets and the financial\nsector generally. Illiquid\nInvestments Risk. The Fund may\nnot acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after\nthe acquisition, the Fund would\nhave invested more than 15% of\nits net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that\nthe Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in\nseven calendar days or less\nwithout significantly changing\nthe market value of the\ninvestment. Liquid investments\nmay become illiquid after\npurchase by the Fund,\nparticularly during periods of\nmarket turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or\ninstrument that is deemed to be\nliquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long\nas it is held by the Fund, and\nany security or instrument held\nby the Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to\nthe Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent\nthe Fund holds illiquid\ninvestments, the illiquid\ninvestments may reduce the\nreturns of the Fund because the\nFund may be unable to transact at\nadvantageous times or prices. An\ninvestment may be illiquid due\nto, among other things, the\nreduced number and capacity of\ntraditional market participants\nto make a market in securities or\ninstruments, the lack of an\nactive market for such securities\nor instruments, capital controls,\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof local currency, or insolvency\nof local governments. To the\nextent that the Fund invests in\nsecurities or instruments with\nsubstantial market and/or credit\nrisk, the Fund will tend to have\nincreased exposure to the risks\nassociated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid investments\nmay be harder to value,\nespecially in changing markets.\nAlthough the Fund primarily seeks\nto redeem shares of the Fund on\nan in-kind basis, if the Fund is\nforced to sell underlying\ninvestments at reduced prices or\nunder unfavorable conditions to\nmeet redemption requests or for\nother cash needs, the Fund may\nsuffer a loss. This may be\nmagnified in a rising interest\nrate environment or other\ncircumstances where redemptions\nfrom the Fund may be greater than\nnormal. Other market participants\nmay be attempting to liquidate\nholdings at the same time as the\nFund, causing increased supply of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying investments\nin the market and contributing to\nilliquid investments risk and\ndownward pricing pressure. In\naddition, if the Fund is limited\nin its ability to sell illiquid\ninvestments during periods when\nshareholders are redeeming their\nshares, the Fund will need to\nsell liquid securities to meet\nredemption requests and illiquid\nsecurities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings.\nDuring periods of market\nvolatility, liquidity in the\nmarket for the Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe impacted by the liquidity in\nthe market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by\nthe Fund, which could lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a\npremium or discount to the Fund's\nNAV. 18 Large Shareholder and\nLarge-Scale Redemption Risk.\nCertain shareholders, including\nan Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser or an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, a market maker,\nor another entity, may from time\nto time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares\nor may invest in the Fund and\nhold their investment for a\nlimited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or\nloan Fund shares (to secure\nfinancing or otherwise), which\nmay result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party.\nThere can be no assurance that\nany large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment or that\nthe size of the Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares by\nthese shareholders may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s liquidity and\nnet assets. To the extent the\nFund permits redemptions in cash,\nthese redemptions may force the\nFund to sell portfolio securities\nwhen it might not otherwise do\nso, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material\neffect on the market price of the\nShares and increase the Fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs and/or accelerate\nthe realization of taxable income\nand/or gains and cause the Fund\nto make taxable distributions to\nits shareholders earlier than the\nFund otherwise would have. In\naddition, under certain\ncircumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as\nreceiving a disproportionately\nlarge taxable distribution during\nor with respect to such tax year.\nThe Fund also may be required to\nsell its more liquid Fund\ninvestments to meet a large\nredemption, in which case the\nFund\u2019s remaining assets may be\nless liquid, more volatile, and\nmore difficult to price. To the\nextent these large shareholders\ntransact in shares on the\nsecondary market, such\ntransactions may account for a\nlarge percentage of the trading\nvolume for the shares of the Fund\nand may, therefore, have a\nmaterial upward or downward\neffect on the market price of the\nFund shares. In addition, large\npurchases of Fund shares may\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to the extent that\nthe Fund is delayed in investing\nnew cash and is required to\nmaintain a larger cash position\nthan it ordinarily would,\ndiluting its investment returns.\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk.\nIf certain aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel ownership thresholds are\nreached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates\nor the Fund, or as a result of\nthird-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or\nregulator, the ability of BFA and\nits affiliates on behalf of\nclients (including the Fund) to\npurchase or dispose of\ninvestments, or exercise rights\nor undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted\nby regulation or otherwise\nimpaired. The capacity of the\nFund to make investments in\ncertain securities may be\naffected by the relevant\nthreshold limits, and such\nlimitations may have adverse\neffects on the liquidity and\nperformance of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings compared to\nthe performance of the Underlying\nIndex. This may increase the risk\nof the Fund being underinvested\nto the Underlying Index and\nincrease the risk of tracking\nerror. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Fund\ninvests in securities issued by\ncompanies that operate in certain\nregulated industries or in\ncertain emerging or international\nmarkets, is subject to corporate\nor regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invests in\ncertain futures or other\nderivative transactions, there\nmay be limits on the aggregate\nand/or fund-level amount invested\nor voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts\n(including the Fund) that may not\nbe exceeded without the grant of\na license or other regulatory or\ncorporate consent or, if 19\nexceeded, may cause BFA and its\naffiliates, the Fund or other\nclient accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business\nrestrictions. Utilities Sector\nRisk. The Fund invests in\ncompanies in New Zealand's\nutilities sector, which may be\nadversely affected by changes in\nexchange rates and domestic and\ninternational competition.\nCompanies in the utilities sector\nmay be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates,\ndomestic and international\ncompetition, and governmental\nlimitations on rates charged to\nconsumers. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to\na lesser extent, equity\nsecurities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the\nmovement of interest rates.\nDeregulation may subject utility\ncompanies to greater competition\nand may adversely affect their\nprofitability. As deregulation\nallows utility companies to\ndiversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and\ntheir traditional lines of\nbusiness, utility companies may\nengage in riskier ventures. In\naddition, deregulation may\neliminate restrictions on the\nprofits of certain utility\ncompanies, but may also subject\nthese companies to greater risk\nof loss. Companies in the\nutilities industry may have\ndifficulty obtaining an adequate\nreturn on invested capital,\nraising capital, or financing\nlarge construction projects\nduring periods of inflation or\nunsettled capital markets; face\nrestrictions on operations and\nincreased cost and delays\nattributable to environmental\nconsiderations and regulation;\nfind that existing plants,\nequipment or products have been\nrendered obsolete by\ntechnological innovations; or be\nsubject to increased costs\nbecause of the scarcity of\ncertain fuels or the effects of\nman-made or natural disasters.\nExisting and future regulations\nor legislation may make it\ndifficult for utility companies\nto operate profitably. Government\nregulators monitor and control\nutility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility\nprofits. In certain countries,\nregulatory authorities may also\nrestrict utility companies\u2019\naccess to new markets, thereby\ndiminishing these companies\u2019\nlong-term prospects. There is no\nassurance that regulatory\nauthorities will grant rate\nincreases in the future or that\nsuch increases will be adequate\nto permit the payment of\ndividends on stocks issued by a\nutility company. Energy\nconservation and changes in\nclimate policy may also have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the\nrevenues and expenses of utility\ncompanies. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation A description of the\nTrust's policies and procedures\nwith respect to the disclosure of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio securities\nis available in the Fund's\nStatement of Additional\nInformation ( \u201c SAI \u201d ). The Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com. Fund\nfact sheets providing information\nregarding the Fund's top holdings\nare posted on www.iShares.com\nwhen available and may be\nrequested by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\nManagement Investment Adviser. As\ninvestment adviser, BFA has\noverall responsibility for the\ngeneral management and\nadministration of the Fund. BFA\nprovides an investment program\nfor the Fund and manages the\ninvestment of the Fund\u2019s assets.\nIn managing the Fund, BFA may\ndraw upon the research and\nexpertise of its asset management\naffiliates with respect to\ncertain portfolio securities. In\nseeking to achieve the Fund's 20\ninvestment objective, BFA uses\nteams of portfolio managers,\ninvestment strategists and other\ninvestment specialists. This team\napproach brings together many\ndisciplines and leverages BFA\u2019s\nextensive resources. Pursuant to\nthe Investment Advisory Agreement\nbetween BFA and the Trust\n(entered into on behalf of the\nFund), BFA is responsible for\nsubstantially all expenses of the\nFund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition\nof portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses\nand any extraordinary expenses\n(as determined by a majority of\nthe Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the\nTrust). Operating expenses paid\nby BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude\nacquired fund fees and expenses,\nif any. For its investment\nadvisory services to the Fund,\nBFA is paid a management fee from\nthe Fund corresponding to the\nFund\u2019s allocable portion of an\naggregate management fee\ncalculated based on the aggregate\naverage daily net assets of the\nfollowing iShares funds: iShares\nMSCI Australia ETF, iShares MSCI\nAustria ETF, iShares MSCI Belgium\nETF, iShares MSCI Canada ETF,\niShares MSCI Eurozone ETF,\niShares MSCI France ETF, iShares\nMSCI Germany ETF, iShares MSCI\nHong Kong ETF, iShares MSCI\nIreland ETF, iShares MSCI Italy\nETF, iShares MSCI Japan ETF,\niShares MSCI Japan Small-Cap ETF,\niShares MSCI Malaysia ETF,\niShares MSCI Mexico ETF, iShares\nMSCI Netherlands ETF, iShares\nMSCI New Zealand ETF, iShares\nMSCI Singapore ETF, iShares MSCI\nSpain ETF, iShares MSCI Sweden\nETF, iShares MSCI Switzerland ETF\nand iShares MSCI United Kingdom\nETF. The aggregate management fee\nis calculated as follows: 0.59%\nper annum of the aggregate net\nassets less than or equal to $7.0\nbillion, plus 0.54% per annum of\nthe aggregate net assets over\n$7.0 billion, up to and including\n$11.0 billion, plus 0.49% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets\nover $11.0 billion, up to and\nincluding $24.0 billion, plus\n0.44% per annum of the aggregate\nnet assets over $24.0 billion, up\nto and including $48.0 billion,\nplus 0.40% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $48.0\nbillion, up to and including\n$72.0 billion, plus 0.36% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets\nover $72.0 billion, up to and\nincluding $96.0 billion, plus\n0.32% per annum of the aggregate\nnet assets in excess of $96.0\nbillion. For the fiscal year\nended August 31, 2023, BFA was\npaid a management fee from the\nFund, as a percentage of the\nFund\u2019s average daily net assets,\nat the annual rate of 0.50%. BFA\nmay from time to time voluntarily\nwaive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses in order to limit total\nannual fund operating expenses\n(excluding acquired fund fees and\nexpenses, if any). Any such\nvoluntary waiver or reimbursement\nmay be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime. BFA is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA\n94105. It is an indirect wholly-\nowned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ). As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, BFA and its\naffiliates provided investment\nadvisory services for assets of\napproximately $9.1 trillion. BFA\nand its affiliates trade and\ninvest for their own accounts in\nthe actual securities and types\nof securities in which the Fund\nmay also invest, which may affect\nthe price of such securities. 21\nA discussion regarding the basis\nfor the approval by the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d\n) of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement with BFA is available\nin the Fund's Annual Report for\nthe period ended August 31.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer\nHsui, Greg Savage and Paul\nWhitehead are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. The\nPortfolio Managers are\nresponsible for various functions\nrelated to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninvesting cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of\ntheir respective portfolio\nmanagement teams to focus on\ncertain asset classes,\nimplementing investment strategy,\nresearching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and\noverseeing members of their\nrespective portfolio management\nteams who have more limited\nresponsibilities. Jennifer Hsui\nhas been employed by BFA or its\naffiliates as a senior portfolio\nmanager since 2007. Prior to\nthat, Ms. Hsui was a portfolio\nmanager from 2006 to 2007 for\nBarclays Global Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBGFA \u201d ). Ms. Hsui has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund\nsince 2012. Greg Savage has been\nemployed by BFA or its affiliates\nas a senior portfolio manager\nsince 2006. Prior to that, Mr.\nSavage was a portfolio manager\nfrom 2001 to 2006 for BGFA. Mr.\nSavage has been a Portfolio\nManager of the Fund since 2010.\nPaul Whitehead has been with\nBlackRock since 1996, including\nhis years with Barclays Global\nInvestors ( \u201c BGI \u201d ), which\nmerged with BlackRock in 2009.\nMr. Whitehead has been employed\nby BlackRock as a Managing\nDirector since 2010 and a\nDirector from 2009 to 2010. Mr.\nWhitehead was employed by BGI as\nPrincipal from 2002 to 2009. Mr.\nWhitehead has been a Portfolio\nManager of the Fund since 2022.\nThe Fund's SAI provides\nadditional information about the\nPortfolio Managers' compensation,\nother accounts managed by the\nPortfolio Managers and the\nPortfolio Managers' ownership (if\nany) of shares in the Fund.\nAdministrator, Custodian and\nTransfer Agent. State Street Bank\nand Trust Company ( \u201c State\nStreet \u201d ) is the administrator,\ncustodian and transfer agent for\nthe Fund. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. serves as custodian for the\nFund in connection with certain\nsecurities lending activities.\nConflicts of Interest. The\ninvestment activities of BFA and\nits affiliates (including\nBlackRock and its subsidiaries\n(collectively, the \u201c Affiliates \u201d\n)), and their respective\ndirectors, officers or employees,\nin the management of, or their\ninterest in, their own accounts\nand other accounts they manage,\nmay present conflicts of interest\nthat could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. BFA and its\nAffiliates provide investment\nmanagement services to other\nfunds and discretionary managed\naccounts that may follow\ninvestment programs similar to\nthat of the Fund. BFA and its\nAffiliates are involved worldwide\nwith a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset\nmanagement activities and may\nengage in the ordinary course of\nbusiness in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests\nof their clients may conflict\nwith those of the Fund. BFA or\none or more Affiliates act, or\nmay act, as an investor, research\nprovider, investment manager,\ncommodity pool operator,\ncommodity trading advisor,\nfinancier, underwriter, adviser,\ntrader, lender, index provider,\nagent and/or principal, and have\nother direct and indirect\ninterests in securities,\ncurrencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other 22\ninstruments in which the Fund may\ndirectly or indirectly invest.\nThe Fund may invest in securities\nof, or engage in other\ntransactions with, companies with\nwhich an Affiliate has\nsignificant debt or equity\ninvestments or other interests.\nThe Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured\nnotes) by entities for which an\nAffiliate provides and is\ncompensated for cash management\nservices relating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances.\nThe Fund also may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in other\ntransactions with, companies for\nwhich an Affiliate provides or\nmay in the future provide\nresearch coverage. An Affiliate\nmay have business relationships\nwith, and purchase or distribute\nor sell services or products from\nor to, distributors, consultants\nor others who recommend the Fund\nor who engage in transactions\nwith or for the Fund, and may\nreceive compensation for such\nservices. BFA or one or more\nAffiliates may engage in\nproprietary trading and advise\naccounts and funds that have\ninvestment objectives similar to\nthose of the Fund and/or that\nengage in and compete for\ntransactions in the same types of\nsecurities, currencies and other\ninstruments as the Fund. This may\ninclude transactions in\nsecurities issued by other open-\nend and closed-end investment\ncompanies (which may include\ninvestment companies that are\naffiliated with the Fund and BFA,\nto the extent permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940,\nas amended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d )).\nThe trading activities of BFA and\nthese Affiliates are carried out\nwithout reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by\nthe Fund and may result in BFA or\nan Affiliate having positions in\ncertain securities that are\nsenior or junior to, or have\ninterests different from or\nadverse to, the securities that\nare owned by the Fund. Neither\nBlackRock nor any Affiliate is\nunder any obligation to share any\ninvestment opportunity, idea or\nstrategy with the Fund. As a\nresult, an Affiliate may compete\nwith the Fund for appropriate\ninvestment opportunities. The\nresults of the Fund's investment\nactivities, therefore, may differ\nfrom those of an Affiliate and of\nother accounts managed by\nBlackRock or an Affiliate, and it\nis possible that the Fund could\nsustain losses during periods in\nwhich one or more Affiliates and\nother accounts achieve profits on\ntheir trading for proprietary or\nother accounts. The opposite\nresult is also possible. In\naddition, the Fund may, from time\nto time, enter into transactions\nin which BFA or an Affiliate or\nits or their directors, officers,\nemployees or clients have an\nadverse interest. Furthermore,\ntransactions undertaken by\nclients advised or managed by BFA\nor its Affiliates may adversely\nimpact the Fund. Transactions by\none or more clients or by BFA or\nits Affiliates or their\ndirectors, officers or employees\nmay have the effect of diluting\nor otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment\nstrategies of the Fund. The\nFund's activities may be limited\nbecause of regulatory\nrestrictions applicable to BFA or\none or more Affiliates and/or\ntheir internal policies designed\nto comply with such restrictions.\nUnder a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board,\nthe Fund has retained BTC, an\nAffiliate of BFA, to serve as the\nsecurities lending agent for the\nFund to the extent that the Fund\nparticipates in the securities\nlending program. For these\nservices, the securities lending\nagent will receive a fee from the\nFund, based on the returns earned\non the Fund\u2019s lending activities,\nincluding investment of the cash\nreceived as collateral 23 for the\nloaned securities. In addition,\none or more Affiliates may be\namong the entities to which the\nFund may lend its portfolio\nsecurities under the securities\nlending program. It is also\npossible that, from time to time,\nBlackRock and/or its advisory\nclients (including other funds\nand separately managed accounts)\nmay, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold\nshares of the Fund. The price,\navailability, liquidity, and (in\nsome cases) expense ratio of the\nFund may be impacted by purchases\nand sales of the Fund by\nBlackRock and/or its advisory\nclients. The activities of BFA\nand its Affiliates and their\nrespective directors, officers or\nemployees may give rise to other\nconflicts of interest that could\ndisadvantage the Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted\npolicies and procedures designed\nto address these potential\nconflicts of interest. See the\nSAI for further information.\nShareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy\nand sell shares of the Fund, is\navailable free of charge by\ncalling toll-free: 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting our\nwebsite at www.iShares.com.\nBuying and Selling Shares. Shares\nof the Fund may be acquired or\nredeemed directly from the Fund\nonly in Creation Units or\nmultiples thereof, as discussed\nin the Creations and Redemptions\nsection of this Prospectus. Only\nan Authorized Participant may\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. Once created, shares of the\nFund generally trade in the\nsecondary market in amounts less\nthan a Creation Unit. Shares of\nthe Fund are listed on a national\nsecurities exchange for trading\nduring the trading day. Shares\ncan be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day like shares of\nother publicly traded companies.\nThe Trust does not impose any\nminimum investment for shares of\nthe Fund purchased on an exchange\nor otherwise in the secondary\nmarket. The Fund's shares trade\nunder the ticker symbol \u201c ENZL. \u201d\nBuying or selling Fund shares on\nan exchange or other secondary\nmarket involves two types of\ncosts that may apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling shares of the\nFund through a broker, you may\nincur a brokerage commission and\nother charges. The commission is\nfrequently a fixed amount and may\nbe a significant proportional\ncost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell small amounts of shares.\nIn addition, you may incur the\ncost of the \u201c spread, \u201d that is,\nany difference between the bid\nprice and the ask price. The\nspread varies over time for\nshares of the Fund based on the\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market\nliquidity, and is generally lower\nif the Fund has high trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and\nhigher if the Fund has little\ntrading volume and market\nliquidity (which is often the\ncase for funds that are newly\nlaunched or small in size). The\nFund's spread may also be\nimpacted by the liquidity or\nilliquidity of the underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund,\nparticularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds or in instances\nof significant volatility of the\nunderlying securities. The Fund\ndoes not impose restrictions on\nthe frequency of purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with the Fund. The Board\ndetermined not to adopt policies\nand procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent\npurchases and redemptions of 24\nFund shares because the Fund\ngenerally sells and redeems its\nshares directly through\ntransactions that are in-kind\nand/or for cash, with a deadline\nfor placing cash-related\ntransactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets for\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio securities.\nHowever, the Fund has taken\ncertain measures ( e.g .,\nimposing transaction fees on\npurchases and redemptions of\nCreation Units and reserving the\nright to reject purchases of\nCreation Units under certain\ncircumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of\nfrequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased\ntracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution to\nthe Fund, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the\nvast majority of trading in Fund\nshares occurs on the secondary\nmarket, which does not involve\nthe Fund directly, and such\ntrading is unlikely to cause many\nof the harmful effects of\nfrequent cash purchases or\nredemptions of Fund shares. The\nnational securities exchange on\nwhich the Fund's shares are\nlisted is open for trading Monday\nthrough Friday and is closed on\nweekends and the following\nholidays (or the days on which\nthey are observed): New Year\u2019s\nDay, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents\u2019 Day, Good Friday,\nMemorial Day, Juneteenth,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. The Fund\u2019s primary listing\nexchange is Nasdaq. Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments\nby investment companies,\nincluding foreign and\nunregistered investment\ncompanies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For\nexample, a registered investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Fund, may not\nknowingly sell or otherwise\ndispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any\ninvestment company (the \u201c\nAcquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company\nor companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately\nafter such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the\nAcquired Fund is owned by the\nAcquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund, or (ii) more than\n10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund\nand other investment companies\nand companies controlled by them.\nHowever, registered investment\ncompanies are permitted to invest\nin the Fund beyond the limits set\nforth in Section 12(d)(1),\nsubject to certain terms and\nconditions set forth in SEC\nrules. In order for a registered\ninvestment company to invest in\nshares of the Fund beyond the\nlimitations of Section 12(d)(1)\nin reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under\nthe 1940 Act, the registered\ninvestment company must, among\nother things, enter into an\nagreement with the Trust. Foreign\ninvestment companies are\npermitted to invest in the Fund\nonly up to the limits set forth\nin Section 12(d)(1), subject to\nany applicable SEC no-action\nrelief. Book Entry. Shares of the\nFund are held in book-entry form,\nwhich means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The\nDepository Trust Company ( \u201c DTC\n\u201d ) or its nominee is the record\nowner of, and holds legal title\nto, all outstanding shares of the\nFund. Investors owning shares of\nthe Fund are beneficial owners as\nshown on the records of DTC or\nits participants. DTC serves as\nthe securities depository for\nshares of the Fund. DTC\nparticipants include securities\nbrokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations\nand other institutions that\ndirectly or indirectly maintain a\ncustodial relationship with DTC.\nAs a beneficial owner of shares,\nyou are not entitled to receive\nphysical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares\nregistered in your 25 name, and\nyou are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares.\nTherefore, to exercise any right\nas an owner of shares, you must\nrely upon the procedures of DTC\nand its participants. These\nprocedures are the same as those\nthat apply to any other\nsecurities that you hold in book-\nentry or \u201c street name \u201d form.\nShare Prices. The trading prices\nof the Fund\u2019s shares in the\nsecondary market generally differ\nfrom the Fund\u2019s daily NAV and are\naffected by market forces such as\nthe supply of and demand for ETF\nshares and shares of underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund,\neconomic conditions and other\nfactors. Determination of Net\nAsset Value. The NAV of the Fund\nnormally is determined once daily\nMonday through Friday, generally\nas of the close of regular\ntrading hours of the New York\nStock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d )\n(normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern\ntime) on each day that the NYSE\nis open for trading, based on\nprices at the time of closing,\nprovided that any Fund assets or\nliabilities denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S.\ndollar are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market\nrates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data\nservice providers. The NAV of the\nFund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the net assets of\nthe Fund ( i.e. , the value of\nits total assets less total\nliabilities) by the total number\nof outstanding shares of the\nFund, generally rounded to the\nnearest cent. The value of the\nsecurities and other assets and\nliabilities held by the Fund is\ndetermined pursuant to BFA\u2019s\nvaluation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the\nvaluation designee for the Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the\n1940 Act. Equity securities and\nother equity instruments for\nwhich market quotations are\nreadily available are valued at\nmarket value, which is generally\ndetermined using the last\nreported official closing price\nor, if a reported closing price\nis not available, the last traded\nprice on the exchange or market\non which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at\nthe time of valuation. Shares of\nunderlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds)\nare valued at net asset value.\nShares of underlying exchange-\ntraded closed-end funds or other\nETFs are valued at their most\nrecent closing price. Generally,\ntrading in non-U.S. securities\nand money market instruments is\nsubstantially completed each day\nat various times prior to the\nclose of regular trading hours of\nthe NYSE. The values of such\nsecurities used in computing the\nNAV of the Fund are determined as\nof such times. When market\nquotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA\nto be unreliable, BFA will fair\nvalue the Fund\u2019s investments in\naccordance with its policies and\nprocedures. BFA may conclude that\na market quotation is not readily\navailable or is unreliable if a\nsecurity or other asset or\nliability does not have a price\nsource due to its lack of trading\nor other reasons, if a market\nquotation differs significantly\nfrom recent price quotations or\notherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value, where the\nsecurity or other asset or\nliability is thinly traded, when\nthere is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent\nmarket quotation, or if the\ntrading market on which a\nsecurity is listed is suspended\nor closed and no appropriate\nalternative trading market is\navailable. A \u201c significant event\n\u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable 26\nbusiness judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, that the\nevent is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last\nexchange closing price or closing\nmarket price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities\nof, the Fund. For certain foreign\nassets, a third-party vendor\nsupplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-\nfactor model after the relevant\nforeign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to\ncorrelate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S.\nmarkets following the close of\nthe local markets to the prices\nthat might have prevailed as of\nthe Fund\u2019s pricing time. Fair\nvalue represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair\nvalue of an asset or liability\nheld by the Fund is the amount\nthe Fund might reasonably expect\nto receive from the current sale\nof that asset or the cost to\nextinguish that liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. Valuing\nthe Fund\u2019s investments using fair\nvalue pricing will result in\nprices that may differ from\ncurrent market valuations and\nthat may not be the prices at\nwhich those investments could\nhave been sold during the period\nin which the particular fair\nvalues were used. Use of fair\nvalue prices and certain current\nmarket valuations could result in\na difference between the prices\nused to calculate the Fund\u2019s NAV\nand the prices used by the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn,\ncould result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Dividends and\nDistributions. General Policies.\nDividends from net investment\nincome, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid at least once a\nyear by the Fund. Distributions\nof net realized securities gains,\nif any, generally are declared\nand paid once a year, but the\nTrust may make distributions on a\nmore frequent basis for the Fund.\nThe Trust reserves the right to\ndeclare special distributions if,\nin its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or\nadvisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company\n( \u201c RIC \u201d ) or to avoid\nimposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or\nrealized gains. Dividends and\nother distributions on shares of\nthe Fund are distributed on a pro\nrata basis to beneficial owners\nof such shares. Dividend payments\nare made through DTC participants\nand indirect participants to\nbeneficial owners then of record\nwith proceeds received from the\nFund. Dividend Reinvestment\nService. No dividend reinvestment\nservice is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make available\nthe DTC book-entry Dividend\nReinvestment Service for use by\nbeneficial owners of the Fund for\nreinvestment of their dividend\ndistributions. Beneficial owners\nshould contact their broker to\ndetermine the availability and\ncosts of the service and the\ndetails of participation therein.\nBrokers may require beneficial\nowners to adhere to specific\nprocedures and timetables. If\nthis service is available and\nused, dividend distributions of\nboth income and realized gains\nwill be automatically reinvested\nin additional whole shares of the\nFund purchased in the secondary\nmarket. Note on Tax Information.\nThe following sections summarize\nsome of the consequences under\ncurrent U.S. federal tax law of\nan investment in the Fund. It is\nnot a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. You may also be subject\nto state and local taxation on\nFund 27 distributions and sales\nof shares. Certain states and\nlocalities may exempt from tax\ndistributions attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal\ngovernment obligations. Consult\nyour personal tax advisor about\nthe potential tax consequences of\nan investment in shares of the\nFund under all applicable tax\nlaws. Taxes. As with any\ninvestment, you should consider\nhow your investment in shares of\nthe Fund will be taxed. The tax\ninformation in this Prospectus is\nprovided as general information,\nbased on current law. You should\nconsult your own tax professional\nabout the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of the Fund.\nUnless your investment in Fund\nshares is made through a tax-\nexempt entity or tax-deferred\nretirement account, such as an\nIRA, in which case your\ndistributions generally will be\ntaxable when withdrawn, you need\nto be aware of the possible tax\nconsequences when the Fund makes\ndistributions or you sell Fund\nshares. Taxes on Distributions.\nDistributions from the Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than\nqualified dividend income),\nincluding distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and\ndistributions out of the Fund\u2019s\nnet short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as\nordinary income. Distributions by\nthe Fund of net long-term capital\ngains, if any, in excess of net\nshort-term capital losses\n(capital gain dividends) are\ntaxable to you as long-term\ncapital gains, regardless of how\nlong you have held the Fund\u2019s\nshares. Distributions by the Fund\nthat qualify as qualified\ndividend income are taxable to\nyou at long-term capital gain\nrates. Long-term capital gains\nand qualified dividend income are\ngenerally eligible for taxation\nat a maximum rate of 15% or 20%\nfor non-corporate shareholders,\ndepending on whether their income\nexceeds certain threshold\namounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S.\nfederal Medicare contribution tax\nis imposed on \u201c net investment\nincome, \u201d including, but not\nlimited to, interest, dividends,\nand net gain, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000\n(or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates\nand trusts. Dividends will be\nqualified dividend income to you\nif they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income\nreceived by the Fund. Generally,\nqualified dividend income\nincludes dividend income from\ntaxable U.S. corporations and\nqualified non-U.S. corporations,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period\nrequirements in respect of the\nstock of such corporations and\nhas not hedged its position in\nthe stock in certain ways.\nSubstitute dividends received by\nthe Fund with respect to\ndividends paid on securities lent\nout will not be qualified\ndividend income. For this\npurpose, a qualified non-U.S.\ncorporation means any non-U.S.\ncorporation that is eligible for\nbenefits under a comprehensive\nincome tax treaty with the U.S.,\nwhich includes an exchange of\ninformation program, or if the\nstock with respect to which the\ndividend was paid is readily\ntradable on an established U.S.\nsecurities market. The term\nexcludes a corporation that is a\npassive foreign investment\ncompany. Under current Internal\nRevenue Service ( \u201c IRS \u201d )\nguidance, the U.S. has a\ncomprehensive income tax treaty\nwith New Zealand. Dividends\nreceived by the Fund from a RIC\ngenerally are qualified dividend\nincome only to the extent such\ndividend distributions are made\nout of qualified dividend income\nreceived by such RIC.\nAdditionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by the Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a\nshareholder generally will be\ntaxable to the shareholder as\nordinary income. However, for tax\nyears beginning after December\n31, 28 2017 and before January 1,\n2026, the Fund may report\ndividends eligible for a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d\ndeduction for non-corporate U.S.\nshareholders to the extent the\nFund\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends, reduced\nby allocable Fund expenses. For a\ndividend to be treated as\nqualified dividend income, the\ndividend must be received with\nrespect to a share of stock held\nwithout being hedged by the Fund,\nand with respect to a share of\nthe Fund held without being\nhedged by you, for 61 days during\nthe 121-day period beginning at\nthe date which is 60 days before\nthe date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividend or, in the case\nof certain preferred stock, 91\ndays during the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such\ndate. Fund distributions, to the\nextent attributable to dividends\nfrom U.S. corporations, will be\neligible for the dividends\nreceived deduction for Fund\nshareholders that are\ncorporations, subject to certain\nhedging and holding requirements.\nIn general, your distributions\nare subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax for the year when they\nare paid. Certain distributions\npaid in January, however, may be\ntreated as paid on December 31 of\nthe prior year. If the Fund\u2019s\ndistributions exceed current and\naccumulated earnings and profits,\nall or a portion of the\ndistributions made in the taxable\nyear may be recharacterized as a\nreturn of capital to\nshareholders. Distributions in\nexcess of the Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but\nnot in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will\nnot constitute nontaxable returns\nof capital. A return of capital\ndistribution generally will not\nbe taxable but will reduce the\nshareholder\u2019s cost basis and\nresult in a higher capital gain\nor lower capital loss when those\nshares on which the distribution\nwas received are sold. Once a\nshareholder's cost basis is\nreduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as\ncapital gain, if the shareholder\nholds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets. Dividends,\ninterest and capital gains earned\nby the Fund with respect to\nsecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers may give rise to\nwithholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S.\ncountries. Tax conventions\nbetween certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If more than 50% of the\ntotal assets of the Fund at the\nclose of a year consists of\nnon-U.S. stocks or securities\n(generally, for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter\nwhere traded, of non-U.S.\ncompanies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ), generally the Fund\nmay \u201c pass through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes\n(including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund. This means that\nyou would be considered to have\nreceived as an additional\ndividend your share of such\nnon-U.S. taxes, but you may be\nentitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in\ncalculating your taxable income,\nor, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in\ncalculating your U.S. federal\nincome tax. For purposes of\nforeign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of the Fund, foreign\ncapital gains taxes may not\nproduce associated foreign source\nincome, limiting the availability\nof such credits for U.S. persons.\nIf you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you\nare a non-U.S. entity (other than\na pass-through entity to the\nextent owned by U.S. persons),\nthe Fund\u2019s 29 ordinary income\ndividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term\ncapital gains) will generally be\nsubject to a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax, unless a lower treaty rate\napplies, provided that\nwithholding tax will generally\nnot apply to any gain or income\nrealized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder in respect of any\ndistributions of long-term\ncapital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of shares of\nthe Fund. Separately, a 30%\nwithholding tax is currently\nimposed on U.S.-source dividends,\ninterest and other income items\npaid to (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S.\ninvestment funds, unless they\nagree to collect and disclose to\nthe IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S.\naccount holders and (ii) certain\nother foreign entities, unless\nthey certify certain information\nregarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid\nwithholding, foreign financial\ninstitutions will need to (i)\nenter into agreements with the\nIRS that state that they will\nprovide the IRS information,\nincluding the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification\nnumbers of direct and indirect\nU.S. account holders, comply with\ndue diligence procedures with\nrespect to the identification of\nU.S. accounts, report to the IRS\ncertain information with respect\nto U.S. accounts maintained,\nagree to withhold tax on certain\npayments made to non-compliant\nforeign financial institutions or\nto account holders who fail to\nprovide the required information,\nand determine certain other\ninformation concerning their\naccount holders, or (ii) in the\nevent that an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are\nadopted, provide local revenue\nauthorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign\nentities may need to report the\nname, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each\nsubstantial U.S. owner or provide\ncertifications of no substantial\nU.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. If your Fund\nshares are loaned out pursuant to\na securities lending arrangement,\nyou may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends paid while the\nshares are held by the borrower\nas qualified dividend income. In\naddition, you may lose the\nability to use foreign tax\ncredits passed through by the\nFund if your Fund shares are\nloaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending agreement. If\nyou are a resident or a citizen\nof the U.S., by law, backup\nwithholding at a 24% rate will\napply to your distributions and\nproceeds if you have not provided\na taxpayer identification number\nor social security number and\nmade other required\ncertifications. Taxes When Shares\nAre Sold. Currently, any capital\ngain or loss realized upon a sale\nof Fund shares is generally\ntreated as a long-term gain or\nloss if the shares have been held\nfor more than one year. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund shares held\nfor one year or less is generally\ntreated as short-term gain or\nloss, except that any capital\nloss on the sale of shares held\nfor six months or less is treated\nas long-term capital loss to the\nextent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect\nto such shares. Any such capital\ngains, including from sales of\nFund shares or from capital gain\ndividends, are included in \u201c net\ninvestment income \u201d for purposes\nof the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions. Prior\nto trading in the secondary\nmarket, shares of the Fund are \u201c\ncreated \u201d at NAV by market\nmakers, large investors and\ninstitutions only in block-size\nCreation Units or multiples\nthereof. Each \u201c creator \u201d or\nauthorized participant (an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d ) has\nentered into an agreement with\nthe Fund's distributor, BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an\naffiliate of BFA. An 30\nAuthorized Participant is a\nmember or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with\nthe SEC, which has a written\nagreement with the Fund or one of\nits service providers that allows\nsuch member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and\nredemption of Creation Units. A\ncreation transaction, which is\nsubject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the Fund,\ngenerally takes place when an\nAuthorized Participant deposits\ninto the Fund a designated\nportfolio of securities, assets\nor other positions (a \u201c creation\nbasket \u201d ), and an amount of cash\n(including any cash representing\nthe value of substituted\nsecurities, assets or other\npositions), if any, which\ntogether approximate the holdings\nof the Fund in exchange for a\nspecified number of Creation\nUnits. Similarly, shares can be\nredeemed only in Creation Units,\ngenerally for a designated\nportfolio of securities, assets\nor other positions (a \u201c\nredemption basket \u201d ) held by the\nFund and an amount of cash\n(including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be\nsubstituted). The Fund may, in\ncertain circumstances, offer\nCreation Units partially or\nsolely for cash. Except when\naggregated in Creation Units,\nshares are not redeemable by the\nFund. Creation and redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Fund\nmay accept \u201c custom baskets. \u201d\nMore information regarding custom\nbaskets is contained in the\nFund's SAI. The prices at which\ncreations and redemptions occur\nare based on the next calculation\nof NAV after a creation or\nredemption order is received in\nan acceptable form under the\nauthorized participant agreement.\nOnly an Authorized Participant\nmay create or redeem Creation\nUnits with the Fund. Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem\nCreation Units for their own\naccounts or for customers,\nincluding, without limitation,\naffiliates of the Fund. In the\nevent of a system failure or\nother interruption, including\ndisruptions at market makers or\nAuthorized Participants, orders\nto purchase or redeem Creation\nUnits either may not be executed\naccording to the Fund's\ninstructions or may not be\nexecuted at all, or the Fund may\nnot be able to place or change\norders. To the extent the Fund\nengages in in-kind transactions,\nthe Fund intends to comply with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws\nin accepting securities for\ndeposit and satisfying\nredemptions with redemption\nsecurities by, among other means,\nassuring that any securities\naccepted for deposit and any\nsecurities used to satisfy\nredemption requests will be sold\nin transactions that would be\nexempt from registration under\nthe Securities Act of 1933, as\namended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ).\nFurther, an Authorized\nParticipant that is not a \u201c\nqualified institutional buyer, \u201d\nas such term is defined in Rule\n144A under the 1933 Act, will not\nbe able to receive restricted\nsecurities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. Creations and\nredemptions must be made through\na firm that is either a member of\nthe Continuous Net Settlement\nSystem of the National Securities\nClearing Corporation or a DTC\nparticipant that has executed an\nagreement with the Distributor\nwith respect to creations and\nredemptions of Creation Unit\naggregations. Information about\nthe procedures regarding creation\nand redemption of Creation Units\n(including the cut-off times for\nreceipt of creation and\nredemption orders) is included in\nthe Fund's SAI. Because new\nshares may be created and issued\non an ongoing basis, at any point\nduring the life of the Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is\nused in the 1933 Act, may 31 be\noccurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that\nsome activities on their part\nmay, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their\nbeing deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that\ncould render them statutory\nunderwriters subject to the\nprospectus delivery and liability\nprovisions of the 1933 Act. Any\ndetermination of whether one is\nan underwriter must take into\naccount all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each\nparticular case. Broker-dealers\nshould also note that dealers who\nare not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution\n(as contrasted to ordinary\nsecondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part\nof an \u201c unsold allotment \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C)\nof the 1933 Act, would be unable\nto take advantage of the\nprospectus delivery exemption\nprovided by Section 4(a)(3) of\nthe 1933 Act. For delivery of\nprospectuses to exchange members,\nthe prospectus delivery mechanism\nof Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is\navailable only with respect to\ntransactions on a national\nsecurities exchange.\nHouseholding. Householding is an\noption available to certain Fund\ninvestors. Householding is a\nmethod of delivery, based on the\npreference of the individual\ninvestor, in which a single copy\nof certain shareholder documents\ncan be delivered to investors who\nshare the same address, even if\ntheir accounts are registered\nunder different names. Please\ncontact your broker-dealer if you\nare interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a\nsingle copy of prospectuses and\nother shareholder documents, or\nif you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change\nyour householding status. 32\nDistribution The Distributor or\nits agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the Fund on an agency\nbasis. The Distributor does not\nmaintain a secondary market in\nshares of the Fund. The\nDistributor has no role in\ndetermining the policies of the\nFund or the securities that are\npurchased or sold by the Fund.\nThe Distributor\u2019s principal\naddress is 50 Hudson Yards, New\nYork, NY 10001. BFA or its\naffiliates make payments to\nbroker-dealers, registered\ninvestment advisers, banks or\nother intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to\nmarketing activities and\npresentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems,\ndata provision services, or their\nmaking shares of the Fund and\ncertain other iShares funds\navailable to their customers\ngenerally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such\npayments, which may be\nsignificant to the intermediary,\nare not made by the Fund. Rather,\nsuch payments are made by BFA or\nits affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or\nindirectly in part from fees paid\nby the iShares funds complex.\nPayments of this type are\nsometimes referred to as revenue-\nsharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it\nrecommends or makes available, or\nthe level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the\npayments or other financial\nincentives it is eligible to\nreceive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives\noffered or made to an\nintermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary\nand its customers and may cause\nthe intermediary to recommend the\nFund or other iShares funds over\nanother investment. More\ninformation regarding these\npayments is contained in the\nFund's SAI. Please contact your\nsalesperson or other investment\nprofessional for more information\nregarding any such payments his\nor her firm may receive from BFA\nor its affiliates. 33\n\nFinancial Highlights The\nfinancial highlights table is\nintended to help investors\nunderstand the Fund\u2019s financial\nperformance for the past five\nyears. Certain information\nreflects financial results for a\nsingle share of the Fund. The\ntotal returns in the table\nrepresent the rate that an\ninvestor would have earned (or\nlost) on an investment in the\nFund, assuming reinvestment of\nall dividends and distributions.\nThis

The Listing Exchange\nmay, but is not required to, remove the shares\nof a Fund from listing if, among other things:\n(i) following the initial 12-month period\nbeginning upon the commencement of trading of\nFund shares, there are fewer than 50 record\nand/or beneficial owners of shares of a Fund;\n(ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to operate\nin reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the Investment\nCompany Act; (iii) any of the other listing\nrequirements are not continuously maintained;\nor (iv) any event shall occur or condition\nshall exist that, in the opinion of the\nListing Exchange, makes further dealings on\nthe Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing\nExchange will also remove shares of a Fund\nfrom listing and trading upon termination of\nthe Fund. As in the case of other publicly-\ntraded securities, when you buy or sell shares\nof a Fund through a broker, you may incur a\nbrokerage commission determined by that\nbroker, as well as other charges. The Trust\nreserves the right to adjust the share price\nof the Funds in the future to maintain\nconvenient trading ranges for investors. Any\nadjustments would be accomplished through\nstock splits or reverse stock splits, which\nwould have no effect on the net assets of the\nFunds or an investor's equity interest in the\nFunds. Investment Strategies and Risks Each\nFund seeks to achieve its objective by\ninvesting primarily in securities issued by\nissuers that compose its relevant Underlying\nIndex and in investments that provide\nsubstantially similar exposure to securities\nin the Underlying Index. Each Fund operates as\nan index fund and is not actively managed.\nAdverse performance of a security in a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio will ordinarily not result in the\nelimination of the security from the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Each Fund engages in representative\nsampling, which is investing in a sample of\nsecurities selected by BFA to have a\ncollective investment profile similar to that\nof the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities\nselected have aggregate investment\ncharacteristics (based on market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability, earnings valuation and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to those of the\nFund\u2019s Underlying Index. A fund that uses\nrepresentative sampling generally does not\nhold all of the securities that are in its\nunderlying index. Although the Funds do not\nseek leveraged returns, certain instruments\nused by the Funds may have a leveraging effect\nas described below. Borrowing. Each Fund may\nborrow for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The iShares\nMSCI Denmark ETF, iShares MSCI Finland ETF,\niShares MSCI Indonesia ETF, iShares MSCI\nIreland ETF, iShares MSCI Japan Value ETF,\niShares MSCI New Zealand\n\n2\n\nETF, iShares MSCI Norway ETF, iShares MSCI\nPhilippines ETF, iShares MSCI Poland ETF,\niShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF and iShares\nMSCI United Kingdom Small-Cap ETF, along with\ncertain other iShares funds, have entered into\na syndicated line of credit with the Bank of\nNew York Mellon ( \u201c BNY \u201d ), which serves as\nadministrative agent for itself and the other\nbanks. The syndicated line of credit may be\nused for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding redemption, settlement of trades and\nrebalancing of portfolio holdings. Interest\nrates related to the syndicated line of credit\nare based on the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ) published by the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York plus a spread.\nPursuant to the terms of the credit agreement,\nif SOFR were to cease being published or\nrepresentative, it would be replaced by a rate\nbased on an alternate benchmark selected by\nBNY. The purchase of securities while\nborrowings are outstanding may have the effect\nof leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of\nleverage increases a Fund\u2019s exposure to risk,\nand borrowed funds are subject to interest\ncosts that will reduce net income. Purchasing\nsecurities while borrowings are outstanding\ncreates special risks, such as the potential\nfor greater volatility in the NAV of Fund\nshares and in the yield on a Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nIn addition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\na Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the amount\navailable (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\na Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank\nor may result in a Fund being subject to\ncovenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire a Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Currency\nTransactions. A currency forward contract is\nan over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) obligation to\npurchase or sell a specific currency at a\nfuture date, which may be any fixed number of\ndays greater than two days from the date on\nwhich the contract is agreed upon by the\nparties, at a price set at the time of the\ncontract. A non-deliverable currency forward\nis an OTC currency forward settled in a\nspecified currency, on a specified date, based\non the difference between the agreed-upon\nexchange rate and the market exchange rate. A\ncurrency futures contract is a contract that\ntrades on an organized futures exchange\ninvolving an obligation to deliver or acquire\na specified amount of a specific currency, at\na specified price and at a specified future\ntime. Currency futures contracts may be\nsettled on a net cash payment basis rather\nthan by the sale and delivery of the\nunderlying currency. The Funds do not expect\nto engage in currency transactions for the\npurpose of hedging against declines in the\nvalue of each Fund's assets that are\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may\nenter into non-U.S. currency forward and\nnon-U.S. currency futures transactions to\nfacilitate local securities settlements or to\nprotect against currency exposure in\nconnection with its distributions to\nshareholders, but may not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes. Foreign\nexchange transactions involve a significant\ndegree of risk and the markets in which\nforeign exchange transactions are effected may\nbe highly volatile, highly specialized and\nhighly technical. Significant changes,\nincluding changes in liquidity and prices, can\noccur in such markets within very short\nperiods of time, often within minutes. Foreign\nexchange trading risks include, but are not\nlimited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty\nrisk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and\npotential interference by foreign governments\nthrough regulation of local exchange markets,\nforeign investment or particular transactions\nin non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the correlation of a\nFund's return with the performance of its\nUnderlying Index and may lower the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. A Fund could experience losses if the\nvalue of its currency forwards, options or\nfutures positions were poorly correlated with\nits other investments or if it could not close\nout its positions because of an illiquid\nmarket or otherwise. In addition, a Fund could\nincur transaction costs, including trading\ncommissions, in connection with certain\nnon-U.S. currency transactions.\nDiversification Status. The following table\nsets forth the diversification status of each\nFund:\n                                              \n  Diversified Funds     Non-Diversified       \n                        Funds                 \n                        iShares Climate       \n  iShares ESG Advanced  Conscious &           \n  MSCI EAFE ETF         Transition MSCI USA   \n                        ETF                   \n  iShares ESG Aware     iShares Emergent      \n  MSCI EAFE ETF         Food and AgTech       \n                        Multisector ETF       \n                                              \n3\n                                              \n  Diversified Funds    Non-Diversified Funds  \n  iShares ESG Aware    iShares ESG Advanced   \n  MSCI USA ETF         MSCI USA ETF           \n  iShares ESG Aware    iShares ESG Aware      \n  MSCI USA Small-Cap   MSCI USA Growth ETF    \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI Japan   iShares ESG Aware      \n  Value ETF            MSCI USA Value ETF     \n  iShares MSCI United  iShares ESG MSCI USA   \n  Kingdom Small-Cap    Leaders ETF            \n  ETF                                         \n                       iShares MSCI Denmark   \n                       ETF                    \n                       iShares MSCI Finland   \n                       ETF                    \n                       iShares MSCI           \n                       Indonesia ETF          \n                       iShares MSCI Ireland   \n                       ETF                    \n                       iShares MSCI New       \n                       Zealand ETF            \n                       iShares MSCI Norway    \n                       ETF                    \n                       iShares MSCI           \n                       Philippines ETF        \n                       iShares MSCI Poland    \n                       ETF                    \n                       iShares MSCI United    \n                       Kingdom ETF            \n                       iShares Paris-Aligned  \n                       Climate MSCI USA ETF   \n                                              \nA fund classified as \u201c diversified \u201d under the\n1940 Act may not purchase securities of an\nissuer (other than (i) obligations issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities and (ii)\nsecurities of other investment companies) if,\nwith respect to 75% of its total assets, (a)\nmore than 5% of the fund\u2019s total assets would\nbe invested in securities of that issuer or\n(b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of that issuer.\nWith respect to the remaining 25% of its total\nassets, the fund may invest more than 5% of\nits assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act,\na fund cannot change its classification from\ndiversified to non-diversified without\nshareholder approval. A \u201c non-diversified \u201d\nfund is a fund that is not limited by the 1940\nAct with regard to the percentage of its\nassets that may be invested in the securities\nof a single issuer. The securities of a\nparticular issuer (or securities of issuers in\nparticular industries) may constitute a\nsignificant percentage of the underlying index\nof such a fund and, consequently, the fund\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio. This may adversely\naffect a fund\u2019s performance or subject the\nfund\u2019s shares to greater price volatility than\nthat experienced by more diversified\ninvestment companies. Each Fund (whether\ndiversified or non-diversified) intends to\nmaintain the required level of diversification\nand otherwise conduct its operations so as to\nqualify as a regulated investment company ( \u201c\nRIC \u201d ) for purposes of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c\nInternal Revenue Code \u201d ), and to relieve the\nFund of any liability for U.S. federal income\ntax to the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to shareholders, provided that the\nFund satisfies a minimum distribution\nrequirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Funds and may make it less\nlikely that the Funds will meet their\nrespective investment objectives. Futures,\nOptions on Futures and Securities Options.\nFutures contracts, options on futures and\nsecurities options may be used by a Fund to\nsimulate investment in its Underlying Index,\nto facilitate trading or to reduce transaction\ncosts. Each Fund may enter into futures\ncontracts and options on futures that are\ntraded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange.\nEach Fund will not use futures, options on\nfutures or securities options for speculative\npurposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and\noptions on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5\nof the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under the\nCommodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA, with\nrespect to certain Funds, has claimed an\nexclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d in accordance with\nRule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such\nFunds, is not subject to registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under\nthe CEA. See the Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives section of this SAI for more\ninformation. Futures contracts provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. Each\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, a Fund will\nbe required to deposit with the\n\n4\n\nbroker an amount of cash or cash equivalents\nknown as \u201c initial margin, \u201d which is similar\nto a performance bond or good faith deposit on\nthe contract and is returned to the Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, each Fund may elect to close the\nposition by taking an opposite position, which\nwill operate to terminate the Fund\u2019s existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof each Fund. The potential for loss related\nto writing call options is unlimited. The\npotential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. Certain of the Funds may purchase and\nwrite put and call options on futures\ncontracts that are traded on an exchange as a\nhedge against changes in value of their\nportfolio securities or in anticipation of the\npurchase of securities, and may enter into\nclosing transactions with respect to such\noptions to terminate existing positions. There\nis no guarantee that such closing transactions\ncan be effected. Securities options may be\nused by a Fund to obtain access to securities\nin its Underlying Index or to dispose of\nsecurities in its Underlying Index at\nfavorable prices, to invest cash in a\nsecurities index that offers similar exposure\nto that provided by its Underlying Index or\notherwise to achieve the Fund\u2019s objective of\ntracking its Underlying Index. A call option\ngives a holder the right to purchase a\nspecific security at a specified price ( \u201c\nexercise price \u201d ) within a specified period\nof time. A put option gives a holder the right\nto sell a specific security at an exercise\nprice within a specified period of time. The\ninitial purchaser of a call option pays the \u201c\nwriter \u201d a premium, which is paid at the time\nof purchase and is retained by the writer\nwhether or not such option is exercised. Each\nFund may purchase put options to hedge its\nportfolio against the risk of a decline in the\nmarket value of securities held and may\npurchase call options to hedge against an\nincrease in the price of securities it is\ncommitted to purchase. Each Fund may write put\nand call options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell\nsecurities options on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nsecurities exchange or in the OTC market\nthrough a transaction with a dealer. Options\non a securities index are typically settled on\na net basis based on the appreciation or\ndepreciation of the index level over the\nstrike price. Options on single name\nsecurities may be cash- or physically-settled,\ndepending upon the market in which they are\ntraded. Options may be structured so as to be\nexercisable only on certain dates or on a\ndaily basis. Options may also be structured to\nhave conditions to exercise ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-\nin Events \u201d ) or conditions that trigger\ntermination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out Events \u201d ).\nLending Portfolio Securities. Each Fund may\nlend portfolio securities to certain borrowers\nthat BFA determines to be creditworthy,\nincluding borrowers affiliated with BFA. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is\nmaintained in an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent market value of the securities loaned.\nNo securities loan shall be made on behalf of\na Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of\nall securities loans of the particular Fund\nexceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's\ntotal assets (including the value of the\ncollateral received). A Fund may terminate a\nloan at any time and obtain the return of the\nsecurities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way\nof substitute payment, the value of any\ninterest or cash or non-cash distributions\npaid on the loaned securities that it would\nhave otherwise received if the securities were\nnot on loan. With respect to loans that are\ncollateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount\nof cash collateral. The Funds are compensated\nby any positive difference between the amount\nearned on the reinvestment of cash collateral\nand the fee paid to the borrower. In the case\nof collateral other than cash, a Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of each Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\n\n5\n\nEach Fund conducts its securities lending\npursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC\npermitting it to lend portfolio securities to\nborrowers affiliated with the Fund and to\nretain an affiliate of the Fund to act as\nsecurities lending agent. To the extent that a\nFund engages in securities lending, BlackRock\nInstitutional Trust Company, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d )\nacts as securities lending agent for the Fund,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC\nadministers the lending program in accordance\nwith guidelines approved by the Trust's Board\nof Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the trustees of\nwhich are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ). JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d ) serves as\ncustodian for the Funds in connection with\ncertain securities lending activities.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk\n(i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If a Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Funds'\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, a Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return a Fund\u2019s securities as agreed, the\nFund\u2019s ability to participate in a corporate\naction event may be impacted, or the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. This latter event\ncould trigger adverse tax consequences for a\nFund. A Fund could lose money if its short-\nterm investment of the collateral declines in\nvalue over the period of the loan. Substitute\npayments received by a Fund representing\ndividends paid on securities loaned out by the\nFund will not be considered qualified dividend\nincome. BTC will take into account the tax\neffects on shareholders caused by this\ndifference in connection with a Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to a Fund (as permitted by\napplicable law). Regulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require certain bank-\nregulated counterparties and certain of their\naffiliates to include in certain financial\ncontracts, including many securities lending\nagreements, terms that delay or restrict the\nrights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to\nterminate such agreements, foreclose upon\ncollateral, exercise other default rights or\nrestrict transfers of credit support in the\nevent that the counterparty and/or its\naffiliates are subject to certain types of\nresolution or insolvency proceedings. It is\npossible that these requirements, as well as\npotential additional government regulation and\nother developments in the market, could\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to\nterminate existing securities lending\nagreements or to realize amounts to be\nreceived under such agreements. Liquidity Risk\nManagement. Rule 22e-4 under the Investment\nCompany Act (the \u201c Liquidity Rule \u201d ) requires\nopen-end funds, including exchange-traded\nfunds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) such as the Funds, to\nestablish a liquidity risk management program\n(the \u201c Liquidity Program \u201d ) and enhance\ndisclosures regarding fund liquidity. As\nrequired by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have\nimplemented a Liquidity Program, and the\nBoard, including a majority of the Independent\nTrustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as\nthe administrator of the Liquidity Program.\nUnder the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses,\nmanages, and periodically reviews each Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk and classifies each investment\nheld by a Fund as a \u201c highly liquid\ninvestment, \u201d \u201c moderately liquid investment,\n\u201d \u201c less liquid investment \u201d or \u201c illiquid\ninvestment. \u201d The Liquidity Rule defines \u201c\nliquidity risk \u201d as the risk that a Fund could\nnot meet requests to redeem shares issued by a\nFund without significant dilution of the\nremaining investors\u2019 interest in a Fund. The\nliquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment-specific considerations under\nthe Liquidity Program. There are exclusions\nfrom certain portions of the liquidity risk\nmanagement program requirements for \u201c in-kind\n\u201d ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To\nthe extent that an investment is deemed to be\nan illiquid investment or a less liquid\ninvestment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to\ngreater liquidity risk. Non-U.S. Securities.\nCertain Funds intend to purchase publicly\ntraded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To\nthe extent a Fund invests in stocks of\nnon-U.S. issuers, certain of the Fund's\ninvestments in such stocks may be in the form\nof American Depositary Receipts ( \u201c ADRs \u201d ),\nGlobal Depositary Receipts ( \u201c GDRs \u201d ) and\nEuropean Depositary Receipts ( \u201c EDRs \u201d )\n(collectively,\n\n6\n\n\u201c depositary receipts \u201d ). Depositary receipts\nare receipts, typically issued by a bank or\ntrust issuer, which evidence ownership of\nunderlying securities issued by a non-U.S.\nissuer. Depositary receipts may not\nnecessarily be denominated in the same\ncurrency as their underlying securities. ADRs\ntypically are issued by a U.S. bank or trust\ncompany and evidence ownership of underlying\nsecurities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. EDRs,\nwhich are sometimes referred to as continental\ndepositary receipts, are receipts issued in\nEurope, typically by foreign banks and trust\ncompanies, that evidence ownership of either\nforeign or domestic underlying securities.\nGDRs are depositary receipts structured like\nglobal debt issues to facilitate trading on an\ninternational basis. Generally, ADRs, issued\nin registered form, are designed for use in\nthe U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued\nin bearer form, are designed for use in\nEuropean securities markets. GDRs are tradable\nboth in the U.S. and in Europe and are\ndesigned for use throughout the world.\nDepositary receipts are generally subject to\nthe same risks as the foreign securities that\nthey evidence or into which they may be\nconverted. In addition to investment risks\nassociated with the underlying issuer,\ndepositary receipts expose a Fund to\nadditional risks associated with the non-\nuniform terms that apply to depositary receipt\nprograms, credit exposure to the depository\nbank and to the sponsors and other parties\nwith whom the depository bank establishes the\nprograms, currency risk and liquidity risk.\nUnsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned\nby the issuer of the underlying common stock,\ngenerally expose investors to greater risks\nthan sponsored programs and do not provide\nholders with many of the shareholder benefits\nthat come from investing in a sponsored\ndepositary receipts. Investing in the\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers involves\nspecial risks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in U.S. issuers.\nThese include differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards;\nthe possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation; adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations;\npolitical instability, which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in non-U.S. countries; and\npotential restrictions on the flow of\ninternational capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be\nsubject to less governmental regulation than\nU.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S.\neconomies may differ favorably or unfavorably\nfrom the U.S. economy in such respects as\ngrowth of gross domestic product ( \u201c GDP \u201d ),\nrate of inflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and balance of\npayment positions. Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives. The CFTC subjects advisers to\nregistered investment companies to regulation\nby the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the\nadviser either (i) invests, directly or\nindirectly, more than a prescribed level of\nits liquidation value in CFTC-regulated\nfutures, options and swaps ( \u201c CFTC\nDerivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to each of the Funds. BFA is not,\ntherefore, subject to registration or\nregulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA with respect to the Funds. The\niShares Climate Conscious & Transition MSCI\nUSA ETF, iShares Emergent Food and AgTech\nMultisector ETF, iShares ESG Advanced MSCI\nEAFE ETF, iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF,\niShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares ESG\nAware MSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA\nSmall-Cap ETF, iShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders\nETF, iShares MSCI Finland ETF, iShares MSCI\nIndonesia ETF, iShares MSCI Ireland ETF,\niShares MSCI Japan Value ETF, iShares MSCI New\nZealand ETF, iShares MSCI Philippines ETF,\niShares MSCI Poland ETF, iShares MSCI United\nKingdom ETF, iShares MSCI United Kingdom\nSmall-Cap ETF and iShares Paris-Aligned\nClimate MSCI USA ETF (the \u201c No-Action Letter\nFunds \u201d ) may also have investments in \u201c\nunderlying funds \u201d (and such underlying funds\nthemselves may invest in underlying funds) not\nadvised by BFA (the term \u201c underlying fund \u201d\nfor purposes of the no-action letter\nreferenced below may include, but is not\nlimited to, certain securitized vehicles,\nmortgage or international real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ), business\ndevelopment companies and investment companies\nthat may invest in CFTC Derivatives or in any\nof the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed\nby the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA may not\nhave transparency into the holdings of these\nunderlying funds because they are not advised\nby BFA. To address this issue of lack of\ntransparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-\naction letter on November 29, 2012 permitting\nthe adviser of a fund that invests in such\nunderlying funds and that would otherwise have\nfiled a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC\nRule 4.5 to delay registration as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d until six months\nfrom the date on which the CFTC issues\nadditional guidance on the treatment of CFTC\nDerivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the\nadviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has\nfiled a claim with the CFTC for such funds to\nrely on this no-action relief. Accordingly,\nBFA is not currently subject to registration\nor regulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA in respect of such funds.\n\n7\n\nDerivative contracts, including, without\nlimitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-\ndeliverable forwards, are subject to\nregulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act ( \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under comparable\nregimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.\njurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards\nand certain other derivatives traded in the\nOTC market are subject to variation margin and\ninitial margin requirements. Implementation of\nthe margining and other provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory\ntrading, reporting and documentation of swaps\nand other derivatives have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact the costs to a Fund of\ntrading these instruments and, as a result,\nmay affect returns to investors in such Fund.\nRule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act\npermits a Fund to enter into Derivatives\nTransactions (as defined below) and certain\nother transactions notwithstanding the\nrestrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior\nsecurities \u201d under Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act. Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act, among other things,\nprohibits open-end funds, including the Funds,\nfrom issuing or selling any \u201c senior security,\n\u201d other than borrowing from a bank (subject to\na requirement to maintain 300% \u201c asset\ncoverage \u201d ). Under Rule 18f-4, \u201c Derivatives\nTransactions \u201d include the following: (1) any\nswap, security-based swap (including a\ncontract for differences), futures contract,\nforward contract, option (excluding purchased\noptions), any combination of the foregoing, or\nany similar instrument, under which a Fund is\nor may be required to make any payment or\ndelivery of cash or other assets during the\nlife of the instrument or at maturity or early\ntermination, whether as margin or settlement\npayment or otherwise; (2) any short sale\nborrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions (e.g.,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nand borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat\nthese transactions as Derivatives Transactions\nunder Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or\nforward-settling securities (e.g., firm and\nstandby commitments, including to-be-announced\n( \u201c TBA \u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and\nnon-standard settlement cycle securities,\nunless the Fund intends to physically settle\nthe transaction and the transaction will\nsettle within 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\nUnless a Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to\nadopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if a Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Repurchase\nAgreements. A repurchase agreement is an\ninstrument under which the purchaser ( i.e. ,\na Fund) acquires a security and the seller\nagrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase\nthe security at a mutually agreed-upon time\nand price, thereby determining the yield\nduring the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by a Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Fund may suffer\ntime delays and incur costs or losses in\nconnection with the disposition of the\ncollateral. In any repurchase transaction, the\ncollateral for a repurchase agreement may\ninclude: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations\nissued by the U.S. government or its agencies\nor instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations\nthat, at the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for a\nFund that utilizes them. Such risks are not\nunique to the Funds, but are inherent in\nrepurchase agreements. The Funds seek to\nminimize such risks, but because of the\ninherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s\n\n8\n\nrepurchase obligation, a Fund would likely\nretain the status of an unsecured creditor of\nthe counterparty ( i.e. , the position a Fund\nwould normally be in if it were to hold,\npursuant to its investment policies, other\nunsecured debt securities of the defaulting\ncounterparty) with respect to the amount of\nthe shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a\nFund would be at risk of losing some or all of\nthe principal and income involved in the\ntransaction. Reverse Repurchase Agreements.\nReverse repurchase agreements involve the sale\nof securities with an agreement to repurchase\nthe securities at an agreed-upon price, date\nand interest payment and have the\ncharacteristics of borrowing. Generally, the\neffect of such transactions is that a Fund can\nrecover all or most of the cash invested in\nthe portfolio securities involved during the\nterm of the reverse repurchase agreement,\nwhile in many cases the Fund is able to keep\nsome of the interest income associated with\nthose securities. Such transactions are\nadvantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity\nto earn a rate of interest on the cash derived\nfrom these transactions that is greater than\nthe interest cost of obtaining the same amount\nof cash. Opportunities to realize earnings\nfrom the use of the proceeds equal to or\ngreater than the interest required to be paid\nmay not always be available, and a Fund\nintends to use the reverse repurchase\ntechnique only when BFA believes it will be\nadvantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse\nrepurchase agreements may exaggerate any\nincrease or decrease in the value of a Fund\u2019s\nassets. The use of reverse repurchase\nagreements is a form of leverage, and the\nproceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse\nrepurchase agreements may be invested in\nadditional securities. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits a Fund to enter\ninto reverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions ( e.g., recourse and\nnon-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed\nbonds) notwithstanding the limitation on the\nissuance of senior securities in Section 18 of\nthe Investment Company Act, provided that a\nFund either (i) complies with the 300% asset\ncoverage ratio with respect to such\ntransactions and any other borrowings in the\naggregate, or (ii) treats such transactions as\nDerivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4.\n(See \u201c Regulation Regarding Derivatives \u201d\nabove.) Securities of Investment Companies.\nEach Fund may invest in the securities of\nother investment companies (including money\nmarket funds) to the extent permitted by law.\nPursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund\u2019s investment\nin registered investment companies is\ngenerally limited to, subject to certain\nexceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of any one investment company;\n(ii) 5% of a Fund\u2019s total assets with respect\nto any one investment company; and (iii) 10%\nof a Fund\u2019s total assets with respect to\ninvestment companies in the aggregate. Other\ninvestment companies in which a Fund may\ninvest can be expected to incur fees and\nexpenses for operations, such as investment\nadvisory and administration fees, which would\nbe in addition to those incurred by the Fund.\nPursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff,\nfees and expenses of money market funds used\nfor cash collateral received in connection\nwith loans of securities are not treated as\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect\na Fund\u2019s pro rata share of the fees and\nexpenses incurred by investing in other\ninvestment companies (as disclosed in the\nProspectus, as applicable). Short-Term\nInstruments and Temporary Investments. Each\nFund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, on an\nongoing basis to provide liquidity or for\nother reasons. Money market instruments are\ngenerally short-term investments that may\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) shares of\nmoney market funds (including those advised by\nBFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit,\nbankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed-time deposits and\nother obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks\n(including non-U.S. branches) and similar\ninstitutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at\nthe date of purchase, \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by Moody's \u00ae\nInvestors Service, Inc., \u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch\nRatings, Inc., or \u201c A-1 \u201d by Standard & Poor's\n\u00ae Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P\nGlobal, Inc., or if unrated, of comparable\nquality as determined by BFA; (v) non-\nconvertible corporate debt securities ( e.g. ,\nbonds and debentures) with remaining\nmaturities at the date of purchase of not more\nthan 397 days and that have been determined to\npresent minimal credit risks, in accordance\nwith the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7\nunder the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase\nagreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-\ndenominated obligations of non-U.S. banks\n(including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion\nof BFA, are of comparable quality to\nobligations of U.S. banks that may be\npurchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments\nmay be purchased on a current or forward-\nsettled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions. Swap Agreements.\nSwap agreements are contracts between parties\nin which one party agrees to make periodic\npayments to the other party based on a pre-\ndetermined underlying investment or notional\namount. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the first party\nbased on the return (or a differential in rate\nof return) earned or realized on the\n\n9\n\nunderlying investment or notional amount. Swap\nagreements will usually be performed on a net\nbasis, with a Fund receiving or paying only\nthe net amount of the two payments. The net\namount of the excess, if any, of a Fund\u2019s\nobligations over its entitlements with respect\nto each swap is accrued on a daily basis. The\nFunds may enter into swap agreements,\nincluding currency swaps, interest rate swaps\nand index swaps, or for the iShares Paris-\nAligned Climate MSCI USA ETF, total return\nswaps (some of which may be referred to as\ncontracts for difference or \u201c CFDs \u201d ). The\nuse of swaps is a highly specialized activity\nthat involves investment techniques and risks\ndifferent from those associated with ordinary\nportfolio security transactions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets. Tracking Stocks. A tracking stock is a\nseparate class of common stock whose value is\nlinked to a specific business unit or\noperating division within a larger company and\nis designed to \u201c track \u201d the performance of\nsuch business unit or division. The tracking\nstock may pay dividends to shareholders\nindependent of the parent company. The parent\ncompany, rather than the business unit or\ndivision, generally is the issuer of tracking\nstock. However, holders of the tracking stock\nmay not have the same rights as holders of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock. Future Developments.\nThe Board may, in the future, authorize each\nFund to invest in securities contracts and\ninvestments, other than those listed in this\nSAI and in the applicable Prospectuses,\nprovided they are consistent with each Fund's\ninvestment objective and do not violate any of\nits investment restrictions or policies.\nGeneral Considerations and Risks A discussion\nof some of the principal risks associated with\nan investment in a Fund is contained in the\napplicable Prospectus. An investment in a Fund\nshould be made with an understanding that the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of stocks in\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce a Fund\u2019s return.\nBorrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to\ndo so to satisfy its obligations. Commodities\nInvestment Risk. Exposure to commodities\nmarkets may subject a Fund to greater\nvolatility than investments in traditional\nsecurities. The commodities markets have\nexperienced periods of extreme volatility.\nSimilar future market conditions may result in\nrapid and substantial valuation increases or\ndecreases in a Fund\u2019s holdings. The\ncommodities markets may fluctuate widely based\non a variety of factors. Movements in\ncommodity investment prices are outside of a\nFund's control and may not be anticipated by\nBFA. Price movements may be influenced by,\namong other things: governmental,\nagricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary and\nexchange control programs and policies;\nchanging market and economic conditions;\nmarket liquidity; weather and climate\nconditions, including droughts and floods;\nlivestock disease; changing supply and demand\nrelationships and levels of domestic\nproduction and imported commodities; changes\nin storage costs; the availability of local,\nintrastate and interstate transportation\nsystems; energy conservation; the success of\nexploration projects; changes in international\nbalances of payments and trade; domestic and\nforeign rates of inflation; currency\ndevaluations and revaluations; domestic and\nforeign political and economic events;\ndomestic and foreign interest rates and/or\ninvestor expectations concerning interest\nrates; foreign currency/exchange rates;\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation\nand taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other\npolitical upheaval and conflicts; governmental\nexpropriation; investment and trading\nactivities of mutual funds, hedge funds and\ncommodities funds; and changes in philosophies\nand emotions of market participants. The\nfrequency and magnitude of such changes cannot\nbe predicted. The prices of commodities can\nalso fluctuate widely due to supply and demand\ndisruptions in major producing or consuming\nregions. Certain commodities or natural\nresources may be produced in a limited number\nof countries and may be controlled by a small\nnumber of producers or groups of producers. As\na result, political, economic, regulatory and\nsupply-related events in such countries could\nhave a disproportionate impact on the prices\nof such commodities.\n\n10\n\nA decrease in the production of a physical\ncommodity or a decrease in the volume of such\ncommodity available for transportation,\nmining, processing, storage or distribution\nmay adversely impact the financial performance\nof a commodity or commodity-related company\nthat devotes a portion of its business to that\ncommodity. Production declines and volume\ndecreases could be caused by various factors,\nincluding catastrophic events affecting\nproduction, depletion of resources, labor\ndifficulties, environmental proceedings,\nincreased regulations, equipment failures and\nunexpected maintenance problems, import supply\ndisruption, governmental expropriation,\npolitical upheaval or conflicts or increased\ncompetition from alternative energy sources or\ncommodity prices. Agricultural commodities may\nbe adversely affected by weather or other\nnatural phenomena, such as drought, floods and\npests. A sustained decline in demand for such\ncommodities could also adversely affect the\nfinancial performance of commodity-related\ncompanies. Factors that could lead to a\ndecline in demand include economic recession\nor other adverse economic conditions, higher\ntaxes on commodities or increased governmental\nregulations, increases in fuel economy,\nconsumer shifts to the use of alternative\ncommodities or fuel sources, changes in\ncommodity prices, or weather. The commodity\nmarkets are subject to temporary distortions\nand other disruptions due to, among other\nfactors, lack of liquidity, the participation\nof speculators, and government regulation and\nother actions. U.S. futures exchanges and some\nforeign exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation in futures contract prices which\nmay occur in a single business day (generally\nreferred to as \u201c daily price fluctuation\nlimits \u201d ). The maximum or minimum price of a\ncontract as a result of these limits is\nreferred to as a \u201c limit price. \u201d If the limit\nprice has been reached in a particular\ncontract, no trades may be made beyond the\nlimit price. Limit prices have the effect of\nprecluding trading in a particular contract or\nforcing the liquidation of contracts at\ndisadvantageous times or prices. Currency\nRisk. Because each Fund's NAV is determined on\nthe basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may\nlose money if the currency of a non-U.S.\nmarket in which a Fund invests depreciates\nagainst the U.S. dollar, even if the local\ncurrency value of a Fund\u2019s holdings in that\nmarket increases. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency loses value because the currency is\nworth fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, when the\nU.S. dollar decreases in value against a\nforeign currency, a security denominated in\nthat currency gains value because the currency\nis worth more U.S. dollars. This risk,\ngenerally known as \u201c currency risk, \u201d means\nthat a strong U.S. dollar will reduce returns\nfor U.S. investors, while a weak U.S. dollar\nwill increase those returns. Foreign exchange\ntransactions involve a significant degree of\nrisk and the markets in which foreign exchange\ntransactions are effected are highly volatile,\nhighly specialized and highly technical.\nSignificant changes, including changes in\nliquidity and prices, can occur in such\nmarkets within very short periods of time,\noften within minutes. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the Fund\u2019s performance\nand may lower a Fund\u2019s return. A Fund could\nexperience losses if the value of its currency\nforward positions are poorly correlated with\nits other investments or if it cannot close\nout its positions because of an illiquid\nmarket. In addition, a Fund could incur\ntransaction costs, including trading\ncommissions, in connection with certain\nnon-U.S. currency transactions. Custody Risk.\nCustody risk refers to the risks inherent in\nthe process of clearing and settling trades\nand to the holding of securities, cash and\nother assets by local banks, agents and\ndepositories. Low trading volumes and volatile\nprices in less developed markets make trades\nharder to complete and settle, and governments\nor trade groups may compel local agents to\nhold securities in designated depositories\nthat may not be subject to independent\nevaluation. Local agents are held only to the\nstandards of care of their local markets, and\nthus may be subject to limited or no\ngovernment oversight. Communications between\nthe U.S. and emerging market countries may be\nunreliable, increasing the risk of delayed\nsettlements or losses of security\ncertificates. In general, the less developed a\ncountry\u2019s securities market is, the greater\nthe likelihood of custody problems. Practices\nin relation to the settlement of securities\ntransactions in emerging markets involve\nhigher risks than those in developed markets,\nin part because of the use of brokers and\ncounterparties that are often less well\ncapitalized, and custody and registration of\nassets in some countries may be unreliable.\nThe possibility of fraud, negligence or undue\ninfluence being exerted by the issuer or\nrefusal to recognize ownership exists in some\nemerging markets, and, along with other\nfactors, could result in ownership\nregistration being lost. In addition, the laws\nof certain countries may put limits on a\nFund\u2019s ability to recover its assets if a\nforeign bank or depository or issuer of a\nsecurity or an agent of any of the foregoing\ngoes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss\nresulting from such custody problems and may\nhave no successful claim for compensation.\n\n11\n\nDividend-Paying Stock Risk. Investing in\ndividend-paying stocks involves the risk that\nsuch stocks may fall out of favor with\ninvestors and underperform the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of the stocks held by a Fund will not\ndeclare dividends in the future or will reduce\nor eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends) in the future. Illiquid Investments\nRisk. Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that a Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without significantly changing the market\nvalue of the investment. The liquidity of an\ninvestment will be determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment\nspecific considerations as set out in the\nLiquidity Program as required by the Liquidity\nRule. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Money Market\nInstruments Risk. A Fund may hold money market\ninstruments. The value of money market\ninstruments may be affected by changes in\ninterest rates or in the credit ratings of the\ninvestments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of a Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. It is possible to\nlose money by investing in a money market\nfund. Money market funds other than U.S.\ngovernment money market funds and retail money\nmarket funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV instead of\nusing a stable $1.00 per share price.\nOperational Risk. BFA and a Fund's other\nservice providers may experience disruptions\nor operating errors such as processing errors\nor human errors, inadequate or failed internal\nor external processes, or systems or\ntechnology failures, that could negatively\nimpact the Funds. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from a Fund\u2019s in the setting of\npriorities, the personnel and resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. BFA, through its monitoring and\noversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect a\nFund or to develop processes and controls to\ncompletely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Reference Rate\nReplacement Risk. A Fund may be exposed to\nfinancial instruments that recently\ntransitioned from, or continue to be tied to,\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate ( \u201c LIBOR \u201d\n) to determine payment obligations, financing\nterms, hedging strategies or investment value.\nThe FCA , which regulates LIBOR, has ceased\npublishing all LIBOR settings. In April 2023,\nhowever, the FCA announced that some USD LIBOR\nsettings will continue to be published under a\nsynthetic methodology until September 30, 2024\nfor certain legacy contracts. The Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which\nis a broad measure of the cost of borrowing\ncash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities in the repurchase agreement market,\nhas been used increasingly on a voluntary\nbasis in new instruments and transactions.\nUnder U.S. regulations that implement a\nstatutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR,\nbenchmark rates based on SOFR have replaced\nLIBOR in different categories of financial\ncontracts. Neither the effect of the LIBOR\ntransition process nor its ultimate success\ncan yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-\nbased instruments may contemplate a scenario\nwhere LIBOR is no longer available by\nproviding for an alternative rate-setting\nmethodology, there may be significant\nuncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any\nsuch alternative methodologies to replicate\nLIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may have alternative rate-setting\nprovisions and there remains uncertainty\nregarding the willingness and ability of\nissuers to add alternative rate-setting\nprovisions in certain existing instruments.\nParties to contracts, securities, or other\ninstruments using LIBOR may disagree on\ntransition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. A Fund may have\ninstruments linked to other interbank offered\nrates that may also cease to be published in\nthe future. Risk of Derivatives. A derivative\nis a financial contract, the value of which\ndepends on, or is derived from, the value of\nan underlying asset, such as a security, a\ncommodity (such as gold or silver), a currency\nor an index (a measure of value or rates, such\nas the S&P 500 \u00ae or the prime lending rate). A\nFund may invest in futures contracts,\nsecurities options, CFDs (for the iShares\nParis-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF) and other\nderivatives. Compared to securities,\nderivatives can be more sensitive\n\n12\n\nto changes in interest rates or to sudden\nfluctuations in market prices and thus a\nFund\u2019s losses may be greater if it invests in\nderivatives than if it invests only in\nconventional securities. Derivatives are also\nsubject to counterparty risk, which is the\nrisk that the other party in the transaction\nwill not fulfill its contractual obligations.\nDerivatives generally involve the incurrence\nof leverage. When a derivative is used as a\nhedge against a position that a Fund holds or\nis committed to purchase, any loss generated\nby the derivative generally should be\nsubstantially offset by gains on the hedged\ninvestment, and vice versa. While hedging can\nreduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce\nor eliminate gains and, in some cases, hedging\ncan cause losses that are not offset by gains,\nand a Fund will recognize losses on both the\ninvestment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes\nsubject to imperfect matching between the\nderivative and the underlying security, and\nthere can be no assurance that a Fund's\nhedging transactions, which entail additional\ntransaction costs, will be effective. Risk of\nEquity Securities. An investment in a Fund\nshould be made with an understanding of the\nrisks inherent in an investment in equity\nsecurities, including the risk that the\nfinancial condition of issuers may become\nimpaired or that the general condition of\nstock markets may deteriorate (either of which\nmay cause a decrease in the value of the\nportfolio securities and thus in the value of\nshares of the Fund). Common stocks are\nsusceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations and to increases and decreases in\nvalue as market confidence and perceptions of\ntheir issuers change. These investor\nperceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors, including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Common stocks may experience extreme\nprice volatility due to actions taken by\nparticular investors or groups of investors\n(for example, retail investors influenced by\nsocial media activity or other media coverage\nor significant \u201c short \u201d positions taken by\ninstitutional investors). Holders of common\nstocks incur more risks than holders of\npreferred stocks and debt obligations because\ncommon stockholders generally have rights to\nreceive payments from stock issuers that are\ninferior to the rights of creditors, or\nholders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (the value of which,\nhowever, is subject to market fluctuations\nprior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stocks have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity date. In addition, issuers may, in\ntimes of distress or at their own discretion,\ndecide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which\nmay also cause their stock price to decline.\nAlthough most of the securities in each\nUnderlying Index are listed on a securities\nexchange, the principal trading market for\nsome of the securities may be in the OTC\nmarket. The existence of a liquid trading\nmarket for certain securities may depend on\nwhether dealers will make a market in such\nsecurities. There can be no assurance that a\nmarket will be made or maintained or that any\nsuch market will be or remain liquid. The\nprice at which securities may be sold and the\nvalue of a Fund\u2019s shares will be adversely\naffected if trading markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities are limited or absent, or\nif bid/ask spreads are wide. Risk of Futures\nand Options on Futures Transactions. There are\nseveral risks accompanying the utilization of\nfutures contracts and options on futures\ncontracts. A position in futures contracts and\noptions on futures contracts may be closed\nonly on the exchange on which the contract was\nmade (or a linked exchange). While each Fund\nplans to utilize futures contracts only if an\nactive market exists for such contracts, there\nis no guarantee that a liquid market will\nexist for the contract at a specified time.\nFutures contracts, by definition, project\nprice levels in the future and not current\nlevels of valuation; therefore, market\ncircumstances may result in a discrepancy\nbetween the price of the future and the\nmovement in a Fund's Underlying Index. In the\nevent of adverse price movements, a Fund would\ncontinue to be required to make daily cash\npayments to maintain its required margin. In\nsuch situations, if a Fund has insufficient\ncash, it may have to sell portfolio securities\nto meet daily margin requirements at a time\nwhen it may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, a Fund may be required to deliver\nthe instruments underlying the futures\ncontracts it has sold. The risk of loss in\ntrading futures contracts or uncovered call\noptions in some strategies ( e.g. , selling\nuncovered stock index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit their risk exposure to\nlevels comparable to a direct investment in\nthe types of stocks in which they invest.\n\n13\n\nUtilization of futures and options on futures\nby a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or\neven negative correlation to its Underlying\nIndex if the index underlying the futures\ncontract differs from the Underlying Index.\nThere is also the risk of loss of margin\ndeposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom a Fund has an open position\nin the futures contract or option. The\npurchase of put or call options will be based\nupon predictions by BFA as to anticipated\ntrends, which predictions could prove to be\nincorrect. Because the futures market\ngenerally imposes less burdensome margin\nrequirements than the securities market, an\nincreased amount of participation by\nspeculators in the futures market could result\nin price fluctuations. Certain financial\nfutures exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation permitted in futures contract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\nlimit establishes the maximum amount by which\nthe price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, each\nFund would be required to make daily cash\npayments of variation margin. Risk of\nInvesting in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. An\ninvestment in a Fund involves risks similar to\nthose of investing in portfolios of equity\nsecurities traded on non-U.S. exchanges. These\nrisks include market fluctuations caused by\nsuch factors as economic and political\ndevelopments in those foreign countries,\nchanges in interest rates and perceived trends\nin stock prices. Investing in securities\nissued by issuers domiciled in countries other\nthan the domicile of the investor and\ndenominated in currencies other than an\ninvestor\u2019s local currency entails certain\nconsiderations and risks not typically\nencountered by the investor in making\ninvestments in its home country and in that\ncountry\u2019s currency. These considerations\ninclude favorable or unfavorable changes in\ninterest rates, currency exchange rates,\nexchange control regulations and the costs\nthat may be incurred in connection with\nconversions between various currencies.\nInvesting in any of the Funds also involves\ncertain risks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in a fund whose\nportfolio contains exclusively securities of\nU.S. issuers. These risks include generally\nless liquid and less efficient securities\nmarkets; generally greater price volatility;\nless publicly available information about\nissuers; the imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; the imposition of restrictions on\nthe expatriation of funds or other assets of\nthe Funds; higher transaction and custody\ncosts; delays and risks attendant in\nsettlement procedures; difficulties in\nenforcing contractual obligations; lower\nliquidity and significantly smaller market\ncapitalization; different accounting and\ndisclosure standards; lower levels of\nregulation of the securities markets; more\nsubstantial government interference with the\neconomy and businesses; higher rates of\ninflation; greater social, economic, and\npolitical uncertainty; the risk of\nnationalization or expropriation of assets;\nand the risk of war. Risk of Swap Agreements.\nThe risk of loss with respect to swaps is\ngenerally limited to the net amount of\npayments that a Fund is contractually\nobligated to make. Swap agreements are subject\nto the risk that the swap counterparty will\ndefault on its obligations to pay a Fund and\nthe risk that a Fund will not be able to meet\nits obligations to pay the other party to the\nagreement. If such a default occurs, a Fund\nwill have contractual remedies pursuant to the\nagreements related to the transaction.\nHowever, such remedies may be subject to\nbankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could\naffect such Fund\u2019s rights as a creditor ( e.g.\n, a Fund may not receive the net amount of\npayments that it is contractually entitled to\nreceive). Swap agreements may also involve the\nrisk that there is an imperfect correlation\nbetween the return on the Fund\u2019s obligation to\nits counterparty and the return on the\nreferenced asset. In addition, swap agreements\nare subject to market and liquidity risk,\nleverage risk and hedging risk. A Fund is\nrequired to post and collect variation margin\nand initial margin (comprised of specified\nliquid securities subject to haircuts) in\nconnection with trading of OTC swaps. These\nrequirements may raise the costs for a Fund\u2019s\ninvestment in swaps. Tracking Error Risk. A\nFund may be subject to tracking error, which\nis the divergence of a Fund\u2019s performance from\nthat of the applicable underlying index.\nTracking error may occur because of\ndifferences between the securities and other\ninstruments held in a Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in its applicable underlying\nindex, pricing differences, transaction costs\nincurred by a Fund, a Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in timing of the\naccrual of or the valuation of dividends or\ninterest received by a Fund or distributions\npaid to a Fund\u2019s shareholders, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions carried out\nto minimize the distribution of capital gains\nto shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the applicable underlying index or\nthe costs to a Fund of complying with various\nnew or existing regulatory requirements. This\nrisk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other\n\n14\n\nunusual market conditions. Tracking error also\nmay result because a Fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while its applicable underlying\nindex does not. Tracking error may occur due\nto differences between the methodologies used\nin calculating the value of the applicable\nUnderlying Index and determining a Fund\u2019s NAV.\nWhen an issuer is introduced by an index\nprovider into an index tracked by a Fund, BFA\nmay conduct an analysis on such issuer\u2019s\nsecurities to identify and screen for outlier\nhigh risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual\nprice growth that does not appear to be\nsupported by publicly available information on\nthe business and assets of the issuer, unusual\nor significant short interest or lending\nactivity, negative sentiment, suspended\ntrading or incorrect free-float calculations,\nwhich could be indicators of possible\nirregularities, miscalculations or even\nfraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA\nmay, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the\nrebalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from a\nFund\u2019s portfolio and, if it does so, such a\nfund will be subject to increased tracking\nerror due to the divergence in the securities\nincluded in its portfolio from its underlying\nindex. BFA\u2019s underweighting or excluding such\nsecurities may result in a decline in a Fund\u2019s\nnet asset value. The application of the\nabovementioned analysis and screening to a\nFund and its Underlying Index is in the sole\ndiscretion of BFA and its affiliates (without\nany guarantees). The analysis and screening\nmay not exclude any or all high risk\nsecurities from an Underlying Index or a\nFund\u2019s portfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\na Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more such\nsecurities declines in value. Securities\nLending Risk. A Fund may engage in securities\nlending. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat a Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. A Fund could also lose money in the event\nof a decline in the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or a decline in\nthe value of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for a Fund. Risk of\nInvesting in Mid-Capitalization Companies.\nStock prices of mid-capitalization companies\nmay be more volatile than those of large-\ncapitalization companies, and, therefore, a\nFund\u2019s share price may be more volatile than\nthat of funds that invest a larger percentage\nof their assets in stocks issued by large-\ncapitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-\ncapitalization companies are also more\nvulnerable than those of large-capitalization\ncompanies to adverse business or economic\ndevelopments, and the stocks of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be less liquid\nthan those of large-capitalization companies,\nmaking it more difficult for the Funds to buy\nand sell shares of mid-capitalization\ncompanies. In addition, mid-capitalization\ncompanies generally have less diverse product\nlines than large-capitalization companies and\nare more susceptible to adverse developments\nrelated to their products. Risk of Investing\nin Asia. Investments in securities of issuers\nin certain Asian countries involve risks not\ntypically associated with investments in\nsecurities of issuers in other regions. Such\nheightened risks include, among others,\nexpropriation and/or nationalization of\nassets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of\nintellectual property, data and other security\nbreaches (especially of data stored\nelectronically), political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision-making,\narmed conflict and social instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or socio-\neconomic unrest. Certain Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid rates of economic growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, and there\nis no assurance that these rates of economic\ngrowth and industrialization will be\nmaintained. Certain Asian countries have\ndemocracies with relatively short histories,\nwhich may increase the risk of political\ninstability. These countries have faced\npolitical and military unrest, and further\nunrest could present a risk to their local\neconomies and securities markets. Indonesia\nand the Philippines have each experienced\nviolence and terrorism, which has negatively\nimpacted their economies. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect Asian issuers that\nrely on the U.S. for trade. Political,\nreligious, and border disputes persist in\nIndia. India has recently experienced and may\ncontinue to experience civil unrest and\nhostilities with certain of its neighboring\ncountries. Increased political and social\nunrest in these geographic areas could\nadversely affect the performance of\ninvestments in this region. Certain\ngovernments in this region administer prices\non several basic goods, including fuel and\nelectricity, within their respective\ncountries. Certain governments may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector in their respective countries\nand may own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on\n\n15\n\nthe economic conditions in this region, which\nin turn could have a negative impact on\nprivate sector companies. There is also the\npossibility of diplomatic developments\nadversely affecting investments in the region.\nCorruption and the perceived lack of a rule of\nlaw in dealings with international companies\nin certain Asian countries may discourage\nforeign investment and could negatively impact\nthe long-term growth of certain economies in\nthis region. In addition, certain countries in\nthe region are experiencing high unemployment\nand corruption, and have fragile banking\nsectors. Some economies in this region are\ndependent on a range of commodities, including\noil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, they\nare strongly affected by international\ncommodity prices and particularly vulnerable\nto any weakening in global demand for these\nproducts. The market for securities in this\nregion may also be directly influenced by the\nflow of international capital, and by the\neconomic and market conditions of neighboring\ncountries. China is a key trading partner of\nmany Asian countries and any changes in\ntrading relationships between China and other\nAsian countries may affect the region as a\nwhole. Adverse economic conditions or\ndevelopments in neighboring countries may\nincrease investors' perception of the risk of\ninvesting in the region as a whole, which may\nadversely impact the market value of the\nsecurities issued by companies in the region.\nRisk of Investing in Australasia. The\neconomies of Australasia, which include\nAustralia and New Zealand, are dependent on\nexports from the agricultural and mining\nsectors. This makes Australasian economies\nsusceptible to fluctuations in the commodity\nmarkets. Australasian economies are also\nincreasingly dependent on their growing\nservice and tourism industries. Australia and\nNew Zealand are located in a part of the world\nthat has historically been prone to natural\ndisasters, such as drought and flooding. Any\nsuch event in the future could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the economies of\nAustralia and New Zealand and affect the value\nof securities held by a relevant Fund. The\neconomies of Australia and New Zealand are\ndependent on trading with certain key trading\npartners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic\nevents in the U.S., Asia, or in other key\ntrading countries can have a significant\neconomic effect on the Australasian economies.\nThe economies of Australia and New Zealand are\nheavily dependent on the mining sector.\nPassage of new regulations limiting foreign\nownership of companies in the mining sector or\nimposition of new taxes on profits of mining\ncompanies may dissuade foreign investment, and\nas a result, have a negative impact on\ncompanies to which a Fund has exposure. Risk\nof Investing in Developed Countries. Many\ncountries with developed markets have recently\nexperienced significant economic pressures.\nThese countries generally tend to rely on the\nservices sectors ( e.g. , the financial\nservices sector) as the primary source of\neconomic growth and may be susceptible to the\nrisks of individual service sectors. For\nexample, companies in the financial services\nsector are subject to governmental regulation\nand, recently, government intervention, which\nmay adversely affect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and\namount of capital they must maintain.\nDislocations in the financial sector and\nperceived or actual governmental influence\nover certain financial companies may lead to\ncredit rating downgrades and, as a result,\nimpact, among other things, revenue growth for\nsuch companies. If financial companies\nexperience a prolonged decline in revenue\ngrowth, certain developed countries that rely\nheavily on financial companies as an economic\ndriver may experience a correlative slowdown.\nConcerns have emerged with respect to the\neconomic health of certain developed\ncountries. These concerns primarily stem from\nheavy indebtedness of many developed countries\nand their perceived inability to continue to\nservice high debt loads without simultaneously\nimplementing stringent austerity measures.\nSuch concerns have led to tremendous downward\npressure on the economies of these countries.\nAs a result, it is possible that interest\nrates on debt of certain developed countries\nmay rise to levels that make it difficult for\nsuch countries to service such debt. Spending\non health care and retirement pensions in most\ndeveloped countries has risen dramatically.\nMedical innovation, extended life expectancy\nand higher public expectations are likely to\ncontinue the increase in health care and\npension costs. Any increase in health care and\npension costs will likely have a negative\nimpact on the economic growth of many\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries rely on imports of certain key\nitems, such as crude oil, natural gas, and\nother commodities. As a result, an increase in\ndemand for, or price fluctuations of, certain\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Developed market countries\ngenerally are dependent on the economies of\ncertain key trading partners. Changes in any\none economy may cause an adverse impact on\nseveral developed countries. In addition,\nheavy regulation of, among others, labor and\nproduct markets may have an adverse effect on\ncertain issuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value\nof a Fund\u2019s investments. Risk of Investing in\nEastern Europe. Investing in the securities of\nissuers located or operating in Eastern Europe\nis highly speculative and involves risks not\nusually associated with investing in the more\ndeveloped markets of Western Europe. Certain\nEastern European countries have high public\ndebt levels, significant underground\neconomies, high unemployment and emigration of\nskilled workers. Such countries generally have\na history of political instability, limited\ninfrastructure and an\n\n16\n\ninefficient public sector prone to endemic\ncorruption. Political and economic reforms are\ntoo recent to establish a definite trend away\nfrom centrally planned economies and state-\nowned industries. In the past, some Eastern\nEuropean governments have expropriated\nsubstantial amounts of private property, and\nmany claims of the property owners have never\nbeen fully settled. Many Eastern European\ncountries continue to move toward market\neconomies at different paces with different\ncharacteristics. Many Eastern European\nsecurities markets are generally\nunderdeveloped with low, irregular trading\nvolumes, dubious investor protections, and\noften a dearth of reliable corporate\ninformation. Eastern European securities\nmarkets are generally subject to less\ngovernment supervision and regulation and may\nbe less liquid and more volatile than\nsecurities markets in the U.S. or Western\nEuropean countries. Legal institutions\ngoverning private and foreign investments and\nprivate property may be relatively nascent,\ninefficient, and unevenly enforced or\ninequitably enforced. Certain Eastern European\ngovernments may exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector and\nmay own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in such\ncountries, which could have a negative impact\non a Fund\u2019s investments. Information and\ntransaction costs, differential taxes, and\nsometimes political or transfer risk give a\ncomparative advantage to the domestic investor\nrather than the foreign investor. Eastern\nEuropean economies may also be particularly\nsusceptible to changes in the international\ncredit markets due to their reliance on bank\nrelated inflows of capital. Changes to the\neconomies of countries with substantial\nforeign direct investment in certain Eastern\nEuropean countries may negatively affect the\nregion\u2019s economy. The economy of certain\nEastern European countries may be adversely\naffected by global prices for manufactured\ngoods or commodity price declines to the\nextent that a country relies on the export of\nsuch products. Geopolitical events, including\nwar, and other instability in certain Eastern\nEuropean countries may cause uncertainty in\nthe region\u2019s financial markets and adversely\naffect the performance of the issuers to which\na Fund has exposure. These markets may be\nparticularly sensitive to social, political,\neconomic, and currency events in Russia and\nmay suffer heavy losses as a result of their\ntrading and investment links to the Russian\neconomy and currency. Russia has historically\nasserted its influence in the region using\ndiplomatic, informational, military, and\neconomic instruments of national power, as it\ndid with Georgia in the summer of 2008 and\nUkraine beginning in 2014, and most recently\non February 24, 2022. Russian Invasion of\nUkraine . Russia launched a large-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The\nextent and duration of the military action,\nresulting sanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions, including declines in its\nstock markets and the value of the ruble\nagainst the U.S. dollar, are impossible to\npredict, but could be significant. Disruptions\ncaused by Russian military action or other\nactions (including cyberattacks and espionage)\nor resulting actual and threatened responses\nto such activity, including purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts or changes in\nconsumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich a Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally. Risk\nof Investing in Emerging Markets. Investments\nin emerging market countries may be subject to\ngreater risks than investments in developed\ncountries. These risks include: (i) less\nsocial, political, and economic stability;\n(ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility\ndue to smaller or limited local capital\nmarkets for such securities, or low or non-\nexistent trading volumes; (iii) companies,\ncustodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges\nand broker-dealers may be subject to less\nscrutiny and regulation by local authorities;\n(iv) local governments may decide to seize or\nconfiscate securities held by foreign\ninvestors and/or local governments may decide\nto suspend or limit an issuer's ability to\nmake dividend or interest payments; (v) local\ngovernments may limit or entirely restrict\nrepatriation of invested capital, profits, and\ndividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject\nto local taxation, including on a retroactive\nbasis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on\nstandard payments imposed by local governments\nmay attempt to make dividend or interest\npayments to foreign investors in the local\ncurrency; (viii) there may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and investors may experience\ndifficulty in enforcing legal claims related\nto the securities and/or local judges may\nfavor the interests of the issuer over those\nof foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments\nmay only be permitted to be paid in the local\ncurrency; (x) limited public information\nregarding the issuer may result in greater\ndifficulty in determining market valuations of\nthe securities; and (xi) lack of financial\nreporting on a regular basis, substandard\ndisclosure and differences in accounting\nstandards may make it difficult to ascertain\nthe financial health of an issuer. The Funds\nare not actively managed and do not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations.\n\n17\n\nEmerging market securities markets are\ntypically marked by a high concentration of\nmarket capitalization and trading volume in a\nsmall number of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of ownership of such securities\nby a limited number of investors. In addition,\nbrokerage and other costs associated with\ntransactions in emerging market securities can\nbe higher, sometimes significantly, than\nsimilar costs incurred in securities markets\nin developed countries. Although some emerging\nmarkets have become more established and tend\nto issue securities of higher credit quality,\nthe markets for securities in other emerging\nmarket countries are in the earliest stages of\ntheir development, and these countries issue\nsecurities across the credit spectrum. Even\nthe markets for relatively widely traded\nsecurities in emerging market countries may\nnot be able to absorb, without price\ndisruptions, a significant increase in trading\nvolume or trades of a size customarily\nundertaken by institutional investors in the\nsecurities markets of developed countries. The\nlimited size of many of these securities\nmarkets can cause prices to be erratic for\nreasons apart from factors that affect the\nsoundness and competitiveness of the\nsecurities issuers. For example, prices may be\nunduly influenced by traders who control large\npositions in these markets. Additionally,\nmarket making and arbitrage activities are\ngenerally less extensive in such markets,\nwhich may contribute to increased volatility\nand reduced liquidity of such markets. The\nlimited liquidity of emerging market country\nsecurities may also affect a Fund's ability to\naccurately value its portfolio securities or\nto acquire or dispose of securities at the\nprice and time it wishes to do so or in order\nto meet redemption requests. Many emerging\nmarket countries suffer from uncertainty and\ncorruption in their legal frameworks.\nLegislation may be difficult to interpret and\nlaws may be too new to provide any\nprecedential value. Laws regarding foreign\ninvestment and private property may be weak or\nnon-existent. Sudden changes in governments\nmay result in policies which are less\nfavorable to investors such as policies\ndesigned to expropriate or nationalize \u201c\nsovereign \u201d assets. Certain emerging market\ncountries in the past have expropriated large\namounts of private property, in many cases\nwith little or no compensation, and there can\nbe no assurance that such expropriation will\nnot occur in the future. Investment in the\nsecurities markets of certain emerging market\ncountries is restricted or controlled to\nvarying degrees. These restrictions may limit\na Fund's investment in certain emerging market\ncountries and may increase the expenses of the\nFund. Certain emerging market countries\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestments by foreign persons or limit\ninvestment by foreign persons to only a\nspecified percentage of an issuer's\noutstanding securities or a specific class of\nsecurities which may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\ncompany available for purchase by nationals.\nMany emerging market countries lack the\nsocial, political, and economic stability\ncharacteristic of the U.S. Political\ninstability among emerging market countries\ncan be common and may be caused by an uneven\ndistribution of wealth, social unrest, labor\nstrikes, civil wars, and religious oppression.\nEconomic instability in emerging market\ncountries may take the form of: (i) high\ninterest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation,\nincluding hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of\nunemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes\nin government economic and tax policies,\nincluding confiscatory taxation; and (v)\nimposition of trade barriers. A Fund's income\nand, in some cases, capital gains from foreign\nsecurities will be subject to applicable\ntaxation in certain of the emerging market\ncountries in which it invests, and treaties\nbetween the U.S. and such countries may not be\navailable in some cases to reduce the\notherwise applicable tax rates. Emerging\nmarkets also have different clearance and\nsettlement procedures, and in certain of these\nemerging markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of securities transactions, making\nit difficult to conduct such transactions. In\nthe past, certain governments in emerging\nmarket countries have become overly reliant on\nthe international capital markets and other\nforms of foreign credit to finance large\npublic spending programs, which in the past\nhave caused huge budget deficits. Often,\ninterest payments have become too overwhelming\nfor a government to meet, representing a large\npercentage of total GDP. These foreign\nobligations have become the subject of\npolitical debate and served as fuel for\npolitical parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\n\n18\n\nRisk of Investing in Europe. Investing in\nEuropean countries may expose a Fund to the\neconomic and political risks associated with\nEurope in general and the specific European\ncountries in which it invests. The economies\nand markets of European countries are often\nclosely connected and interdependent, and\nevents in one European country can have an\nadverse impact on other European countries. A\nFund makes investments in securities of\nissuers that are domiciled in, have\nsignificant operations in, or that are listed\non at least one securities exchange within\nmember states of the European Union (the \u201c EU\n\u201d ). A number of countries within the EU are\nalso members of the Economic and Monetary\nUnion (the \u201c eurozone \u201d ) and have adopted the\neuro as their currency. Eurozone membership\nrequires member states to comply with\nrestrictions on inflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates, debt levels and fiscal and\nmonetary controls, each of which may\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe.\nChanges in import or export tariffs, changes\nin governmental or EU regulations on trade,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro and\nother currencies of certain EU countries which\nare not in the eurozone, the default or threat\nof default by an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt, and/or an economic recession\nin an EU member state may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other EU\nmember states and their trading partners.\nAlthough certain European countries are not in\nthe eurozone, many of these countries are\nobliged to meet the criteria for joining the\neurozone. Consequently, these countries must\ncomply with many of the restrictions noted\nabove. The European financial markets have\nexperienced volatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic downturns,\ngovernment debt levels and the possible\ndefault of government debt in several European\ncountries, including, but not limited to,\nAustria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.\nIn order to prevent further economic\ndeterioration, certain countries, without\nprior warning, can institute \u201c capital\ncontrols. \u201d Countries may use these controls\nto restrict volatile movements of capital\nentering and exiting their country. Such\ncontrols may negatively affect a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. A default or debt restructuring\nby any European country would adversely impact\nholders of that country\u2019s debt and sellers of\ncredit default swaps linked to that country\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, which may be located in\ncountries other than those listed above. In\naddition, the credit ratings of certain\nEuropean countries were downgraded in the\npast. These events have adversely affected the\nvalue and exchange rate of the euro and may\ncontinue to significantly affect the economies\nof every country in Europe, including\ncountries that do not use the euro and non-EU\nmember states. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central\nbanks and others, including austerity measures\nand reforms, may not produce the desired\nresults, may result in social unrest and may\nlimit future growth and economic recovery or\nhave other unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The impact of these actions, especially if\nthey occur in a disorderly fashion, is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely impact the value\nof a Fund\u2019s investments in the region. The\nUnited Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) left the EU ( \u201c\nBrexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could\nadversely affect European or worldwide\npolitical, regulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute to instability\nin global political institutions, regulatory\nagencies and financial markets. Certain\nEuropean countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect European issuers\nthat rely on the U.S. for trade. The national\npolitics of countries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding for example, secessionist movements.\nThe governments of European countries may be\nsubject to change and such countries may\nexperience social and political unrest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region also could impact financial\nmarkets. The impact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of a Fund's investments. Russian\nInvasion of Ukraine . Russia launched a large-\nscale invasion of Ukraine on February 24,\n2022. The extent and duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and resulting\nfuture market disruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the value of the\nruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible\nto predict, but could be significant.\nDisruptions caused by Russian military action\nor other actions (including cyberattacks and\nespionage) or resulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity, including\npurchasing and financing restrictions,\nboycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser\npreferences, sanctions, import and export\nrestrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian companies or\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nmay impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which a Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally.\n\n19\n\nRisk of Investing in Finland. Investment in\nFinnish issuers involves risks that are\nspecific to Finland, including, legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security and\neconomic risks. Finland\u2019s economy, among other\nthings, depends on imported raw materials,\nenergy and components for its manufactured\nproducts. As a result, Finland is dependent on\ntrading relationships with certain key trading\npartners, including other EU countries,\nRussia, China and the U.S. Metals, engineering\nand timber are Finland\u2019s main industries, and\nmajor exports include electronics and\nmachinery. Finland\u2019s reliance on these sectors\nmakes it vulnerable to economic downturns in,\namong other sectors, the technology and\nindustrials sectors. Secessionist movements in\ncertain European countries, such as the\nCatalan movement in Spain and the independence\nmovement in Scotland, may have an adverse\neffect on the Finnish economy. Risk of\nInvesting in Germany. Investment in German\nissuers will subject a Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security, and\neconomic risks specific to Germany. Ongoing\nconcerns in relation to the economic health of\nthe EU continue to constrain the economic\nresilience of certain EU member states,\nincluding Germany. Germany has a large export-\nreliant manufacturing and industrials sector\nand the German economy is dependent to a\nsignificant extent on the economies of certain\nkey trading partners, including the U.S.,\nFrance, Italy and other European countries.\nReduction in spending on German products and\nservices, or changes in any of the economies\nmay have an adverse impact on the German\neconomy. In addition, heavy regulation of\nlabor and product markets in Germany may have\nan adverse effect on German issuers. Such\nregulations may negatively impact economic\ngrowth or cause prolonged periods of\nrecession. Risk of Investing in Indonesia.\nInvestment in securities of Indonesian issuers\ninvolves risks not typically associated with\ninvestments in securities of issuers in\ndeveloped countries. Such heightened risks\ninclude, among others, expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, political instability, including\nauthoritarian and/or military involvement in\ngovernmental decision-making, armed conflict\nand social instability as a result of\nreligious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest.\nThe securities market of Indonesia is\nconsidered an emerging market characterized by\na small number of listed companies, high price\nvolatility and a relatively illiquid secondary\ntrading market. These factors, coupled with\nrestrictions on foreign investment and other\nfactors, limit the supply of securities\navailable for investment by a Fund. This will\naffect the rate at which a Fund is able to\ninvest in Indonesia, the purchase and sale\nprices for such securities and the timing of\npurchases and sales. Indonesia\u2019s political\ninstitutions and democracy have a relatively\nshort history, increasing the risk of\npolitical instability. In the recent past,\nIndonesia has faced political and militant\nunrest, and further unrest could present a\nrisk to the local economy and securities\nmarkets. Indonesia has also experienced acts\nof terrorism, predominantly targeted at\nforeigners, which has had a negative impact on\ntourism and consequently has negatively\nimpacted the economy of Indonesia. Corruption\nand the perceived lack of a rule of law in\ndealings with international companies may\ndiscourage foreign direct investment and could\nnegatively impact the long-term growth of the\neconomy of Indonesia. In addition, many\neconomic development problems remain,\nincluding high unemployment, a fragile banking\nsector, endemic corruption, inadequate\ninfrastructure, a poor investment climate, and\nunequal resource distribution among regions.\nThe Indonesian economy is dependent on a range\nof commodities including oil, natural gas and\ncoal. Accordingly, it is strongly affected by\ninternational commodity prices and is\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. Any acts of\nterrorism or armed conflicts in Indonesia or\ninternationally could have an adverse effect\non the financial and commodities markets and\nthe global economy. The Indonesian government\nplays a significant role in Indonesia\u2019s\neconomy, including administering prices on\nseveral basic goods, including fuel, rice and\nelectricity. The Indonesian government may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in Indonesia, which could\nhave a negative impact on private sector\ncompanies. There is also the possibility of\ndiplomatic developments that could adversely\naffect investments in Indonesia. The market\nfor Indonesian securities is directly\ninfluenced by the flow of international\ncapital, and economic and market conditions of\ncertain countries, especially emerging market\ncountries in Southeastern Asia. Adverse\neconomic conditions or developments in other\nemerging market countries have at times\nsignificantly affected the availability of\ncredit in the Indonesian economy and resulted\nin considerable outflows of funds and declines\nin the amount of foreign currency invested in\nIndonesia. A crisis in neighboring emerging\nmarket countries also may increase investors\u2019\nperception of risk in Indonesia, which may\nadversely impact the market value of the\nsecurities issued by Indonesian companies,\nincluding securities in which a Fund may\ninvest.\n\n20\n\nRisk of Investing in Ireland. Investing in\nsecurities of companies domiciled in Ireland\ninvolves special considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in the U.S. market.\nSuch heightened risks include, among others,\nongoing sectarian conflict, social instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest, potential armed conflict\nand/or threats of terrorism within the\ncountry, continued lack of unification as a\ncountry, and internal hostile relations, all\nwhich can adversely impact the Irish economy.\nConsumer indebtedness in Ireland has been high\nand increasing in recent years, leading to\nconcern with respect to overall economic\ngrowth in Ireland. Ireland relies heavily on\nexports to its key trading partners that\ninclude the other members of the EU and the\nU.S. Reduction in spending by these economies\non Irish products and services or negative\nchanges in any of these economies may cause an\nadverse impact on the Irish economy. Any\nchanges in the price or demand for Irish\nexports could adversely impact Ireland\u2019s\neconomy. Ireland\u2019s economy may also be\nnegatively affected if trade barriers,\nexchange controls, or other protectionist\nmeasures are imposed or negotiated by the\ncountries with which they trade. As a member\nof the EU, Ireland is heavily dependent on the\nother member states both economically and\npolitically. The referendum by the U.K. in\nJune 2016 resolving to leave the EU may have\nan adverse impact on a Fund and its\nshareholders. The European Central Bank has\ncontrol over each member country\u2019s monetary\npolicies, including inflation rates, deficit\nlevels, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal\nand monetary controls. However, the Irish\ngovernment has retained the authority to set\ntax and spending policies and public debt\nlevels. Any event within the EU, including\neconomic and political developments, can cause\nmarket disruptions, and can adversely affect\nthe values of securities held by a Fund. Risk\nof Investing in Japan. Japan may be subject to\npolitical, economic, labor and other risks.\nAny of these risks, individually or in the\naggregate, can impact an investment made in\nJapan. Currency Risk . The Japanese yen has\nfluctuated widely at times and any increase in\nits value may cause a decline in exports that\ncould weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has,\nin the past, intervened in the currency\nmarkets to attempt to maintain or reduce the\nvalue of the yen. Japanese intervention in the\ncurrency markets could cause the value of the\nyen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and\ncould cause losses to investors. Economic Risk\n. The growth of Japan\u2019s economy has recently\nlagged that of its Asian neighbors and other\nmajor developed economies. Since 2000, Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth rate has generally remained\nlow relative to other advanced economies, and\nit may remain low in the future. The Japanese\neconomy is heavily dependent on international\ntrade and has been adversely affected by trade\ntariffs, other protectionist measures,\ncompetition from emerging economies and the\neconomic conditions of its trading partners.\nJapan is also heavily dependent on oil\nimports, and higher commodity prices could\ntherefore have a negative impact on the\nJapanese economy. Geographic Risk . Natural\ndisasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic\neruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur\nin Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy, and,\nin turn, could negatively affect a Fund. Labor\nRisk . Japan has an aging workforce and has\nexperienced a significant population decline\nin recent years. Japan\u2019s labor market appears\nto be undergoing fundamental structural\nchanges, as a labor market traditionally\naccustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to\nmeet the need for increased labor mobility,\nwhich may adversely affect Japan\u2019s economic\ncompetitiveness. Large Government and\nCorporate Debt Risk . The Japanese economy\nfaces several concerns, including a financial\nsystem with large levels of nonperforming\nloans, over-leveraged corporate balance\nsheets, extensive cross-ownership by major\ncorporations, a changing corporate governance\nstructure, and large government deficits.\nThese issues may cause a slowdown of the\nJapanese economy. Political Risk .\nHistorically, Japan has had unpredictable\nnational politics and may experience frequent\npolitical turnover. Future political\ndevelopments may lead to changes in policy\nthat might adversely affect a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. In addition, China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan. Japan\u2019s\npolitical relationship with China, however,\nhas been strained. Should political tension\nincrease, it could adversely affect the\nJapanese economy and destabilize the region as\na whole. Security Risk. Japan's relations with\nits neighbors, particularly China, North\nKorea, South Korea and Russia, have at times\nbeen strained due to territorial disputes,\nhistorical animosities and defense concerns.\nMost recently, the Japanese government has\nshown concern over the increased nuclear and\nmilitary activity by North Korea and China.\nStrained relations may cause uncertainty in\nthe Japanese markets and adversely affect the\noverall Japanese economy, particularly in\ntimes of crisis.\n\n21\n\nRisk of Investing in the Middle East. Many\nMiddle Eastern countries have little or no\ndemocratic tradition, and the political and\nlegal systems in such countries may have an\nadverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in\nthe Middle East are highly reliant on income\nfrom the sale of oil and natural gas or trade\nwith countries involved in the sale of oil and\nnatural gas, and their economies are therefore\nvulnerable to changes in the market for oil\nand natural gas and foreign currency values.\nAs global demand for oil and natural gas\nfluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may\nbe significantly impacted. In addition, many\nMiddle Eastern governments have exercised and\ncontinue to exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector. In\ncertain cases, a Middle Eastern country\u2019s\ngovernment may own or control many companies,\nincluding some of the largest companies in the\ncountry. Accordingly, governmental actions in\nthe future could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Middle Eastern\ncountries. This could affect private sector\ncompanies and a Fund, as well as the value of\nsecurities in the Fund's portfolio. Certain\nMiddle Eastern markets are in the earliest\nstages of development. As a result, there may\nbe a high concentration of market\ncapitalization and trading volume in a small\nnumber of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of investors and financial\nintermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern\ncountries typically are fewer in number and\nless capitalized than brokers in the U.S. The\nlegal systems in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries also may have an adverse impact on a\nFund. For example, the potential liability of\na shareholder in a U.S. corporation with\nrespect to acts of the corporation generally\nis limited to the amount of the shareholder\u2019s\ninvestment. However, the notion of limited\nliability is less clear in certain Middle\nEastern countries. A Fund therefore may be\nliable in certain Middle Eastern countries for\nthe acts of a corporation in which it invests\nfor an amount greater than its actual\ninvestment in that corporation. Similarly, the\nrights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers\nmay be more limited than those of shareholders\nof a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain or enforce a legal\njudgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some\nMiddle Eastern countries prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on investments in\ntheir capital markets, particularly their\nequity markets, by foreign entities such as a\nFund. For example, certain countries may\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestment by foreign persons or limit the\namount of investment by foreign persons in a\nparticular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern\ncountries may also limit investment by foreign\npersons to only a specific class of securities\nof an issuer that may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\nissuer available for purchase by nationals of\nthe relevant Middle Eastern country. The\nmanner in which foreign investors may invest\nin companies in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries, as well as limitations on those\ninvestments, may have an adverse impact on the\noperations of a Fund. For example, in certain\nof these countries, a Fund may be required to\ninvest initially through a local broker or\nother entity and then have the shares that\nwere purchased re-registered in the name of a\nFund. Re-registration in some instances may\nnot be possible on a timely basis. This may\nresult in a delay during which a Fund may be\ndenied certain of its rights as an investor,\nincluding rights as to dividends or to be made\naware of certain corporate actions. There also\nmay be instances where a Fund places a\npurchase order but is subsequently informed,\nat the time of re-registration, that the\npermissible allocation of the investment to\nforeign investors has already been filled and,\nconsequently, a Fund may not be able to invest\nin the relevant company. Substantial\nlimitations may exist in certain Middle\nEastern countries with respect to a Fund\u2019s\nability to repatriate investment income or\ncapital gains. A Fund could be adversely\naffected by delays in, or a refusal to grant,\nany required governmental approval for\nrepatriation of capital, as well as by the\napplication to a Fund of any restrictions on\ninvestment. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nmay be heavily dependent upon international\ntrade and, consequently, have been and may\ncontinue to be negatively affected by trade\nbarriers, exchange controls, managed\nadjustments in relative currency values and\nother protectionist measures imposed or\nnegotiated by the countries with which they\ntrade. These countries also have been and may\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by economic\nconditions in the countries with which they\ntrade. In addition, certain issuers located in\nMiddle Eastern countries in which a Fund\ninvests may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer which operates in, or\nhas dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as\nan investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. Certain\nMiddle Eastern countries have strained\nrelations with other Middle Eastern countries\ndue to territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, international alliances, defense\nconcerns or other reasons, which may adversely\naffect the economies of these Middle Eastern\ncountries. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nexperience significant unemployment, as well\nas widespread underemployment. There has also\nbeen a recent increase in recruitment efforts\nand an aggressive push for\n\n22\n\nterritorial control by terrorist groups in the\nregion, which has led to an outbreak of\nwarfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has\nspread to surrounding areas, including many\nportions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities\nmay continue into the future or may escalate\nat any time due to ethnic, racial, political,\nreligious or ideological tensions between\ngroups in the region or foreign intervention\nor lack of intervention, among other factors.\nRisk of Investing in New Zealand. Investment\nin the New Zealand market involves special\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the U.S. market. Although New\nZealand encourages foreign investment, its\nOverseas Investment Office must give consent\nto certain foreign investments based on a\nnational interest determination. A delay in\nobtaining such approval can delay investments\nin New Zealand and, as a result, a Fund may\nnot be able to invest in certain securities\nwhile approval is pending. Furthermore,\napproval could be rejected or a Fund's\ninvestments may be affected by a limitation in\nthe number of investors interested in a\nparticular industry and/or issuer, and any one\nof these factors could cause a decline in the\nvalue of the Fund. New Zealand\u2019s economy\nhistorically has been based on a foundation of\nagricultural exports. Accordingly, natural\ndisasters, particularly earthquakes which\noccur regularly in New Zealand, can have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the economy. New\nZealand is heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, has\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich it trades. Reduction in spending,\nparticularly by key trading partners, on New\nZealand products and services may cause an\nadverse impact on the New Zealand economy. New\nZealand\u2019s economy may be negatively affected\nif trade barriers, exchange controls, managed\nadjustments in relative currency values or\nother protectionist measures are imposed or\nnegotiated by the countries with which it\ntrades. Risk of Investing in North America. A\ndecrease in imports or exports, changes in\ntrade regulations or an economic recession in\nany North American country can have a\nsignificant economic effect on the entire\nNorth American region and on some or all of\nthe North American countries in which a Fund\ninvests. The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's\nlargest trading and investment partner. The\nCanadian and Mexican economies are\nsignificantly affected by developments in the\nU.S. economy. Since the implementation of the\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement ( \u201c NAFTA\n\u201d ) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico,\ntotal merchandise trade among the three\ncountries has increased. However, political\ndevelopments including the implementation of\ntariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation of\nNAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-\nCanada Agreement ( \u201c USMCA \u201d ), which replaced\nNAFTA on July 1, 2020, could negatively affect\nNorth America\u2019s economic outlook and, as a\nresult, the value of securities held by a\nFund. Policy and legislative changes in one\ncountry may have a significant effect on North\nAmerican markets generally, as well as on the\nvalue of certain securities held by a Fund.\nRisk of Investing in the Philippines.\nInvestment in securities of Philippine issuers\ninvolves risks not typically associated with\ninvestments in securities of issuers in\ndeveloped countries. The Philippines has\nexperienced a high level of debt and public\nspending, which may stifle economic growth,\ncontribute to prolonged periods of recession\nor lower the country\u2019s sovereign debt rating\nand adversely impact investments in a Fund.\nLarge, unprofitable public enterprises,\nespecially in the energy sector, contribute to\nthe government\u2019s debt because of slow progress\non privatization. The Philippines\u2019 democracy\nhas a relatively short history, increasing the\nrisk of political instability. The Philippines\nhas in the past faced political and militant\nunrest, and further unrest could present a\nrisk to the local economy and securities\nmarkets. The Philippines\u2019 political history is\nmarred with widespread fraud and violence. The\nPhilippines has periodically experienced and\nis currently experiencing violence and\nterrorism, including international terrorist\norganizations. Any acts of terrorism or armed\nconflicts in the Philippines or\ninternationally could have an adverse effect\non the financial and commodities markets and\nthe global economy. Furthermore, the\ngeopolitical conflict created by China\u2019s\nclaims in the South China Sea has created\ndiplomatic tension. Such increased political\nand social unrest in any neighboring country\ncould cause further economic and market\nuncertainty in the region. The Philippines\u2019\neconomy is heavily dependent on exports,\nparticularly electronics and semiconductors.\nThe Philippines\u2019 reliance on these sectors\nmakes it vulnerable to economic downturns\nduring periods of slumps in the information\ntechnology sectors. In addition, many economic\ndevelopment problems remain, including high\nunemployment, inadequate infrastructure,\nendemic corruption, poverty, and intensifying\nglobal competition from neighboring countries.\nThe Philippine government may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector and may own or control many\ncompanies. Future government actions could\nhave a significant effect on the economic\nconditions in the\n\n23\n\nPhilippines, which could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments that could adversely affect\ninvestments in the Philippines. The market for\nPhilippine securities is directly influenced\nby the flow of international capital, and\neconomic and market conditions of certain\ncountries, especially emerging market\ncountries in Southeastern Asia. Adverse\neconomic conditions or developments in other\nemerging market countries have at times\nsignificantly affected the availability of\ncredit in the Philippine economy and resulted\nin considerable outflows of funds and declines\nin the amount of foreign currency invested in\nthe Philippines. A crisis in neighboring\nemerging market countries also may increase\ninvestors\u2019 perception of risk in the\nPhilippines, which may adversely impact the\nmarket value of the securities issued by\nPhilippine companies, including securities in\nwhich a Fund may invest. Risk of Investing in\nPoland. Investment in securities of Polish\nissuers involves risks not typically\nassociated with investments in securities of\nissuers in developed countries. Such\nheightened risks include, among others, a\nrelatively short history of democracy,\nexpropriation and/or nationalization of\nassets, confiscatory taxation, less publicly\navailable financial and other information, and\npotential difficulties in enforcing\ncontractual obligations. In addition, Poland\nfaces many economic development problems,\nincluding high unemployment, inadequate\ninfrastructure, endemic corruption, poverty,\nand intensifying global competition from\nneighboring countries. Securities laws in\nPoland are relatively new and unsettled and,\nconsequently, there is a risk of rapid and\nunpredictable change in laws regarding foreign\ninvestment, securities regulation, custody and\ntitle to securities and shareholder rights.\nAccordingly, foreign investors may be\nadversely affected by new or amended laws and\nregulations. In circumstances where adequate\nlaws and shareholder rights exist, it may not\nbe possible to obtain swift and equitable\nenforcement of the law. The securities market\nof Poland is considered an emerging market\ncharacterized by a small number of listed\ncompanies and a relatively illiquid secondary\ntrading market, particularly for corporate\nbonds. These factors, coupled with\nrestrictions on foreign investment and other\nfactors, limit the supply of securities\navailable for investment by a Fund. This will\naffect the rate at which a Fund is able to\ninvest in Poland, the purchase and sale prices\nfor such securities and the timing of\npurchases and sales. The government in Poland\nmay restrict or control to varying degrees the\nability of foreign investors to invest in\nsecurities of issuers located or operating in\nPoland. Moreover, governmental approval or\nspecial licenses prior to investments by\nforeign investors may be required and may\nlimit the amount of investments by foreign\ninvestors in a particular industry and/or\nissuer. A delay in obtaining a required\ngovernment approval or license would delay\ninvestments in Poland, and, as a result, a\nFund may not be able to invest in certain\nsecurities while approval is pending. The\ngovernment of Poland may also withdraw or\ndecline to renew a license that enables a Fund\nto invest in Poland. Any one of these factors\ncould cause a decline in the value of a Fund.\nThe Polish government may exercise substantial\ninfluence over many aspects of the private\nsector and may own or control many companies.\nFuture government actions could have a\nsignificant effect on the economic conditions\nin Poland, which could have a negative impact\non private sector companies. There is also the\npossibility of diplomatic developments that\ncould adversely affect investments in Poland.\nThe market for Polish securities is directly\ninfluenced by the flow of international\ncapital, and economic and market conditions of\ncertain countries, especially emerging market\ncountries in Eastern Europe. Adverse economic\nconditions or developments in other emerging\nmarket countries have at times significantly\naffected the availability of credit in the\nPolish economy and resulted in considerable\noutflows of funds and declines in the amount\nof foreign currency invested in Poland. U.S.\nEconomic Trading Partners Risk. The U.S. is a\nsignificant, and in some cases the most\nsignificant, trading partner of, or foreign\ninvestor in, certain countries in which a Fund\ninvests. As a result, economic conditions of\nsuch countries may be particularly affected by\nchanges in the U.S. economy. A decrease in\nU.S. imports or exports, new trade and\nfinancial regulations or tariffs, changes in\nthe U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic\nslowdown in the U.S. may have a material\nadverse effect on a country\u2019s economic\nconditions and, as a result, securities to\nwhich a Fund has exposure. Circumstances could\narise that could prevent the timely payment of\ninterest or principal on U.S. government debt,\nsuch as reaching the legislative \u201c debt\nceiling. \u201d Such non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences for the U.S.\neconomy and the global financial system.\n\n24\n\nThere are strained relations between the U.S.\nand a number of foreign countries. If these\nrelations were to worsen, it could adversely\naffect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S.\nissuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The\nU.S. has also experienced increased internal\nunrest and discord. If this trend were to\ncontinue, it may have an adverse impact on the\nU.S. economy and many of the issuers in which\na Fund invests. Risk of Investing in the Basic\nMaterials Industry. Issuers in the basic\nmaterials industry could be adversely affected\nby commodity price volatility, inflation,\nexchange rate fluctuations, social and\npolitical unrest, import controls and\nincreased competition. Companies in the basic\nmaterials industry may be subject to swift\nfluctuations in supply and demand.\nFluctuations may be caused by events relating\nto political and economic developments, the\nenvironmental impact of basic materials\noperations, and the success of exploration\nprojects. Production of industrial materials\noften exceeds demand as a result of over-\nbuilding or economic downturns, leading to\npoor investment returns. Issuers in the basic\nmaterials industry are at risk for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may be adversely affected by\ndepletion of resources, delays in technical\nprogress, labor relations, tax and government\nregulations related to changes to, among other\nthings, energy and environmental policies.\nRisk of Investing in the Communication\nServices Sector. The communication services\nsector consists of both companies in the\ntelecommunication services industry as well as\nthose in the media and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the telecommunication\nservices industry group include providers of\nfiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services and products\nincluding television broadcasting, gaming\nproducts, social media, networking platforms,\nonline classifieds, online review websites,\nand Internet search engines. Companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be affected\nby industry competition, substantial capital\nrequirements, government regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications products and\nservices due to technological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and international demand,\nshifting demographics and often unpredictable\nchanges in consumer tastes can drastically\naffect a communication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue.\n\n25\n\nRisk of Investing in the Consumer Defensive\nIndustry. A Fund is subject to risks faced by\ncompanies in the consumer defensive industry,\nincluding: governmental regulation affecting\nthe permissibility of using various food\nadditives and production methods, which could\naffect profitability; new laws or litigation\nthat may adversely affect tobacco companies;\nfads, marketing campaigns and other factors\naffecting supply and demand that may strongly\naffect securities prices and profitability of\nfood, beverage and fashion related products;\nand international events that may affect food\nand beverage companies that derive a\nsubstantial portion of their net income from\nforeign countries. Risk of Investing in the\nConsumer Discretionary Sector. Companies\nengaged in the design, production or\ndistribution of products or services for the\nconsumer discretionary sector (including,\nwithout limitation, television and radio\nbroadcasting, manufacturing, publishing,\nrecording and musical instruments, motion\npictures, photography, amusement and theme\nparks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and\nsports arenas, camping and recreational\nequipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-\nrelated services, automobiles, hotels and\nmotels, and fast food and other restaurants)\nare subject to the risk that their products or\nservices may become obsolete quickly. The\nsuccess of these companies can depend heavily\non disposable household income and consumer\nspending. During periods of an expanding\neconomy, the consumer discretionary sector may\noutperform the consumer staples sector, but\nmay underperform when economic conditions\nworsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary\nsector can be significantly affected by\nseveral factors, including, without\nlimitation, the performance of domestic and\ninternational economies, exchange rates,\nchanging consumer preferences, demographics,\nmarketing campaigns, cyclical revenue\ngeneration, consumer confidence, commodity\nprice volatility, labor relations, interest\nrates, import and export controls, intense\ncompetition, technological developments and\ngovernment regulation. Risk of Investing in\nthe Consumer Staples Sector. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector may be adversely\naffected by changes in the global economy,\nconsumer spending, competition, demographics\nand consumer preferences, and production\nspending. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may also be affected by changes in\nglobal economic, environmental and political\nevents, economic conditions, the depletion of\nresources, and government regulation. For\ninstance, government regulations may affect\nthe permissibility of using various food\nadditives and production methods of companies\nthat make food products, which could affect\ncompany profitability. In addition, tobacco\ncompanies may be adversely affected by the\nadoption of proposed legislation and/or by\nlitigation. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector also may be subject to risks pertaining\nto the supply of, demand for and prices of raw\nmaterials. The prices of raw materials\nfluctuate in response to a number of factors,\nincluding, without limitation, changes in\ngovernment agricultural support programs,\nexchange rates, import and export controls,\nchanges in international agricultural and\ntrading policies, and seasonal and weather\nconditions. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Risk of Investing in the Energy\nSector. Companies in the energy sector are\nstrongly affected by the changes in and\nvolatility of global energy prices, energy\nsupply and demand, government regulations and\npolicies, energy production and conservation\nefforts, technological change, development of\nalternative energy sources, and other factors\nthat they cannot control. Energy companies may\nhave relatively high levels of debt and may be\nmore likely to restructure their businesses if\nthere are downturns in energy markets or in\nthe global economy. If an energy company in a\nFund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund\ncould lose all or a substantial portion of its\ninvestment. The energy sector is cyclical and\nis highly dependent on commodity prices.\nPrices and supplies of energy may fluctuate\nsignificantly over short and long periods of\ntime due to, among other things, national and\ninternational political changes, Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d )\npolicies, changes in relationships among OPEC\nmembers and between OPEC and oil-importing\nnations, the regulatory environment, taxation\npolicies, the enactment or cessation of trade\nsanctions, war or other geopolitical\nconflicts, and the economies of key energy-\nconsuming countries. Companies in the energy\nsector may be adversely affected by terrorism,\ncyber incidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. While certain Funds seek to\ninvest in companies with positive or favorable\nenvironmental and social characteristics,\ncompanies in the energy sector are at risk of\nliability from accidents resulting in injury,\nloss of life or property, pollution or other\nenvironmental damage claims. Significant oil\nand gas deposits are located in emerging\nmarkets countries where corruption and\nsecurity may raise significant risks, in\naddition to the other risks of investing in\nemerging markets. Additionally, the Middle\nEast, where many companies in the energy\nsector may operate, has experienced conflict\nand unrest. Companies in the energy sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes in\nexchange rates, interest rates, economic\nconditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy\n\n26\n\nsector is highly regulated. Entities operating\nin the energy sector are subject to\nsignificant regulation of nearly every aspect\nof their operations by governmental agencies.\nSuch regulation can change rapidly or over\ntime in both scope and intensity. Stricter\nlaws, regulations or enforcement policies\ncould be enacted, which would likely increase\ncompliance costs and may materially adversely\naffect the financial performance of companies\nin the energy sector. The energy sector may\nexperience significant market volatility. For\nexample, Russia\u2019s large-scale invasion of\nUkraine on February 24, 2022 led to further\ndisruptions and increased volatility in the\nenergy and commodity futures markets due to\nactual and potential disruptions in the supply\nand demand for certain commodities, including\noil and natural gas. The U.S. and other actors\nhave enacted various sanctions and\nrestrictions on business dealings with Russia,\nwhich include restrictions on imports of oil,\nnatural gas and coal. The effect of the\ncurrent sanctions and restrictions, as well as\nthe extent and duration of the Russian\nmilitary action, additional sanctions and\nassociated market disruptions on the energy\nsector, are impossible to predict and depend\non a number of factors. The effect of these\nevents or any related developments could be\nsignificant and may have a severe adverse\neffect on the performance of a Fund. Risk of\nInvesting in the Financials Sector. Companies\nin the financials sector include small,\nregional and money center banks, securities\nbrokerage firms, asset management companies,\nsavings banks and thrift institutions,\nspecialty finance companies ( e.g. , credit\ncard, mortgage providers), insurance and\ninsurance brokerage firms, consumer finance\nfirms, financial conglomerates and foreign\nbanking and financial companies. Most\nfinancial companies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which limits their\nactivities and may affect their ability to\nearn a profit from a given line of business.\nGovernment regulation may change frequently\nand may have significant adverse consequences\nfor companies in the financials sector,\nincluding effects not intended by the\nregulation. Direct governmental intervention\nin the operations of financial companies and\nfinancial markets may materially and adversely\naffect the companies in which a Fund invests,\nincluding legislation in many countries that\nmay increase government regulation,\nrepatriation and other intervention. The\nimpact of governmental intervention and\nlegislative changes on any individual\nfinancial company or on the financials sector\nas a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation\nof financial companies has been and continues\nto be subject to unprecedented volatility and\nmay be influenced by unpredictable factors,\nincluding interest rate risk and sovereign\ndebt default. Certain financial businesses are\nsubject to intense competitive pressures,\nincluding market share and price competition.\nFinancial companies in foreign countries are\nsubject to market-specific and general\nregulatory and interest rate concerns. In\nparticular, government regulation in certain\nforeign countries may include taxes and\ncontrols on interest rates, credit\navailability, minimum capital requirements,\nbans on short sales, limits on prices and\nrestrictions on currency transfers. In\naddition, companies in the financials sector\nmay be the targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or customer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe profitability of banks, savings and loan\nassociations and other financial companies is\nlargely dependent on the availability and cost\nof capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change; for\ninstance, when interest rates go up, the value\nof securities issued by many types of\ncompanies in the financials sector generally\ngoes down. In other words, financial companies\nmay be adversely affected in certain market\ncycles, including, without limitation, during\nperiods of rising interest rates, which may\nrestrict the availability and increase the\ncost of capital, and during periods of\ndeclining economic conditions, which may\ncause, among other things, credit losses due\nto financial difficulties of borrowers. In\naddition, general economic conditions are\nimportant to the operations of these\ncompanies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise\n\n27\n\ncapital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products. Patents have a limited\nduration, and, upon expiration, other\ncompanies may market substantially similar \u201c\ngeneric \u201d products that are typically sold at\na lower price than the patented product, which\ncan cause the original developer of the\nproduct to lose market share and/or reduce the\nprice charged for the product, resulting in\nlower profits for the original developer. As a\nresult, the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. In addition, because the products\nand services of many companies in the\nhealthcare sector affect the health and well-\nbeing of many individuals, these companies are\nespecially susceptible to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and similar claims.\nHealthcare companies are subject to\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Many new products in the\nhealthcare sector may be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of obtaining such\napprovals may be long and costly, which can\nresult in increased development costs, delayed\ncost recovery and loss of competitive\nadvantage to the extent that rival companies\nhave developed competing products or\nprocedures, adversely affecting the company\u2019s\nrevenues and profitability. In other words,\ndelays in the regulatory approval process may\ndiminish the opportunity for a company to\nprofit from a new product or to bring a new\nproduct to market, which could have a material\nadverse effect on a company\u2019s business.\nHealthcare companies may also be strongly\naffected by scientific biotechnology or\ntechnological developments, and their products\nmay quickly become obsolete. Also, many\nhealthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Industrials Sector. The value\nof securities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply of and demand for both their\nspecific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, while certain Funds seek to\ninvest in companies with positive or favorable\nenvironmental, social, and governance ( \u201c ESG\n\u201d ) characteristics, companies in the\nindustrials sector may be subject to liability\nfor environmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Information\nTechnology Sector. Information technology\ncompanies face intense competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, which may\nhave an adverse effect on profit margins. Like\nother technology companies, information\ntechnology companies may have limited product\nlines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. The products of information\ntechnology companies may face product\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent\n\n28\n\nnew product introduction, unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for\nthe services of qualified personnel.\nTechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology, especially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the overall market.\nCompanies in the information technology sector\nare heavily dependent on patent and\nintellectual property rights. The loss or\nimpairment of these rights may adversely\naffect the profitability of these companies.\nInformation technology companies are facing\nincreased government and regulatory scrutiny\nand may be subject to adverse government or\nregulatory action. Finally, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ninformation technology sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThese risks are heightened for information\ntechnology companies in foreign markets. Risk\nof Investing in the Materials Sector.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control,\namong other factors. Such risks may adversely\naffect the issuers to which a Fund has\nexposure. While certain Funds seek to invest\nin companies with positive or favorable ESG\ncharacteristics, companies in the materials\nsector are also at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in the Real\nEstate Industry. Companies in the real estate\nindustry include companies that invest in real\nestate, such as REITs, real estate holding and\noperating companies or real estate development\ncompanies (collectively, \u201c Real Estate\nCompanies \u201d ). Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies exposes investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly, as well as to\nrisks that relate specifically to the way in\nwhich Real Estate Companies are organized and\noperated. The real estate industry is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and developments, and characterized\nby intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies involves various risks. Some risks\nthat are specific to Real Estate Companies are\ndiscussed in greater detail below.\nConcentration Risk. Real Estate Companies may\nown a limited number of properties and\nconcentrate their investments in a particular\ngeographic region or property type. Economic\ndownturns affecting a particular region,\nindustry or property type may lead to a high\nvolume of defaults within a short period.\nDistressed Investment Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in distressed, defaulted\nor out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and\nimplementation by a Real Estate Company of\nloan modification and restructure programs\ninvolves a high degree of uncertainty. Even\nsuccessful implementation may still require\nadverse compromises and may not prevent\nbankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also\ninvest in other debt instruments that may\nbecome non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt or erratic\nprice fluctuations. In addition, real estate\nis relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other capital\nexpenditures, the income and ability of a Real\nEstate Company to make payments of any\ninterest and principal on its debt securities\nwill be adversely affected.\n\n29\n\nLoan Foreclosure Risk. Real Estate Companies\nmay foreclose on loans that the Real Estate\nCompany originated and/or acquired.\nForeclosure may generate negative publicity\nfor the underlying property that affects its\nmarket value. In addition to the length and\nexpense of such proceedings, the validity of\nthe terms of the applicable loan may not be\nrecognized in foreclosure proceedings. Claims\nand defenses asserted by borrowers or other\nlenders may interfere with the enforcement of\nrights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel\nproceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also\ndelay resolution and limit the amount of\nrecovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate\nCompany even where the property underlying the\nloan is liquidated. Management Risk. Real\nEstate Companies are dependent upon management\nskills and may have limited financial\nresources. Real Estate Companies are generally\nnot diversified and may be subject to heavy\ncash flow dependency, default by borrowers and\nvoluntary liquidation. In addition,\ntransactions between Real Estate Companies and\ntheir affiliates may be subject to conflicts\nof interest, which may adversely affect a Real\nEstate Company\u2019s shareholders. A Real Estate\nCompany may also have joint venture\ninvestments in certain of its properties, and,\nconsequently, its ability to control decisions\nrelating to such properties may be limited.\nProperty Risk. Real Estate Companies may be\nsubject to risks relating to functional\nobsolescence or reduced desirability of\nproperties; extended vacancies due to economic\nconditions and tenant bankruptcies;\ncatastrophic events such as earthquakes,\nhurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or\ncondemnation losses. Real estate income and\nvalues also may be greatly affected by\ndemographic trends, such as population shifts\nor changes in consumer preferences and values,\nor increasing vacancies or declining rents\nresulting from legal, cultural, technological,\nglobal or local economic developments.\nRegulatory Risk. Real estate income and values\nmay be adversely affected by such factors as\napplicable domestic and foreign laws\n(including tax laws). Government actions, such\nas tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other commercial restrictions or\nenvironmental regulations, also may have a\nmajor impact on real estate income and values.\nIn addition, quarterly compliance with\nregulations limiting the proportion of asset\ntypes held by a U.S. REIT may force certain\nReal Estate Companies to liquidate or\nrestructure otherwise attractive investments.\nSome countries may not recognize REITs or\ncomparable structures as a viable form of real\nestate funds. Underlying Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies make investments in a variety\nof debt and equity instruments with varying\nrisk profiles. For instance, Real Estate\nCompanies may invest in debt instruments\nsecured by commercial property that have\nhigher risks of delinquency and foreclosure\nthan loans on single family homes due to a\nvariety of factors associated with commercial\nproperty, including the tie between income\navailable to service debt and productive use\nof the property. Real Estate Companies may\nalso invest in debt instruments and preferred\nequity that are junior in an issuer\u2019s capital\nstructure and that involve privately\nnegotiated structures. Subordinated debt\ninvestments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine\nloans, involve a greater credit risk of\ndefault due to the need to service more senior\ndebt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred\nequity investments involve a greater risk of\nloss than conventional debt financing due to\ntheir non-collateralized nature and\nsubordinated ranking. Investments in\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities may also\nbe junior in priority in the event of\nbankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments\nin senior loans may be effectively\nsubordinated if the senior loan is pledged as\ncollateral. The ability of a holder of junior\nclaims to proceed against a defaulting issuer\nis circumscribed by the terms of the\nparticular contractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nA REIT that successfully maintains its\nqualification may still become subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes, including\nexcise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage\nrecording, and transfer taxes, both directly\nand indirectly through its subsidiaries.\nBecause REITs often do not provide complete\ntax information until after the calendar year-\nend, a Fund may at times need to request\npermission to extend the deadline for issuing\nyour tax reporting statement or supplement the\ninformation otherwise provided to you. Risk of\nInvesting in the Technology Sector. Technology\ncompanies are characterized by periodic new\nproduct introductions, innovations and\nevolving industry standards, and, as a result,\nface intense competition, both domestically\nand internationally, which may have an adverse\neffect on profit margins. Companies in the\ntechnology sector are often smaller and less\nexperienced companies and may be subject to\ngreater risks than larger companies; these\nrisks may be heightened for technology\ncompanies in foreign markets. Technology\ncompanies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel. The\nproducts of technology companies may face\nproduct obsolescence due to rapid\ntechnological\n\n30\n\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction, changes in consumer and business\npurchasing patterns, unpredictable changes in\ngrowth rates and competition for the services\nof qualified personnel. In addition, a rising\ninterest rate environment tends to negatively\naffect companies in the technology sector\nbecause, in such an environment, those\ncompanies with high market valuations may\nappear less attractive to investors, which may\ncause sharp decreases in the companies\u2019 market\nprices. Companies in the technology sector are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual\nproperty rights. The loss or impairment of\nthese rights may adversely affect the\nprofitability of these companies. Companies in\nthe technology sector are facing increased\ngovernment and regulatory scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or regulatory\naction. The technology sector may also be\nadversely affected by changes or trends in\ncommodity prices, which may be influenced or\ncharacterized by unpredictable factors.\nFinally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the technology sector may\nbe particular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nRisk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. The\nutilities sector may be adversely affected by\nchanging commodity prices, government\nregulation stipulating rates charged by\nutilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax\nlaws, interest rate fluctuations and changes\nin the cost of providing specific utility\nservices. The utilities industry is also\nsubject to potential terrorist attacks,\nnatural disasters and severe weather\nconditions, as well as regulatory and\noperational burdens associated with the\noperation and maintenance of nuclear\nfacilities. Government regulators monitor and\ncontrol utility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility profits. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate\nnuclear generating facilities. Governmental\nauthorities may from time to time review\nexisting policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policy For the Funds, the Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for each\nFund\u2019s securities to BFA pursuant to the\nFunds' Proxy Voting Policy, and BFA has\nadopted policies and procedures (collectively,\nthe \u201c iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d )\ngoverning proxy voting by accounts managed by\nBFA, including the Funds. Under the iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote\nproxies related to Fund securities in the best\ninterests of a Fund and its shareholders.The\nproxy voting policies that apply to the\niShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF\ninclude voting guidelines for corporate\ngovernance matters, as well as environmental\nand social issues, including providing\nframeworks of factors for consideration when\nBFA, on behalf of the Fund, votes on proposals\nrelated to such matters. BFA may not vote in\nfavor of any particular proposal related to\ncorporate governance, environmental or social\nissues. From time to time, a vote may present\na conflict between the interests of a Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, on the one hand, and those of\nBFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or\nBFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and\nprocedures that are designed to prevent undue\ninfluence on BFA\u2019s proxy voting activity that\nmight stem from any relationship between the\nissuer of a proxy (or any dissident\nshareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s affiliates, a Fund\nor a Fund\u2019s affiliates. Most conflicts are\nmanaged through a structural separation of\nBFA\u2019s Corporate Governance Group from BFA\u2019s\nemployees with sales and client\nresponsibilities. In addition, BFA\n\n31\n\nmaintains procedures to ensure that all\nengagements with corporate issuers or\ndissident shareholders are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BFA\u2019s\nrelationship with the issuer of the proxy or\nthe dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Funds' portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ended\nJune 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon\nrequest, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on\nits website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of a Fund\u2019s next net\nasset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: A Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of a Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to a Fund to settle\npurchases of a Fund ( i.e. Deposit Securities)\nor that Authorized Participants would receive\nfrom a Fund to settle redemptions of a Fund (\ni.e. Fund Securities). These files are known\nas the Portfolio Composition File and the Fund\nData File (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The\nFiles are applicable for the next trading day\nand are provided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an Authorized Participant or liquidity\nprovider the securities a Fund is willing to\naccept for a creation, and securities that a\nFund will provide on a redemption. BFA\nemployees may also discuss portfolio holdings-\nrelated information with broker/dealers, in\nconnection with settling a Fund\u2019s\ntransactions, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with the disclosure in the Fund's\ncurrent registration statement. \u2022\nCommunications with Listing Exchanges: From\ntime to time, employees of BFA may discuss\nportfolio holdings information with the\napplicable primary listing exchange for a Fund\nas needed to meet the exchange listing\nstandards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFunds, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Funds, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain a Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of a Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end\n\n32\n\nrequires a non-disclosure or confidentiality\nagreement and approval of the Trust\u2019s Chief\nCompliance Officer. Portfolio-level liquidity\nmetrics disclosure subsequent to 60 calendar\ndays after calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nConstruction and Maintenance of the Underlying\nIndexes Descriptions of the Underlying Indexes\nare provided below. With respect to certain\nunderlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA\nor its affiliates have held discussions with\nthe applicable index provider regarding their\nbusiness interest in licensing an index to\ntrack a particular market segment and conveyed\ninvestment concepts and strategies that could\nbe considered for the index. The index\nprovider designed and constituted such indices\nusing concepts conveyed by BFA or its\naffiliates. For certain of these indices, the\nrelevant fund may be the first or sole user of\nthe underlying index. In its sole discretion,\nthe index provider determines the composition\nof the securities and other instruments in\nsuch underlying index, the rebalance protocols\nof the underlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and other instruments in the\nunderlying index, and any updates to the\nmethodology. From time to time, BFA or its\naffiliates may also provide input relating to\npossible methodology changes of such\nunderlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\nThe Morningstar Index Morningstar \u00ae Global\nFood Innovation Index Number of Components:\napproximately 37 Index Description. The\nMorningstar Global Food Innovation Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of stocks\nissued by U.S. and non-U.S. companies that are\nexpected to benefit from creating or using\nagricultural technologies or innovative food\nproducts or services, as determined by\nMorningstar Indexes or its affiliates ( \u201c\nMorningstar \u201d ). The Underlying Index is a\nsubset of the Morningstar Global Markets\nIndex. Morningstar evaluates the constituents\nbased on five-year net profit and revenue\nprojections as a producer or supplier with\nrespect to four themes: \u2022 Agriculture\nTechnology: Solutions that enhance yield,\nimprove efficiency or achieve waste reduction.\nBusiness activities may include seeds, yield\nenhancement, automation, precision\nagriculture, digital agriculture,\nenvironmentally friendly agricultural inputs\nand animal genetics. \u2022 Alternative Proteins:\nFood, beverages or ingredients offering\nprotein sourced from non-animal origins.\nBusiness activities may include plant-based\nmeat, plant-based dairy, lab-cultured meat,\ninsect-based proteins and mycoproteins. \u2022\nNutritional Innovation and Safety:\nTechnologies that reduce preventable\nnutrition-related death or disease via\ninnovation or food safety practices. Business\nactivities may include nutrigenomics, brain-\nbody hunger impulse regulation, allergen-free\nnutrition, food scanners, zoonotic disease\nmitigation, food safety, diet tracking, and\nshelf- life extension. \u2022 Sustainable Food\nProduction and Packaging: Sustainable food\nproduction practices or sustainable packaging\nsolutions for food and beverages. Business\nactivities may include regenerative\nagriculture, organic farming, vertical or\nrooftop farms, land-based aquaculture,\nbiodiverse ocean farming and food waste\nreduction. Index Methodology . Securities from\nthe Morningstar Global Markets Index are\neligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index\nbased on the following criteria: \u2022 Securities\nmust have at least $2 million in three-month\naverage daily trading volume ( \u201c ADTV \u201d ) and\nat least a $300 million free float market\ncapitalization. Current index constituents are\neliminated if they have less than $1.5 million\nin three-month ADTV or less than $200 million\nfree float market capitalization.\n\n33\n\n\u2022 The issuer must be classified by Morningstar\nas a producer of goods or services related to\na theme of the Underlying Index or a supplier\nof such producers. \u2022 The issuer must have\ncurrent revenues from at least one theme and,\nas determined by Morningstar, must be highly\nlikely to experience at least a 5% increase in\nnet profit in aggregate from exposure to at\nleast one theme over the next five years.\nMorningstar research analysts estimate the\npercentage of total revenue that a company\nwill derive over the next five years from its\nexposure to each theme of the Underlying\nIndex. In making these projections, the\nresearch analysts may take into account, among\nother things, financial statements, historical\ngrowth rates, competitive and industry\nanalyses, macroeconomic factors, and news and\nother data sources. Based on the analysts\u2019\nrevenue projections, each company is assigned\nan \u201c exposure score \u201d for each theme as\nfollows: \u2022 Score of 0: Less than 10% of the\nissuer\u2019s total revenue \u2022 Score of 1: 10-25% of\nthe issuer\u2019s total revenue \u2022 Score of 2:\nGreater than 25-50% of the issuer\u2019s total\nrevenue \u2022 Score of 3: Greater than 50% of the\ntotal revenue of an issuer that is a supplier\n\u2022 Score of 4: Greater than 50% of the total\nrevenue of an issuer that is a producer A\nMorningstar committee reviews the scores\nassigned by analysts to help ensure internal\nconsistency. If a company has an exposure\nscore of zero for each theme, it is excluded\nfrom the Underlying Index. The remaining\npotential constituents are designated as Tier\n1 or Tier 2 based on their exposure scores.\nTier 1 issuers are those with (i) a score of 3\nor 4 in any theme; or (ii) an aggregate score\n(the sum of all exposure scores) of 5 or more;\nor (iii) a score of 2 in each of at least two\nthemes. Tier 2 includes all qualifying issuers\nthat are not in Tier 1. Morningstar then ranks\nthe potential constituents and makes\nselections for the Underlying Index according\nto the following criteria: \u2022 Preference for\nTier 1 constituents over Tier 2 \u2022 Higher\naggregate exposure score \u2022 Number of themes in\nwhich a constituent scores 4 \u2022 Number of\nthemes in which a constituent scores 3 \u2022\nNumber of themes in which a constituent scores\n2 \u2022 Number of themes in which a constituent\nscores 1 \u2022 Preference for current constituents\n\u2022 Preference for smaller float market\ncapitalization If there are 50 or more Tier 1\nconstituents, then all Tier 1 constituents are\nselected for the Underlying Index. However, if\nthere are fewer than 50 Tier 1 constituents,\nthe shortfall is filled with Tier 2\nconstituents, and the Underlying Index is\ncapped at 50 constituents. Constituents are\nfloat market capitalization-weighted with a 4%\ncap for individual stocks. The Underlying\nIndex is reconstituted and rebalanced each\nDecember. The themes are reviewed annually by\nMorningstar and are subject to change as they\nevolve and new themes emerge. Morningstar\u2019s\nmethodology does not require that at least one\ncompany from each of the themes be included in\nthe Underlying Index, nor does it require a\nminimum number of Tier 1 constituents. In\naddition, constituents may operate business\nlines that generate revenues in industries\nother than those related to the four themes.\nCalculation Methodology . The Fund utilizes\nthe Underlying Index calculated with net\ndividends reinvested. Morningstar uses the\ncountry of incorporation of the constituents\nto determine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents.\n\n34\n\nThe MSCI Indexes The MSCI indexes were founded\nin 1969 by Capital International S.A. as\ninternational performance benchmarks\nconstructed to facilitate comparison of world\nmarkets. The MSCI single country standard\nequity indexes have covered the world's\ndeveloped markets since 1969 and in 1987 MSCI\ncommenced coverage of emerging markets. Local\nstock exchanges traditionally calculated their\nown indexes, which were generally not\ncomparable with one another due to differences\nin the representation of the local market,\nmathematical formulas, base dates and methods\nof adjusting for capital changes. MSCI,\nhowever, applies the same calculation\nmethodology to all markets for all single\ncountry standard equity indexes, both\ndeveloped and emerging. MSCI Global Investable\nMarket Indexes MSCI's Global Investable Market\nIndexes (the \u201c MSCI GIMI \u201d ) provide coverage\nand non-overlapping market segmentation by\nmarket capitalization size and by style. The\nMSCI GIMI intend to target approximately 99%\ncoverage of the free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization in each market of large-, mid-\nand small-cap securities. In each market, MSCI\ncreates an Investable Market Index, Standard\nIndex, Large Cap Index, Mid Cap Index and\nSmall Cap Index. The Standard Index, Large Cap\nIndex, Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index are\neach subsets of the Investable Market Index\nfor a market. The MSCI Global Standard Index\nis the aggregation of the Large Cap Index and\nMid Cap Index and the MSCI GIMI is the\naggregation of the MSCI Global Standard Index\nand MSCI Global Small Cap Index. Selection\nCriteria. MSCI's index construction process\ninvolves: (i) defining the equity universe;\n(ii) determining the market investable equity\nuniverse for each market; (iii) determining\nmarket capitalization size segments for each\nmarket; (iv) applying final size segment\ninvestability requirements; and (v) applying\nindex continuity rules for the MSCI Global\nStandard Index. Defining the Equity Universe .\nMSCI begins with securities listed in\ncountries in the MSCI GIMI. As of June 8,\n2023, 23 are classified as developed markets,\n24 as emerging markets, and 21 as frontier\nmarkets (frontier markets exclude the West\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Union, which\nconsists of securities classified in Benin,\nBurkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau,\nMali, Niger, Senegal and Togo). All listed\nequity securities and listed securities that\nexhibit characteristics of equity securities,\nexcept mutual funds, ETFs, equity derivatives,\nlimited partnerships and most investment\ntrusts, are eligible for inclusion in the\nequity universe. REITs in some countries and\ncertain income trusts in Canada are also\neligible for inclusion. Each company and its\nsecurities ( i.e ., share classes) are\nclassified in only one country. Determining\nthe Market Investable Equity Universe for Each\nMarket. The equity universe in any market is\nderived by applying investability screens to\nindividual companies and securities in that\nmarket. Some investability requirements are\napplied at the individual security level and\nsome at the overall company level, represented\nby the aggregation of individual securities of\nthe company. As a result, the inclusion or\nexclusion of one security does not imply the\nautomatic inclusion or exclusion of other\nsecurities of the same company. Determining\nMarket Capitalization Size Segments for Each\nMarket. In order to create size components\nthat can be meaningfully aggregated into\ncomposites, individual market size segments\nbalance the following two objectives: \u2022\nAchieving global size integrity by ensuring\nthat companies of comparable and relevant\nsizes are included in a given size segment\nacross all markets in a composite index; and \u2022\nAchieving consistent market coverage by\nensuring that each market's size segment is\nrepresented in its proportional weight in the\ncomposite universe. The Standard Indexes,\nLarge Cap Indexes, Mid Cap Indexes, and Small\nCap Indexes capture the following market\ncapitalization size segments: \u2022 MSCI Global\nStandard Indexes cover all investable large-\nand mid-cap securities by including the\nlargest issuers comprising approximately 85%\nof each market\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. \u2022 MSCI Global Large Cap\nIndexes provide coverage of all investable\nlarge-cap securities by including the largest\nissuers comprising approximately 70% of each\nmarket\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. \u2022 MSCI Global Mid Cap Indexes\nprovide coverage in each market by deriving\nthe difference between the market coverage of\nthe MSCI Global Standard Index and the MSCI\nGlobal Large Cap Index in that market.\n\n35\n\n\u2022 MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes provide\ncoverage of companies with a market\ncapitalization below that of the companies in\nthe MSCI Global Standard Indexes. Applying\nFinal Size Segment Investability Requirements.\nIn order to enhance replicability of the\nindexes, additional size segment investability\nrequirements are set for the MSCI GIMI and\nMSCI Global Standard Index. These\ninvestability requirements include minimum\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization,\nminimum liquidity, minimum foreign limits and\nminimum length of trading. Applying Index\nContinuity Rules for the Standard Index. In\norder to achieve index continuity as well as\nprovide some basic level of diversification\nwithin a market index, notwithstanding the\neffect of other index construction rules\ncontained herein, a minimum number of five\nconstituents will be maintained for a\ndeveloped market Standard Index and a minimum\nnumber of three constituents will be\nmaintained for an emerging market Standard\nIndex. Weighting. All indexes of the MSCI GIMI\nare free float weighted, i.e., companies are\nincluded in the indexes at the value of their\nfree public float (free float multiplied by\nsecurity price). Regional Weights. Market\ncapitalization-weighting, combined with a\nconsistent target of approximately 99% of free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization, helps\nensure that each country's weight in regional\nand international indexes approximates its\nweight in the total universe of developing and\nemerging markets. A market is equivalent to a\nsingle country except for developed Europe,\nwhere all markets are aggregated into a single\nmarket for index construction purposes.\nIndividual country indexes of the European\ndeveloped markets are derived from the\nconstituents of the MSCI GIMI Europe Index.\nFree Float. MSCI defines the free float of a\nsecurity as the proportion of shares\noutstanding that are deemed to be available\nfor purchase in the public equity markets by\ninternational investors. In practice,\nlimitations on free float available to\ninternational investors include: (i) strategic\nand other shareholdings not considered part of\navailable free float; and (ii) limits on share\nownership for foreigners. MSCI calculates the\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization of\neach security in the equity index universe by\n(i) defining and estimating the free float\navailable to foreign investors; (ii) assigning\na free float-adjustment factor to each\nsecurity; and (iii) calculating the free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of each\nsecurity. Under MSCI's free float-adjustment\nmethodology, a constituent's inclusion factor\nis equal to its estimated free float, rounded\nup to the closest 5% for constituents with\nfree float equal to or exceeding 15%. For\nexample, a constituent security with a free\nfloat of 23.2% will be included in the index\nat 25% of its market capitalization. For\nsecurities with a free float of less than 15%,\nthe estimated free float is adjusted to the\nnearest 1%. Price and Exchange Rates Prices.\nThe prices used to calculate all MSCI indexes\nare the official exchange closing prices or\nthose figures accepted as such. MSCI reserves\nthe right to use an alternative pricing source\non any given day. Exchange Rates. MSCI uses\nthe World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates\ntaken at 4:00 p.m. London time. In case World\nMarkets/Reuters does not provide rates for\nspecific markets on given days (for example,\nChristmas Day and New Year's Day), the\nprevious business day's rates are normally\nused. MSCI independently monitors the exchange\nrates on all its indexes. MSCI may under\nexceptional circumstances elect to use\nalternative sources of exchange rates if the\nWorld Markets/Reuters rates are not available,\nor if MSCI determines that the World\nMarkets/Reuters rates are not reflective of\nmarket circumstances for a given currency on a\nparticular day. In such circumstances, an\nannouncement would be sent to clients with the\nrelated information. If appropriate, MSCI may\nconduct a consultation with the investment\ncommunity to gather feedback on the most\nrelevant exchange rate. Changes to the\nIndexes. The MSCI GIMI are maintained with the\nobjective of reflecting, on a timely basis,\nthe evolution of the underlying equity\nmarkets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes,\nemphasis is also placed on continuity,\nreplicability and minimizing turnover in the\nindexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves\nmany aspects, including: (i) additions to, and\ndeletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in\nnumber of shares; and (iii) changes in\ninclusion factors as a result of updated free\nfloat estimates. Index maintenance can be\ndescribed by three broad categories of\nchanges:\n\n36\n\n\u2022 Semi-Annual Index Reviews ( \u201c SAIRs \u201d ),\nconducted on a fixed semi-annual timetable\nthat systematically reassess the various\ndimensions of the equity universe for all\nmarkets; \u2022 Quarterly Index Reviews ( \u201c QIRs \u201d\n), aimed at promptly reflecting other\nsignificant market events; and \u2022 Ongoing\nevent-related changes, such as mergers,\nacquisitions, spin-offs, bankruptcies,\nreorganizations and other similar corporate\nevents, which generally are implemented in the\nindexes as they occur. Potential changes in\nthe status of countries (stand-alone,\nfrontier, emerging and developed) follow their\nown implementation time tables. In addition,\nreviews of company involvement in ESG\ncontroversies, when applicable, may differ by\nindex and severity of the ESG controversy as\ndetermined by MSCI. MSCI conducts SAIRs\ngenerally as of the close of the last business\nday of May and November. During the SAIRs,\nMSCI updates the investable equity universe\nand reassesses size segmentation investability\nrequirements. MSCI also conducts QIRs\ngenerally as of the close of the last business\nday of February and August. During the QIRs,\nMSCI reflects changes in the index that were\nnot captured at the time of their actual\noccurrence, but are significant enough to be\nincluded before the next SAIR. The results of\nthe SAIR and QIR are generally announced at\nleast ten business days in advance of\nimplementation. Creation of Sector and\nIndustry Indexes using the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) All\nsecurities in the Global Investable Equity\nUniverse are assigned to the industry that\nbest describes their business activities using\nthe GICS. The GICS consists of sectors,\nindustry groups, industries and sub-\nindustries. Under the GICS, each company is\nassigned to one unique sub-industry according\nto its principal business activity (generally\ndefined as the business activity that\ngenerates 60% or more of the company\u2019s\nrevenues). Narrower indexes may be derived\nbased on industry classification, and may\ncontain securities belonging to specific\nsectors, industry groups, industries, sub-\nindustries or a combination thereof. MSCI\n25/50 Indexes Each of the MSCI 25/50 Indexes\n(the \u201c 25/50 Indexes \u201d ) is a sub-index of\neither an MSCI Global Standard Index or an\nMSCI GIMI. Their construction reflects the\ndiversification requirements applicable to\nRICs pursuant to Subchapter M of the Internal\nRevenue Code. MSCI uses the concept of \u201c group\nentities \u201d for the concentration limits of the\ncapping methodologies in the 25/50 Indexes. A\ngroup entity is a group of companies that\noperate as an affiliated corporate group but\nmay separately issue listed securities. To\ndetermine \u201c group entities, \u201d MSCI analyzes\nfinancial accounts of listed companies holding\nstakes of 20% or more in other listed\ncompanies to determine whether these stakes\nare controlling in nature. In certain cases,\neven in the absence of consolidated accounts,\nMSCI may also consider two companies as\nbelonging to the same group entity where there\nis reasonable evidence of control based on\nother information. The 25/50 Indexes are free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization-weighted\nindexes with a capping methodology applied to\ngroup entity weights so that no single group\nentity exceeds 25% of index weight, and all\ngroup entities with a weight above 5% do not\ncumulatively exceed 50% of the index weight. A\nbuffer of 10% of the value of each of these\ncaps is used in order to reduce the risk of\nnoncompliance due to short term market\nmovements between rebalances. As a result, at\nthe point of constructing or rebalancing the\n25/50 Indexes, the weight of any single group\nentity cannot exceed 22.5% of the index weight\nand all group entities with weight above 4.5%\ncannot exceed 45% of the index weight. A\nsoftware application called the Barra\nOptimizer is utilized to calculate the capped\nindex weights through an optimization function\nwhich is aimed at minimizing index turnover,\ntracking error and extreme deviation from the\nuncapped index. MSCI All Ireland Capped Index\nNumber of Components: approximately 25 Index\nDescription. The MSCI All Ireland Capped Index\nis a free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization-weighted index that aims to\nreflect the performance of securities of\ncompanies that: (i) are classified in Ireland\naccording to the MSCI Global Investable Market\nIndex Methodology; (ii) are not classified in\nIreland according to the MSCI Global\nInvestable Market Index Methodology but are\neither headquartered or listed in Ireland and\ncarry out the majority of their operations in\nIreland, as defined by MSCI; or (iii) have\neconomic exposure greater than 10% to Ireland,\nas defined by MSCI, where the criteria\noutlined in (i) and (ii) do not result in the\ntarget number of securities and issuers. The\nIndex Provider generally applies a capping\nmethodology to the Underlying Index so that no\nsingle issuer exceeds 25% of the Underlying\nIndex weight, and all issuers with a weight\nabove 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the\nUnderlying Index weight. However, this capping\nmethodology does not apply to constituents\nthat (1) are not classified as a Large, Mid or\nSmall-Capitalization securities as per the\nMSCI Global Investment Market Index\nMethodology and either (2) have a 3-month\nannual traded value ratio\n\n37\n\n( \u201c ATVR \u201d ) less than or equal to 20% or (3)\nhave a market capitalization lower than the\nsize-segment cutoff of the MSCI Ireland IMI.\nATVR is a measure of traded value in a\nsecurity as a proportion of its free float-\nadjusted market capitalization. Constituents\nthat meet the first criteria, along with\neither the second or the third criteria, are\nrepresented at their weight in the MSCI All\nIreland Index. Calculation Methodology. The\nFund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated\nwith net dividends reinvested. MSCI uses the\nindex constituent companies\u2019 country of\nincorporation to determine the relevant\ndividend withholding tax rates in calculating\nthe net dividends. The regular cash dividend\nis reinvested after deduction of withholding\ntax by applying the maximum rate of the\ncompany\u2019s country of incorporation applicable\nto institutional investors. Net dividends\nmeans dividends after taxes withheld at the\nrate applicable to non-resident institutional\ninvestors who do not benefit from double\ntaxation treaties. Such withholding rates may\ndiffer from those applicable to U.S.\nresidents. MSCI Denmark IMI 25/50 Index Number\nof Components: approximately 48 Index\nDescription. The MSCI Denmark IMI 25/50 Index\nis designed to measure the performance of the\nlarge-, mid- and small-capitalization segments\nof the equity market in Denmark. The\nUnderlying Index is rebalanced quarterly using\nan optimization process that aims to minimize\nthe constituent weight differences between the\nUnderlying Index and the MSCI Denmark Index.\nThe Underlying Index uses a capping\nmethodology that limits the weight of any\nsingle \u201c group entity \u201d (constituents that\nMSCI determines have a control relationship)\nto a maximum of 25% of the Underlying Index\nweight, and the sum of all group entities with\na weight above 5% to an aggregate of 50% of\nthe Underlying Index weight. A group entity is\na group of companies that operate as an\naffiliated corporate group but may separately\nissue listed securities. To determine \u201c group\nentities, \u201d MSCI analyzes financial accounts\nof listed companies holding stakes of 20% or\nmore in other listed companies to determine\nwhether these stakes are controlling in\nnature. In certain cases, even in the absence\nof consolidated accounts, MSCI may also\nconsider two companies as belonging to the\nsame group entity where there is reasonable\nevidence of control based on other\ninformation. All group entities are reviewed\non an annual basis. Calculation Methodology.\nThe Fund utilizes the Underlying Index\ncalculated with net dividends reinvested. MSCI\nuses the index constituent companies\u2019 country\nof incorporation to determine the relevant\ndividend withholding tax rates in calculating\nthe net dividends. The regular cash dividend\nis reinvested after deduction of withholding\ntax by applying the maximum rate of the\ncompany\u2019s country of incorporation applicable\nto institutional investors. Net dividends\nmeans dividends after taxes withheld at the\nrate applicable to non-resident institutional\ninvestors who do not benefit from double\ntaxation treaties. Such withholding rates may\ndiffer from those applicable to U.S.\nresidents. MSCI EAFE Choice ESG Screened Index\nNumber of Components: approximately 548 Index\nDescription. The MSCI EAFE Choice ESG Screened\nIndex is a free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization-weighted index that is designed\nto reflect the equity performance of large-\nand mid-capitalization developed market\ncompanies, excluding the U.S. and Canada, with\nfavorable environmental, social and governance\n( \u201c ESG \u201d ) ratings (as determined by MSCI ESG\nResearch LLC) while applying extensive\nscreens, including a focus on removing fossil\nfuel exposure.

Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. MSCI EAFE\nExtended ESG Focus Index Number of Components:\napproximately 408 Index Description. The MSCI\nEAFE Extended ESG Focus Index is an optimized\nindex that is designed to reflect the equity\nperformance of developed market companies\n(excluding the U.S. and Canada)that have\nfavorable ESG characteristics, which exhibit\nrisk and return characteristics similar to the\nMSCI EAFE Index. The index is constructed by\nselecting constituents from the MSCI EAFE\nIndex, the parent index, through an\noptimization process that aims to maximize\nexposure to ESG factors, subject to a target\ntracking error constraint of 50 basis points\nrelative to the parent index. The Fund\u2019s Index\nProvider begins with the parent index and\nexcludes securities of companies involved in\nthe business of tobacco, companies involved\nwith controversial weapons, producers and\nretailers of civilian firearms, and companies\ninvolved in certain fossil fuels-related\nactivity such as the production of thermal\ncoal, thermal coal-based power generation and\nextraction of oil sands based on revenue or\npercentage of revenue thresholds for certain\ncategories ( e.g., $20 million or 5%) and\ncategorical exclusions for others ( e.g.,\ncontroversial weapons). The Index Provider\nalso excludes companies involved in very\nsevere business controversies (in each case as\ndetermined by the Index Provider), and then\nfollows a quantitative process that is\ndesigned to determine optimal weights for\nsecurities to maximize exposure to securities\nof companies with higher ESG ratings, subject\nto maintaining risk and return characteristics\nsimilar to the parent index. For each\nindustry, the Index Provider identifies key\nESG issues that can lead to unexpected costs\nfor companies in the medium to long term. The\nIndex Provider then calculates the size of\neach company\u2019s exposure to each key issue\nbased on the company\u2019s business segment and\ngeographic risk and analyzes the extent to\nwhich companies have developed robust\nstrategies and programs to manage ESG risks\nand opportunities. Using a sector-specific key\nissue weighting model, companies are rated and\nranked in comparison to their industry peers.\nCalculation Methodology. The Fund utilizes the\nUnderlying Index calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. MSCI Finland IMI\n25/50 Index Number of Components:\napproximately 40 Index Description. The MSCI\nFinland IMI 25/50 Index is designed to measure\nthe performance of the large-, mid- and small-\ncapitalization segments of the equity market\nin Finland. The Underlying Index is rebalanced\nquarterly using an optimization process that\naims to minimize the constituent weight\ndifferences between the Underlying Index and\nthe MSCI Finland Index. The Underlying Index\nuses a capping methodology that limits the\nweight of any single \u201c group entity \u201d\n(constituents that MSCI determines have a\ncontrol relationship) to a maximum of 25% of\nthe Underlying Index weight, and the sum of\nall group entities with a weight above 5% to\nan aggregate of 50% of the Underlying Index\nweight. A group entity is a group of companies\nthat operate as an affiliated corporate group\nbut may separately issue listed securities. To\ndetermine \u201c group entities, \u201d MSCI analyzes\nfinancial accounts of listed companies holding\nstakes of 20% or more in other listed\ncompanies to determine whether these stakes\nare controlling in nature. In certain cases,\neven in the absence of consolidated accounts,\n\n40\n\nMSCI may also consider two companies as\nbelonging to the same group entity where there\nis reasonable evidence of control based on\nother information. All group entities are\nreviewed on an annual basis. Calculation\nMethodology. The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors.

The MSCI\nIndonesia IMI 25/50 Index is designed to\nmeasure the performance of the large-, mid-\nand small-capitalization segments of the\nequity market in Indonesia. The Underlying\nIndex is a free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization-weighted index with a capping\nmethodology applied to issuer weights so that\nno single issuer exceeds 25% of the Underlying\nIndex weight and all issuers with a weight\nabove 5% do not, in the aggregate, exceed 50%\nof the Underlying Index weight. The Underlying\nIndex covers approximately 99% of the free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization in\nIndonesia. Calculation Methodology. The Fund\nutilizes the Underlying Index calculated with\nnet dividends reinvested. MSCI uses the index\nconstituent companies\u2019 country of\nincorporation to determine the relevant\ndividend withholding tax rates in calculating\nthe net dividends. The regular cash dividend\nis reinvested after deduction of withholding\ntax by applying the maximum rate of the\ncompany\u2019s country of incorporation applicable\nto institutional investors. Net dividends\nmeans dividends after taxes withheld at the\nrate applicable to non-resident institutional\ninvestors who do not benefit from double\ntaxation treaties. Such withholding rates may\ndiffer from those applicable to U.S.\nresidents. MSCI Japan Value Index (USD) Number\nof Components: approximately 142 Index\nDescription. The MSCI Japan Value Index is a\nsubset of the MSCI Japan Index. The Underlying\nIndex targets approximately 50% coverage of\nthe free float-adjusted market capitalization\nof the MSCI Japan Index and consists of\nsecurities that generally tend to have higher\nvalue characteristics i.e. higher book value\nto price ratio, 12-month forward earnings to\nprice ratio and dividend yield. Each security\nis evaluated based on certain value factors\nand growth factors, which are then used to\ncalculate a growth score and value score.\nBased upon these two scores, MSCI determines\nthe extent to which each security is assigned\nto the value or growth style. It is possible\nfor a single security to have representation\nin both the value and growth style indexes;\nhowever, no more than 100% of a security\u2019s\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization will be\nincluded within the combined style framework.\nCalculation Methodology. The Fund utilizes the\nUnderlying Index calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. MSCI New Zealand\nAll Cap Top 25 Capped Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 25 Index\nDescription. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the MSCI New Zealand All\nCap Top 25 Capped Index. The Underlying Index\nis a subset of the MSCI New Zealand All Cap\nIndex (the \u201c Parent Index \u201d ), which comprises\nall large-, mid-, small-, and micro-\ncapitalization stocks listed in New Zealand.\nThe Underlying Index is a free float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization weighted index that\nincludes the 25 largest constituents in the\nParent Index and is constrained such that no\nsingle \u201c group entity \u201d exceeds 25% of the\nUnderlying Index weight and the sum of all\ngroup entities with a weight above 5% does not\nexceed an aggregate of 50% of the Underlying\nIndex weight, as determined by MSCI Inc. ( \u201c\nMSCI \u201d ). The Underlying Index also implements\na buffer of 10% of the value of each\nconstraint, such that the weight of any single\ngroup entity cannot\n\n41\n\nexceed 22.5% of the Underlying Index weight\nand all group entities with a weight above\n4.5% cannot exceed 45% of the Underlying Index\nweight. MSCI defines a group entity as a group\nof companies that operate as an affiliated\ncorporate group but may separately issue\nlisted securities. To determine whether\nconstituents are \u201c group entities, \u201d MSCI\nanalyzes the financial accounts of listed\ncompanies holding stakes of 20% or more in\nother listed companies to identify whether\nthese stakes are controlling in nature and,\nconsequently, whether both companies should be\nconsidered as belonging to the same group\nentity. In certain cases, even in the absence\nof consolidated accounts, MSCI may also\nconsider two companies as belonging to the\nsame group entity where there is reasonable\nevidence of control based on other\ninformation. All group entities are reviewed\non an annual basis, though any change in a\ngroup entity resulting from a corporate event\n( e.g. , spin offs) or public disclosure will\nbe implemented at the time of the event or as\nof the close of the last business day of the\nmonth, respectively. The Underlying Index is\nrebalanced on a quarterly basis. Calculation\nMethodology. The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors.

Such withholding rates may\ndiffer from those applicable to U.S.\nresidents. MSCI United Kingdom Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 82 Index\nDescription. The MSCI United Kingdom Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of the\nlarge- and mid-capitalization segments of the\nU.K. market. Calculation Methodology. The Fund\nutilizes the Underlying Index calculated with\nnet dividends reinvested. MSCI uses the index\nconstituent companies\u2019 country of\nincorporation to determine the relevant\ndividend withholding tax rates in calculating\nthe net dividends. The regular cash dividend\nis reinvested after deduction of withholding\ntax by applying the maximum rate of the\ncompany\u2019s country of incorporation applicable\nto institutional investors. Net dividends\nmeans dividends after taxes withheld at the\nrate applicable to non-resident institutional\ninvestors who do not benefit from double\ntaxation treaties. Such withholding rates may\ndiffer from those applicable to U.S.\nresidents. MSCI United Kingdom Small Cap Index\nNumber of Components: approximately 247 Index\nDescription. The MSCI United Kingdom Small Cap\nIndex is a free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization-weighted index that is designed\nto measure the performance of equity\nsecurities of small capitalization companies\nin the U.K. securities market. Free-float\nmarket capitalization is calculated by taking\nthe security's price and multiplying it by the\nnumber of shares readily available in the\nmarket rather than the total number of shares\noutstanding.\n\n43\n\nCalculation Methodology. The Fund utilizes the\nUnderlying Index calculated with net dividends\nreinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent\ncompanies\u2019 country of incorporation to\ndetermine the relevant dividend withholding\ntax rates in calculating the net dividends.\nThe regular cash dividend is reinvested after\ndeduction of withholding tax by applying the\nmaximum rate of the company\u2019s country of\nincorporation applicable to institutional\ninvestors. Net dividends means dividends after\ntaxes withheld at the rate applicable to non-\nresident institutional investors who do not\nbenefit from double taxation treaties. Such\nwithholding rates may differ from those\napplicable to U.S. residents. MSCI USA Choice\nESG Screened Index Number of Components:\napproximately 381 Index Description. The MSCI\nUSA Choice ESG Screened Index is a free float-\nadjusted market capitalization-weighted index\nthat is designed to reflect the equity\nperformance of large- and mid-capitalization\nU.S. companies with favorable ESG ratings (as\ndetermined by MSCI ESG Research LLC) while\napplying extensive screens, including a focus\non removing fossil fuel exposure. MSCI begins\nwith the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and\nselects companies with favorable ESG ratings\nwhile excluding: \u2022 All companies that derive\n5% or more aggregate revenue from the\nproduction, distribution and retail, and all\ncompanies that produce, direct, or publish\nadult entertainment materials that fall into\nthe following categories: producer of X-rated\nfilms, pay-per-view programming or channels,\nsexually explicit video games, books or\nmagazines with adult content, live\nentertainment of an adult nature, and adults-\nonly material on the internet;

The Fund utilizes\nthe Underlying Index calculated with gross\ndividends reinvested. The use of gross\ndividends reflects the assumed reinvestment of\nthe entire dividend distributed to holders of\nthe underlying stock, without any adjustment\nfor taxes or withholding. The Underlying Index\nis rebalanced on a quarterly basis coinciding\nwith the regular Index Reviews of the MSCI\nGlobal Investable Market Indexes. MSCI USA\nClimate Paris Aligned Benchmark Extended\nSelect Index Number of Components:\napproximately 272 Index Description. The MSCI\nUSA Climate Paris Aligned Benchmark Extended\nSelect Index is an optimized equity index\ndesigned to reflect the performance\ncharacteristics of a subset of U.S. large- and\nmid-capitalization equity securities within\nthe MSCI USA Index. The components of the\nUnderlying Index are selected and weighted so\nthat, in the aggregate, the portfolio is\ncompatible with the objectives of the Paris\nAgreement by following a decarbonization\ntrajectory, reducing exposure to climate-\nrelated transition and physical risks and\nincreasing exposure to companies favorably\npositioned for the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. The Underlying Index aims to exceed\nthe minimum standards for a \u201c Paris-Aligned\nBenchmark \u201d ( \u201c PAB \u201d ) under the European\nUnion\u2019s Low Carbon Benchmark Regulation. PABs\nare designed to align with the principal\nobjective of the Paris Agreement, which is to\nlimit global warming in this century to well\nbelow 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5\ndegrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels.\nProviders of PABs must use the 1.5 degrees\nCelsius scenario (with no or limited\novershoot, i.e ., a temporary rise above 1.5\ndegrees Celsius) as the reference temperature\nscenario to design the index methodology. The\nIndex Provider begins with the MSCI USA Index\nand excludes the securities of issuers that it\nidentifies as being involved in any of the\nbusiness activities summarized below:\n\n45\n\n\u2022 Producing tobacco; deriving 5% or more\naggregate revenue from the production,\ndistribution, retail and supply of tobacco-\nrelated products; or owning at least 20% of,\nor being at least 50% owned by, a tobacco\ncompany. \u2022 Producing cluster bombs, landmines,\ndepleted uranium, chemical or biological\nweapons, blinding laser weapons, non-\ndetectable fragments or incendiary weapons;\nproducing key components of cluster bombs,\nlandmines, depleted uranium weapons, or\nchemical or biological weapons; owning 20% or\nmore (50% for financial companies) of a\nweapons or components producer; or being 50%\nor more owned by a company involved in weapons\nor components production. \u2022 Manufacturing of\nthe following, regardless of whether intended\nfor exclusive use in nuclear weapons: nuclear\nwarheads, whole nuclear missiles, nuclear\nweapon delivery systems or components, or\nproviding auxiliary services related to\nnuclear weapons. \u2022 Producing firearms or small\narms ammunitions for civilian markets or\nderiving 5% or more revenue, or $20 million or\nmore revenue, from the production or\ndistribution (wholesale or retail) of such\nfirearms or ammunition. \u2022 Deriving 1% or more\nrevenue from thermal coal mining or sales to\nexternal parties, but excluding all revenue\nfrom metallurgical coal, coal mined for\ninternal power generation, intra-company sales\nof mined thermal coal and coal trading. \u2022\nDeriving 10% or more revenue from oil- or gas-\nrelated activities, including distribution,\nequipment, production, transportation or\nrefining, but excluding biofuel production,\nsales and trading. \u2022 Deriving 50% or more\nrevenue from power generation based on thermal\ncoal, liquid fuel or natural gas. \u2022 Deriving\n5% or more revenue from oil sands extraction.\nThe Index Provider also excludes companies\nthat it determines are involved in ongoing and\n\u201c very severe \u201d controversies related to the\nESG impact of the company\u2019s actions, products\nor operations. The Index Provider defines a\ncontroversy as an instance or ongoing\nsituation in which company operations and/or\nproducts allegedly have a negative ESG impact,\nincluding alleged violations of laws,\nregulations or accepted international norms.\nTo evaluate ESG controversies, the Index\nProvider monitors across five categories of\nESG impact \u2013 environment, human rights and\ncommunities, labor rights and supply chain,\ncustomers and governance \u2013 and 28 sub-\ncategories. The Index Provider also excludes\ncompanies that are directly involved in\nongoing severe or very severe environmental\ncontroversies; companies that have settled\nmost but not all stakeholder concerns related\nto their direct involvement in very severe\nenvironmental controversies; and companies\nthat are indirectly involved in very severe\nenvironmental controversies, each as\ndetermined by the Index Provider.\nEnvironmental controversies can relate to,\namong other things, toxic emissions and waste,\nwater stress, biodiversity and supply chain\nmanagement. The Index Provider excludes\ncompanies that are not assessed by the Index\nProvider regarding ESG controversies or\nenvironmental harm. The Index Provider then\nrefines the set of remaining securities by\napplying a number of sustainability-related\nconstraints. In order to exceed the minimum\nstandards for PABs, the Index Provider targets\nthe following index-level constraints at each\nsemi-annual rebalancing: \u2022 at least a 50%\nreduction in greenhouse gas ( \u201c GHG \u201d )\nintensity compared with the MSCI USA Index,\ntaking into account issuers\u2019 Scope 1, 2 and 3\nemissions (i.e., direct emissions from sources\nthat an issuer owns or controls and indirect\nemissions from the purchase of energy and a\ncompany\u2019s value chain); \u2022 at least a 10% year-\nover-year reduction in the GHG intensity (or\ndecarbonization rate) of the Underlying Index\nitself; and \u2022 a level of exposure to sectors\nwith a high impact on climate change (i.e.,\nthose sectors that are key to the low carbon\ntransition) that is not less than the exposure\nin the MSCI USA Index, to ensure that such\nsectors are not underweighted in the\nUnderlying Index. In addition, each of the\nfollowing index-level constraints related to\nsustainability is applied in constructing the\nUnderlying Index and at each semi-annual\nrebalancing: \u2022 At least a 20% increase,\nrelative to the MSCI USA Index, in the\naggregate weight of companies that publish\nemissions reduction targets, that publish\ntheir annual emissions levels and that have\nreduced their GHG intensity by at least 7%\nover each of the last three years.\n\n46\n\n\u2022 At least a 50% reduction, relative to the\nMSCI USA Index, in overall weighted average\npotential carbon intensity, generally assessed\nbased on emissions that could be generated if\nthe proven and probable fossil fuel reserves\nowned by the companies in the portfolio were\nburned. For newly added index constituents\nwhere data is not yet available, the Index\nProvider uses zero fossil fuel reserves. \u2022 At\nleast a 50% reduction, relative to the MSCI\nUSA Index, in overall exposure to physical\nrisk arising from extreme weather events. \u2022 At\nleast a 10% increase, relative to the MSCI USA\nIndex, in the aggregate \u201c low carbon\ntransition \u201d ( \u201c LCT \u201d ) score, which at the\nconstituent level measures a company\u2019s\nexposure to and management of risks and\nopportunities related to the low carbon\ntransition. The target increase would result\nin a lower overall exposure to companies\nfacing transition-related risks and/or a\nhigher overall exposure to companies that may\nhave transition-related opportunities. \u2022 At\nleast a 100% increase, relative to the MSCI\nUSA Index, in overall exposure to \u201c green\nrevenue, \u201d defined as the cumulative revenue\nfrom alternative energy, energy efficiency,\nsustainable water, green building, pollution\nprevention and sustainable agriculture. \u2022 A\nratio of weighted average green revenue to\nweighted average \u201c brown revenue \u201d that is at\nleast four times that of the MSCI USA Index,\nwith \u201c brown revenue \u201d defined as revenue from\nthe mining of thermal coal or its sale to\nexternal parties; the extraction, production\nor refining of conventional and unconventional\noil and gas; and power on thermal coal, liquid\nfuel or natural gas. At each semi-annual index\nrebalancing, the Index Provider applies\nconstituent-level constraints that aim to\nensure replicability and investability,\nincluding the following: \u2022 an index\nconstituent\u2019s weight is restricted to the\nlower of +/- 2% or 20 times the constituent\u2019s\nweight in the MSCI USA Index; \u2022 an index\nconstituent\u2019s minimum weight is 0.01%; \u2022 the\nsector weights of the Underlying Index do not\ndeviate more than +/- 5% from those of the\nMSCI USA Index (except for the energy sector);\nand \u2022 the one-way turnover of the Underlying\nIndex is capped at 5%. Calculation\nMethodology. The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with gross dividends\nreinvested. The use of gross dividends\nreflects the assumed reinvestment of the\nentire dividend distributed to holders of the\nunderlying stock, without any adjustment for\ntaxes or withholding. The Underlying Index is\nrebalanced on a semi-annual basis, as of the\nclose of the last business day of May and\nNovember, coinciding with the May and November\nSemi-Annual Index Review of the MSCI Global\nInvestable Market Indexes. MSCI USA Extended\nClimate Action Index Number of Components:\napproximately 309 Index Description. The MSCI\nUSA Extended Climate Action Index is composed\nof U.S. large- and mid-capitalization\ncompanies based on their positioning, relative\nto their sector peers, with respect to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, as\ndetermined by MSCI. The Index Provider uses\ndata provided by MSCI ESG Research LLC and\nother sources to assess companies for\neligibility for inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex and to rank and select securities based\nprimarily on current emissions intensity,\nemissions reduction targets, green revenue,\nand/or climate risk management. The Underlying\nIndex seeks to reflect the overall sector\ncomposition of the MSCI USA Index (the \u201c\nparent index \u201d ) by including approximately\n50% of the companies from each Global Industry\nClassification Standard ( \u201c GICS \u201d ) sector in\nthe parent index. The parent index is a float-\nadjusted market capitalization weighted index\ndesigned to measure the performance of the\nlarge- and mid-capitalization companies in the\nU.S. market, irrespective of their climate\nimpact. As a result, the Underlying Index will\ninclude constituents from a broad range of\nsectors in the U.S. market, including sectors\nthat have more climate impact than other\nsectors. Index Methodology. The Index Provider\nbegins with the constituent universe of the\nparent index and applies several types of\nexclusionary screens, as described below.\n\n47\n\nThe Index Provider excludes the securities of\nissuers that it identifies as being involved\nin any of the business activities summarized\nbelow ( \u201c business involvement screens \u201d ): \u2022\nCompanies that are classified as a \u201c producer\n\u201d of tobacco and companies that derive 5% or\nmore aggregate revenue from the production,\ndistribution, retail, supply, and licensing of\ntobacco-related products. \u2022 Companies with any\ntie to controversial weapons, which are\ndefined by the Index Provider as cluster\nmunitions, landmines, biological and chemical\nweapons, depleted uranium weapons, blinding\nlaser weapons, incendiary weapons and non-\ndetectable fragments. \u2022 Companies deriving 1%\nor more revenue (reported or estimated) from\nthe mining of thermal coal (including lignite,\nbituminous, anthracite and steam coal) and its\nsale to external parties. It excludes revenue\nfrom metallurgical coal, coal mined for\ninternal power generation, intra-company sales\nof mined thermal coal, and revenue from coal\ntrading (reported or estimated). \u2022 Companies\nthat own oil sands reserves, disclose evidence\nof deriving revenue from oil sands extraction\nand derive 5% or more revenue from such\nextraction. Companies that derive revenue from\nnon-extraction activities ( e.g., exploration,\nsurveying, processing, refining) or intra-\ncompany sales are not excluded. Additionally,\ncompanies that own oil sands reserves with no\nassociated revenue are not excluded. \u2022\nCompanies that manufacture nuclear warheads\nand/or whole nuclear missiles, including\nassembly and integration of warhead and\nmissile body; companies with contracts to\noperate/manage government-owned facilities\nthat manufacture nuclear warheads and missiles\nor their components; companies that\nmanufacture components that were developed or\nare significantly modified for exclusive use\nin nuclear weapons; companies that manufacture\nor assemble delivery platforms that were\ndeveloped or significantly modified for the\nexclusive delivery of nuclear weapons;\ncompanies that provide auxiliary services\nrelated to nuclear weapons, such as repairing\nand maintaining nuclear weapons, providing\noverhaul and upgrade services, stockpiling and\nstewardship, R&D work, testing and\nsimulations; companies with contracts to\noperate/manage government-owned facilities\nthat conduct R&D, testing, simulations, and\nother essential sciences on nuclear weapons;\ncompanies that manufacture components that\nwere not developed or not significantly\nmodified for exclusive use in nuclear weapons\nbut that can be used in nuclear weapons;\ncompanies that manufacture or assemble\ndelivery platforms that were not developed or\nnot significantly modified for the exclusive\ndelivery of nuclear weapons but that have the\ncapability to deliver nuclear weapons; and\ncompanies that manufacture components for\nnuclear-exclusive delivery platforms. The\nIndex Provider also excludes companies that it\ndetermines are directly involved in ongoing, \u201c\nvery severe \u201d ESG controversies, defined as an\ninstance or ongoing situation in which company\noperations and/or products allegedly are\ndirectly implicated in having a negative ESG\nimpact, including alleged violations of laws,\nregulations, or accepted international norms (\ne.g., human rights violations or toxic\nemissions and waste). To evaluate ESG\ncontroversies, the Index Provider monitors\nacross five categories of ESG impact \u2013\nenvironment, human rights and communities,\nlabor rights and supply chain, customers and\ngovernance \u2013 and 28 sub-categories. The Index\nProvider also excludes companies that are not\nassessed by the Index Provider regarding ESG\ncontroversies. Another screen excludes issuers\nthat have high \u201c emissions intensity \u201d or high\n\u201c total potential carbon emissions, \u201d meaning\nthat the issuer is in the worst 5% of the MSCI\nACWI Index for the emissions metric, as\ndetermined by the Index Provider. However,\nhigh emitters are not excluded by this screen\nif they have emissions reduction targets that\nhave been approved by the Science-Based\nTargets initiative ( \u201c SBTi \u201d ). SBTi does not\nmonitor whether companies modify their targets\nor make progress toward the targets. \u201c\nEmissions intensity \u201d is defined by the Index\nProvider as Scope 1+2+3 global greenhouse gas\n( \u201c GHG \u201d ) emissions ( i.e., direct emissions\nfrom sources that an issuer owns or controls\nand indirect emissions from the purchase of\nenergy and a company\u2019s value chain) as a\npercentage of the issuer\u2019s enterprise value\nand cash. \u201c Total potential carbon emissions \u201d\nare the sum of the potential carbon emissions\nof the fossil fuel reserves, excluding\nmetallurgical coal reserves, owned by an\nissuer, and are calculated only for companies\nthat the Index Provider considers most likely\nto use their fossil fuel reserves for energy\napplications ( i.e., burned or combusted to\nproduce power or heat). Issuers without data\non their emissions intensity are excluded from\nthe Underlying Index. The Index Provider also\nexcludes issuers that are in the worst\nquartile of their GICS sector within the\nparent index based on their management of\nclimate change risks and opportunities ( \u201c\nclimate risk management \u201d ). The Index\nProvider assesses issuers according to their\nmanagement of one or more of the following\nfactors, to which it assigns security-specific\nweights: carbon emissions, product carbon\nfootprint, climate change vulnerability,\nbiodiversity and land use, and opportunities\nin clean tech, green building and renewable\nenergy.\n\n48\n\nEligible securities are then evaluated\naccording to a framework that assigns an\ninitial \u201c GHG Intensity Score, \u201d which\ncorresponds to the issuer\u2019s sector-relative\nquartile position within the parent index\nbased on its Scope 1+2+3 GHG intensity. The\nscore may be improved with a one-quartile or\ntwo-quartile adjustment based on an issuer\u2019s\nemissions reduction targets, emissions track\nrecord, green revenue or climate risk\nmanagement, each as described further below.\nThe final GHG Intensity Score, after any\nadjustment, is used for ranking and selecting\nsecurities for inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex. An issuer is credited with a two-\nquartile improvement in its GHG Intensity\nScore if the issuer either (i) has approved\nscience-based targets ( \u201c SBTs \u201d ) for\nemissions reduction or (ii) is assessed by the\nIndex Provider as having a \u201c credible track\nrecord \u201d of reduced emissions. Approved SBTs\nare targets that have been determined by SBTi\nto align with certain criteria set by SBTi\nbased on climate science. As noted above, SBTi\ndoes not monitor whether companies modify\ntheir targets or make progress toward the\ntargets. To be considered to have a credible\ntrack record of emissions reduction, an issuer\nmust meet the following criteria: (i) have\npublished emissions data; (ii) have a\npublished (not approved or validated)\nemissions reduction target; (iii) over the\npast four years, have an average yearly\nemissions reduction of at least 2%; and (iv)\nbe ranked in the best quartile of all sector\npeers in the parent index with an average 2%\nor greater yearly emissions reduction over the\npast four years. An issuer\u2019s average yearly\nemissions change is calculated as a geometric\naverage of the last three year-over-year\nchanges. Issuers with less than four years of\nemissions data are not evaluated on the\ncredible track record metric. For the\nremaining eligible securities, the GHG\nIntensity Score is improved by one quartile\nfor any issuer that is within the best\nquartile, on a sector-relative basis within\nthe parent index, for either (i) climate risk\nmanagement or (ii) \u201c green revenue, \u201d each as\ndetermined by the Index Provider. An issuer\nmust have at least 5% green revenue to receive\nthe improvement to its GHG Intensity Score. \u201c\nGreen revenue \u201d is defined as the cumulative\nrevenue percentage that a company derives from\nalternative energy, energy efficiency,\nsustainable water, green building, pollution\nprevention and sustainable agriculture.\nEligible securities of each GICS sector are\nsorted in ascending order of their final GHG\nIntensity Score (after any improvement) and\ndescending order of float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. For each sector, securities\nare selected from the top until the total\nnumber of selected securities (by count) is\napproximately 50% of the number of securities\nin that sector in the parent index. Any\nsecurities selected in this step that are\nproducers of civilian firearms or ammunition,\nas determined by the Index Provider, are\nremoved from the Underlying Index. The parent\nindex weights of the remaining selected\nsecurities are renormalized to 100%. Sector\nweights are limited to +/- 5% the weight of\nthat sector in the parent index, and\nindividual issuer weights are capped at 5% of\nthe Underlying Index. The Underlying Index is\nreconstituted and rebalanced in May and\nNovember. The business involvement and\nfirearms exclusionary screens are reviewed\nquarterly. The ESG controversy screen is\nreviewed monthly. Existing constituents that\nmeet the exclusion criteria are deleted from\nthe Underlying Index, and the weights of the\nremaining constituents are renormalized to\n100%. MSCI USA Extended ESG Focus Index Number\nof Components: approximately 300 Index\nDescription. The MSCI USA Extended ESG Focus\nIndex is designed to maximize exposure to\nfavorable ESG characteristics while exhibiting\nrisk and return characteristics similar to\nthose of the MSCI USA Index, the parent index.\nThe Underlying Index is constructed by\nselecting constituents from the parent index\nthrough an optimization process that aims to\nmaximize exposure to ESG factors for a target\ntracking error constraint of 50 basis points\nrelative to the parent index. The Fund\u2019s Index\nProvider begins with the parent index and\nexcludes securities of companies involved in\nthe business of tobacco, companies involved\nwith controversial weapons, producers and\nretailers of civilian firearms, and companies\ninvolved in certain fossil fuels-related\nactivity such as the production of thermal\ncoal, thermal coal-based power generation and\nextraction of oil sands based on revenue or\npercentage of revenue thresholds for certain\ncategories ( e.g., $20 million or 5%) and\ncategorical exclusions for others ( e.g.,\ncontroversial weapons). The Index Provider\nalso excludes companies involved in very\nsevere business controversies (in each case as\ndetermined by the Index Provider), and then\nfollows a quantitative process that is\ndesigned to determine optimal weights for\nsecurities to maximize exposure to securities\nof companies with higher ESG ratings, subject\nto maintaining risk and return characteristics\nsimilar to those of the parent index. For each\nindustry, the Index Provider identifies key\nESG issues that can lead to unexpected costs\nfor companies in the medium- to long-term. The\nIndex Provider then calculates the size of\neach company\u2019s exposure to each key issue\nbased on the company\u2019s\n\n49\n\nbusiness segment and geographic risk and\nanalyzes the extent to which companies have\ndeveloped robust strategies and programs to\nmanage ESG risks and opportunities. Using a\nsector-specific key issue weighting model,\ncompanies are rated and ranked in comparison\nto their industry peers. Calculation\nMethodology. The Fund utilizes the Underlying\nIndex calculated with gross dividends\nreinvested. The use of gross dividends\nreflects the assumed reinvestment of the\nentire dividend distributed to holders of the\nunderlying stock, without any adjustment for\ntaxes or withholding. The Underlying Index is\nrebalanced on a quarterly basis coinciding\nwith the regular Index Reviews of the MSCI\nGlobal Investable Market Indexes. MSCI USA\nExtended ESG Leaders Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 296 Index\nDescription. The MSCI USA Extended ESG Leaders\nIndex is designed to reflect the equity\nperformance of U.S. companies that have\nfavorable ESG characteristics (as determined\nby the Index Provider). The Underlying Index\nis constructed by selecting constituents from\nthe parent index that aims to include\nsecurities of companies with the highest ESG\nratings, as determined by the Index Provider,\nrepresenting 50% of the market capitalization\nin each sector of the parent index. The Fund\u2019s\nIndex Provider begins with the parent index\nand excludes securities of companies involved\nin the business of tobacco, alcohol, gambling,\nnuclear power, thermal coal and unconventional\noil and gas businesses ( e.g., thermal coal\nextraction and generation or oil sands\nextraction) companies involved with\nconventional and controversial weapons,\nproducers and major retailers of civilian\nfirearms, as well as companies involved in\nvery severe business controversies. The Index\nProvider defines a controversy as an instance\nor ongoing situation in which company\noperations and/or products allegedly have a\nnegative environmental, social and/or\ngovernance impact. Each controversy case is\nassessed for the severity of its impact on\nsociety. The Index Provider generally\nclassifies companies as \u201c involved \u201d in a\nparticular business based on revenue or\npercentage of revenue thresholds ( e.g., $1\nbillion or 50%) for certain products and\nactivities in an excluded industry. The\nsecurities of certain companies may be\nexcluded regardless of revenue measures ( e.g.\n, all companies involved in the manufacturing\nof nuclear weapons are excluded). The Index\nProvider then follows a quantitative process\nthat is designed to determine optimal weights\nfor securities to maximize exposure to\nsecurities of companies with higher ESG\nratings, subject to maintaining 50% of the\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization\nwithin each sector of the parent index. In\norder to evaluate a security\u2019s ESG rating for\na given sector, the Index Provider identifies\nkey ESG issues that can lead to unexpected\ncosts for companies in the medium- to long-\nterm. The Index Provider then calculates the\nsize of each company\u2019s exposure to each key\nissue based on the company\u2019s business segment\nand geographic risk and analyzes the extent to\nwhich companies have developed robust\nstrategies and programs to manage ESG risks\nand opportunities. Using a sector-specific key\nissue weighting model, companies are rated and\nranked in comparison to their industry peers.\nBecause ESG ratings are calculated in\ncomparison to a company\u2019s sector peers,\nsecurities in one sector may have a lower\naverage ESG rating than securities in another\nsector. Calculation Methodology. The Fund\nutilizes the Underlying Index calculated with\ngross dividends reinvested. The use of gross\ndividends reflects the assumed reinvestment of\nthe entire dividend distributed to holders of\nthe underlying stock, without any adjustment\nfor taxes or withholding. The Underlying Index\nis rebalanced on a quarterly basis coinciding\nwith the regular Index Reviews of the MSCI\nGlobal Investable Market Indexes. MSCI USA\nGrowth Extended ESG Focus Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 143 Index\nDescription. The Underlying Index is an\noptimized equity index designed to reflect the\nequity performance of U.S. companies that\nexhibit growth characteristics as well as\npositive ESG characteristics, as determined by\nthe Index Provider and risk and return\ncharacteristics similar to those of the MSCI\nUSA Growth Index (the \u201c parent index \u201d ). The\nparent index includes U.S. large- and mid-\ncapitalization stocks that generally represent\napproximately 50% of the free float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization of the MSCI USA Index\nand that are identified by MSCI as exhibiting\noverall growth style characteristics. MSCI\nuses five variables to identify growth style\nsecurities: long-term forward earnings per\nshare ( \u201c EPS \u201d ) growth rate, short-term\nforward EPS growth rate, current internal\ngrowth rate, long-term historical EPS growth\ntrend and long-term historical sales per share\ngrowth trend. MSCI uses a specialized\nframework to determine the extent to which a\nsecurity is assigned to\n\n50\n\nthe value or growth style. It is possible for\na single security to have representation in\nboth value and growth style indexes; however,\nno more than 100% of a security\u2019s float-\nadjusted market capitalization is included\nwithin the combined style framework. Index\nMethodology. To construct the Underlying\nIndex, the Index Provider begins with the\nparent index and excludes securities of\nissuers that it identifies as being involved\nin any of the business activities summarized\nbelow: \u2022 Companies that meet the Index\nProvider\u2019s determination of \u201c tobacco\ninvolvement, \u201d including companies classified\nas a producer or licensor, companies that own\nor are owned by a tobacco company, and\ncompanies that earn 15% or more of their\nrevenue from tobacco products. \u2022 Companies\nwith any tie to controversial weapons (defined\nby the Index Provider as cluster munitions,\nlandmines, biological and chemical weapons,\ndepleted uranium weapons, blinding laser\nweapons, incendiary weapons and non-\ndetectable fragments). \u2022 Companies classified\nas a producer of civilian firearms (as defined\nby the Index Provider) as well as companies\nclassified as retailers of civilian firearms\nif such retailers earn 5% or more, or more\nthan $20 million, in revenue from civilian\nfirearms-related products. \u2022 Companies that\nderive 5% or more in revenue from the mining\nor sales to external parties of thermal coal\n(excluding metallurgical coal) or from thermal\ncoal-based power generation (as defined by the\nIndex Provider). \u2022 Companies that own oil\nsands reserves and derive more than 5% in\nrevenue from oil sands extraction. The Index\nProvider also excludes companies that are\ndirectly involved in very severe, ongoing\nbusiness controversies, defined as an instance\nor ongoing situation in which company\noperations and/or products allegedly have a\nnegative ESG impact, including alleged\nviolations of laws, regulations, or accepted\ninternational norms ( e.g. , human rights\nviolations or toxic emissions and waste). In\neach case, severe business controversies are\ndetermined by the Index Provider based on an\nMSCI ESG Controversy Score. The Index Provider\nalso excludes companies that are not assessed\nby the Index Provider to determine their\ninvolvement in severe business controversies\nor their management of ESG risks and\nopportunities ( \u201c ESG Score, \u201d in each case\ndetermined by the Index Provider). For ESG\nscoring, the Index Provider identifies, for\neach industry, key ESG issues that may\ngenerate unanticipated costs for a given\ncompany or industry (as determined by the\nIndex Provider). The Index Provider has\nidentified 35 key ESG issues across the\nfollowing 10 themes: climate change, natural\ncapital, pollution and waste, environmental\nopportunities, human capital, product\nliability, stakeholder opposition, social\nopportunities, corporate governance and\ncorporate behavior. The Index Provider then\ncalculates the size of each company\u2019s exposure\nto each key issue based on the company\u2019s\nbusiness segment and geographic risk and\nanalyzes the extent to which the company has\ndeveloped robust strategies and programs to\nmanage ESG risks and opportunities. Using a\nsector-specific weighting model, companies are\nrated and ranked in comparison to their\nindustry peers. A higher rating indicates that\na company exhibits more favorable ESG\ncharacteristics and greater resilience to\nlong-term, material ESG risks specific to that\nindustry. The Index Provider then follows a\nquantitative process that is designed to\ndetermine optimal weights for securities in\norder to maximize exposure to securities of\ncompanies with higher ESG ratings, subject to\nmaintaining risk and return characteristics\nsimilar to the parent index. At each quarterly\nindex review and rebalance, the Index Provider\napplies optimization constraints that include\nthe following: (a) the weight of an index\nconstituent is restricted to the lesser of a\n+/-2% deviation from the weight in the parent\nindex and 20 times the weight in the parent\nindex; (b) the minimum weight of an index\nconstituent is 0.10%; (c) the sector weights\nof the Underlying Index do not deviate more\nthan +/- 5% from the sector weights of the\nparent index; (d) the predicted tracking error\nvs. the parent index is capped at 0.75%; and\n(e) the one-way turnover of the Underlying\nIndex is capped at 10% for the May and\nNovember rebalances and 5% for the February\nand August rebalances. During an index review,\nif there is no solution that satisfies all of\nthe optimization constraints, the turnover\nconstraint will be relaxed, in steps of 1%, up\nto a maximum of 30%. If a feasible solution is\nnot found at turnover of 30%, the predicted\ntracking error will be relaxed, in steps of\n0.10%, up to a maximum of 5 times the original\npredicted tracking error. If a feasible\nsolution is still not found, the Underlying\nIndex will not be rebalanced for that index\nreview. MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus\nIndex Number of Components: approximately 969\n\n51\n\nIndex Description . The Underlying Index, the\nMSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index,\nis designed to produce investment results\ncomparable to the MSCI USA Small Cap Index,\nthe parent index, while reflecting a higher\nallocation than that of the parent index to\nU.S. small-capitalization companies with\nfavorable ESG profiles. The Underlying Index\nis constructed by selecting constituents from\nthe parent index through an optimization\nprocess that aims to maximize exposure to ESG\nfactors subject to a target tracking error\nconstraint of 50 basis points relative to the\nparent index. In constructing the Underlying\nIndex, the Fund\u2019s index provider begins with\nthe parent index and excludes securities of\ncompanies involved in the business of tobacco,\ncompanies involved with controversial weapons,\nproducers and retailers of civilian firearms,\nand companies involved in certain fossil\nfuels-related activity such as the production\nof thermal coal, thermal coal-based power\ngeneration and extraction of oil sands based\non revenue or percentage of revenue thresholds\nfor certain categories ( e.g., $20 million or\n5%) and categorical exclusions for others (\ne.g., controversial weapons). The Index\nProvider also excludes companies involved in\nvery severe business controversies (in each\ncase as determined by the index provider). The\nindex provider identifies key ESG\ncontroversies, including, among other things,\nissues involving: (i) the environment ( e.g.,\nbiodiversity and land use, toxic emissions and\nwaste, energy and climate change, water\nstress, nonhazardous operational waste, and\nsupply chain management); (ii) human rights\nand communities ( e.g., impact on local\ncommunities, human rights concerns, and civil\nliberties); (iii) labor rights and supply\nchains ( e.g., child labor, collective\nbargaining and union, health and safety,\ndiscrimination and workforce diversity, and\nlabor management relations); (iv) customers (\ne.g., anti-competitive practices, customer\nrelations, privacy and data security, product\nsafety and quality, and marketing and\nadvertising); and (v) governance ( e.g.,\nbribery and fraud, governance structures, and\ncontroversial investments). The index provider\nthen rates each company\u2019s exposure to these\nESG issues and evaluates the extent to which\nthe company has created strategies and\nprograms to manage ESG risks and\nopportunities. Companies are scored by the\nindex provider based on both their risk\nexposure and risk management, and then ranked\nin comparison to their industry peers. The\nindex provider then follows a quantitative\nprocess that is designed to determine optimal\nweights for securities in the Underlying Index\nto maximize exposure to companies with higher\nESG ratings, subject to maintaining risk and\nreturn characteristics similar to those of the\nparent index. Optimization is a quantitative\nprocess that considers the market\ncapitalization weights from the parent index,\nESG scores and additional constraints,\nincluding constraints around predicted\ntracking error, constituent weights, sector\nweights, and risk aversion, to select and\nweight the constituents of the Underlying\nIndex. Calculation Methodology . The Fund\nutilizes the Underlying Index calculated with\ngross dividends reinvested. The use of gross\ndividends reflects the assumed reinvestment of\nthe entire dividend distributed to holders of\nthe underlying stock, without any adjustment\nfor taxes or withholding. The Underlying Index\nis rebalanced on a quarterly basis coinciding\nwith the regular Index Reviews of the MSCI\nGlobal Investable Market Indexes. MSCI USA\nValue Extended ESG Focus Index Number of\nComponents: approximately 218 Index\nDescription. The Underlying Index is an\noptimized equity index designed to reflect the\nequity performance of U.S. companies that\nexhibit value characteristics as well as\npositive ESG characteristics, as determined by\nthe Index Provider and risk and return\ncharacteristics similar to those of the MSCI\nUSA Value Index (the \u201c parent index \u201d ). The\nparent index includes U.S. large- and mid-\ncapitalization stocks that generally represent\napproximately 50% of the free float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization of the MSCI USA Index\nand that are identified by MSCI as exhibiting\noverall value style characteristics. MSCI uses\nthree variables to identify value style\nsecurities: book value-to-price ratio,\n12-month forward earnings-to-price ratio and\ndividend yield. MSCI uses a specialized\nframework to determine the extent to which a\nsecurity is assigned to the value or growth\nstyle. It is possible for a single security to\nhave representation in both value and growth\nstyle indexes; however, no more than 100% of a\nsecurity\u2019s float-adjusted market\ncapitalization is included within the combined\nstyle framework. Index Methodology. To\nconstruct the Underlying Index, the Index\nProvider begins with the parent index and\nexcludes securities of issuers that it\nidentifies as being involved in any of the\nbusiness activities summarized below: \u2022\nCompanies that meet the Index Provider\u2019s\ndetermination of \u201c tobacco involvement, \u201d\nincluding companies classified as a producer\nor licensor, companies that own or are owned\nby a tobacco company, and companies that earn\n15% or more of their revenue from tobacco\nproducts. \u2022 Companies with any tie to\ncontroversial weapons (defined by the Index\nProvider as cluster munitions, landmines,\n\n52\n\nbiological and chemical weapons, depleted\nuranium weapons, blinding laser weapons,\nincendiary weapons and non-detectable\nfragments). \u2022 Companies classified as a\nproducer of civilian firearms (as defined by\nthe Index Provider) as well as companies\nclassified as retailers of civilian firearms\nif such retailers earn 5% or more, or more\nthan $20 million, in revenue from civilian\nfirearms-related products. \u2022 Companies that\nderive 5% or more in revenue from the mining\nor sales to external parties of thermal coal\n(excluding metallurgical coal) or from thermal\ncoal-based power generation (as defined by the\nIndex Provider). \u2022 Companies that own oil\nsands reserves and derive more than 5% in\nrevenue from oil sands extraction. The Index\nProvider also excludes companies that are\ndirectly involved in very severe, ongoing\nbusiness controversies, defined as an instance\nor ongoing situation in which company\noperations and/or products allegedly have a\nnegative ESG impact, including alleged\nviolations of laws, regulations, or accepted\ninternational norms ( e.g. , human rights\nviolations or toxic emissions and waste). In\neach case, severe business controversies are\ndetermined by the Index Provider based on an\nMSCI ESG Controversy Score. The Index Provider\nalso excludes companies that are not assessed\nby the Index Provider to determine their\ninvolvement in severe business controversies\nor their management of ESG risks and\nopportunities ( \u201c ESG Score, \u201d in each case\ndetermined by the Index Provider). For ESG\nscoring, the Index Provider identifies, for\neach industry, key ESG issues that may\ngenerate unanticipated costs for a given\ncompany or industry (as determined by the\nIndex Provider). The Index Provider has\nidentified 35 key ESG issues across the\nfollowing 10 themes: climate change, natural\ncapital, pollution and waste, environmental\nopportunities, human capital, product\nliability, stakeholder opposition, social\nopportunities, corporate governance and\ncorporate behavior. The Index Provider then\ncalculates the size of each company\u2019s exposure\nto each key issue based on the company\u2019s\nbusiness segment and geographic risk and\nanalyzes the extent to which the company has\ndeveloped robust strategies and programs to\nmanage ESG risks and opportunities. Using a\nsector-specific weighting model, companies are\nrated and ranked in comparison to their\nindustry peers. A higher rating indicates that\na company exhibits more favorable ESG\ncharacteristics and greater resilience to\nlong-term, material ESG risks specific to that\nindustry. The Index Provider then follows a\nquantitative process that is designed to\ndetermine optimal weights for securities in\norder to maximize exposure to securities of\ncompanies with higher ESG ratings, subject to\nmaintaining risk and return characteristics\nsimilar to the parent index. At each quarterly\nindex review and rebalance, the Index Provider\napplies optimization constraints that include\nthe following: (a) the weight of an index\nconstituent is restricted to the lesser of a\n+/-2% deviation from the weight in the parent\nindex and 20 times the weight in the parent\nindex; (b) the minimum weight of an index\nconstituent is 0.10%; (c) the sector weights\nof the Underlying Index do not deviate more\nthan +/- 5% from the sector weights of the\nparent index; (d) the predicted tracking error\nvs. the parent index is capped at 0.75%; and\n(e) the one-way turnover of the Underlying\nIndex is capped at 10% for the May and\nNovember rebalances and 5% for the February\nand August rebalances. During an index review,\nif there is no solution that satisfies all of\nthe optimization constraints, the turnover\nconstraint will be relaxed, in steps of 1%, up\nto a maximum of 30%. If a feasible solution is\nnot found at turnover of 30%, the predicted\ntracking error will be relaxed, in steps of\n0.10%, up to a maximum of 5 times the original\npredicted tracking error. If a feasible\nsolution is still not found, the Underlying\nIndex will not be rebalanced for that index\nreview.

Notations\nRegarding the iShares Climate Conscious &\nTransition MSCI USA ETF's, iShares Emergent\nFood and AgTech Multisector ETF's, iShares ESG\nAdvanced MSCI EAFE ETF's, iShares ESG Advanced\nMSCI USA ETF's, iShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE\nETF's, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF's,\niShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Growth ETF's,\niShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Small-Cap ETF's,\niShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Value ETF's,\niShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders ETF's, iShares\nMSCI Japan Value ETF's and iShares Paris-\nAligned Climate MSCI USA ETF's Fundamental\nInvestment Policies The following notations\nare not considered to be part of each Fund\u2019s\nfundamental investment policies and are\nsubject to change without shareholder\napproval. With respect to the fundamental\npolicy relating to concentration set forth in\n(1) above, the Investment Company Act does not\ndefine what constitutes \u201c concentration \u201d in\nan industry. The SEC staff has taken the\nposition that investment of 25% or more of a\nfund\u2019s total assets in one or more issuers\nconducting their principal activities in the\nsame industry or group of industries\nconstitutes concentration. It is possible that\ninterpretations of concentration could change\nin the future. The policy in (1) above will be\ninterpreted to refer to concentration as that\nterm may be interpreted from time to time. The\npolicy also will be interpreted to permit\ninvestment without limit in the following:\nsecurities of the U.S. government and its\nagencies or instrumentalities; securities of\nstate, territory, possession or municipal\ngovernments and their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the\n\n55\n\nindustries of their parents if their\nactivities are primarily related to financing\nthe activities of the parents. Each foreign\ngovernment will be considered to be a member\nof a separate industry. With respect to each\nFund's industry classifications, each Fund\ncurrently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to each\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits each Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund's total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires each Fund to maintain at all\ntimes an \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300%\nof the amount of its borrowings. Asset\ncoverage means the ratio that the value of\neach Fund's total assets (including amounts\nborrowed), minus liabilities other than\nborrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of\nall borrowings. Borrowing money to increase\nportfolio holdings is known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d\nCertain trading practices and investments,\nsuch as reverse repurchase agreements, may be\nconsidered to be borrowings or involve\nleverage and thus are subject to the\nInvestment Company Act restrictions. In\naccordance with Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act, when each Fund engages\nin reverse repurchase agreements and similar\nfinancing transactions, the Fund may either\n(i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300%\nwith respect to such transactions and any\nother borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii)\ntreat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of a fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the business of underwriting, the\npolicy in (5) above will be interpreted not to\nprevent a fund from engaging in transactions\ninvolving the acquisition or disposition of\nportfolio securities, regardless of whether a\nfund may be considered to be an underwriter\nunder the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in\nthe underwriting business to the extent\npermitted by applicable law. With respect to\nthe fundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit each Fund from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nFor the iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF The\niShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF will not: 1.\nMake loans, except as permitted under the 1940\nAct, as interpreted, modified or otherwise\npermitted by regulatory authority having\njurisdiction, from time to time; 2. Issue any\nsenior security, except as permitted under the\n1940 Act, as interpreted, modified or\notherwise permitted by regulatory authority\nhaving jurisdiction, from time to time; 3.\nPledge, hypothecate, mortgage or otherwise\nencumber its assets, except to secure\npermitted borrowings. (The deposit of\nunderlying securities and other assets in\nescrow and collateral arrangements with\nrespect to initial or variation margin for\ncurrency transactions and futures contracts\nwill not be deemed to be pledges of the Fund\u2019s\nassets);\n\n56\n\n4. Purchase, hold or deal in real estate, or\noil, gas or mineral interests or leases, but a\nFund may purchase and sell securities that are\nissued by companies that invest or deal in\nsuch assets; 5. Act as an underwriter of\nsecurities of other issuers, except to the\nextent the Fund may be deemed an underwriter\nin connection with the sale of securities in\nits portfolio; 6. Purchase securities on\nmargin, except for such short-term credits as\nare necessary for the clearance of\ntransactions, except that a Fund may make\nmargin deposits in connection with\ntransactions in currencies, options, futures\nand options on futures; 7. Sell securities\nshort; or 8. Invest in commodities or\ncommodity contracts, except that the Fund may\nbuy and sell currencies and forward contracts\nwith respect thereto, and may transact in\nfutures contracts on securities, stock indices\nand currencies and options on such futures\ncontracts and make margin deposits in\nconnection with such contracts. Industry\nconcentration. The iShares MSCI United Kingdom\nETF will not concentrate its investments (\ni.e. , hold 25% or more of its total assets in\nthe stocks of a particular industry or group\nof industries), except that, to the extent\npracticable, the Fund will concentrate to\napproximately the same extent that its\nbenchmark MSCI Index concentrates in the\nstocks of such particular industry or group of\nindustries, provided that the Fund will comply\nwith the diversification requirements of the\nInternal Revenue Code applicable to RICs, any\nunderlying Treasury regulations or any\nsuccessor provision. Non-Fundamental\nInvestment Policies For the iShares MSCI\nUnited Kingdom ETF The iShares MSCI United\nKingdom ETF observes the following\nrestrictions, which may be changed by the\nBoard without a shareholder vote. The Fund\nwill not invest in the securities of a company\nfor the purpose of exercising management or\ncontrol, or in any event purchase and hold\nmore than 10% of the securities of a single\nissuer, provided that the Trust may vote the\ninvestment securities owned by the Fund in\naccordance with its views. If any percentage\nrestriction described above is complied with\nto at the time of investment, a later increase\nor decrease in percentage resulting from any\nchange in value or total or net assets will\nnot constitute in a violation of such\nrestriction, except that certain percentage\nlimitations will be observed continuously in\naccordance with applicable law. The iShares\nMSCI United Kingdom ETF has adopted a non-\nfundamental investment policy in accordance\nwith Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest,\nunder normal circumstances, at least 80% of\nthe value of its net assets, plus the amount\nof any borrowings for investment purposes, in\ncomponent securities, and in ADRs based on\nsecurities, in its Underlying Index. The Fund\nalso has adopted a policy to provide its\nshareholders with at least 60 days' prior\nwritten notice of any change in such policy.\nIf, subsequent to an investment, the 80%\nrequirement is no longer met, the Fund's\nfuture investments will be made in a manner\nthat will bring the Fund into compliance with\nthis policy. For the iShares Climate Conscious\n& Transition MSCI USA ETF, iShares Emergent\nFood and AgTech Multisector ETF, iShares ESG\nAdvanced MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares ESG Advanced\nMSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF,\niShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG\nAware MSCI USA Growth ETF, iShares ESG Aware\nMSCI USA Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI\nUSA Value ETF, iShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders\nETF, iShares MSCI Japan Value ETF and iShares\nParis-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF Each Fund\nhas adopted a non-fundamental policy not to\nmake short sales of securities or maintain a\nshort position, except to the extent permitted\nby each Fund's Prospectus and SAI, as amended\nfrom time to time, and applicable law. All\nFunds Each Fund (other than the iShares\nClimate Conscious & Transition MSCI USA ETF,\niShares Emergent Food and AgTech Multisector\nETF, iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EAFE ETF,\niShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG\nAware MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI\nUSA ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Growth\nETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Small-Cap ETF,\niShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Value ETF, iShares\nESG MSCI USA Leaders ETF, iShares MSCI Japan\nValue ETF, iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF and\niShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF)\nhas adopted a non-fundamental policy not to\n\n57\n\ninvest in the securities of a company for the\npurpose of exercising management or control,\nor purchase or otherwise acquire any illiquid\ninvestment, except as permitted under the 1940\nAct, which currently limits each Fund's\nholdings in illiquid investments to 15% of a\nFund's net assets. BFA monitors Fund holdings\nin illiquid investments, pursuant to the\nLiquidity Program. If any percentage\nrestriction described above is complied with\nat the time of an investment, a later increase\nor decrease in percentage resulting from a\nchange in values of assets will not constitute\na violation of such restriction, except that\ncertain percentage limitations will be\nobserved continuously in accordance with\napplicable law. Each Fund (other than the\niShares Climate Conscious & Transition MSCI\nUSA ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Growth\nETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Small-Cap ETF,\niShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Value ETF and\niShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF) has adopted a\nnon-fundamental investment policy in\naccordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act\nto invest, under normal circumstances, at\nleast 80% of the value of its net assets, plus\nthe amount of any borrowings for investment\npurposes, in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index or in depositary receipts\nrepresenting component securities in its\nUnderlying Index. Each of the iShares Climate\nConscious & Transition MSCI USA ETF, iShares\nESG Aware MSCI USA Growth ETF, iShares ESG\nAware MSCI USA Small-Cap ETF and iShares ESG\nAware MSCI USA Value ETF has adopted a non-\nfundamental investment policy in accordance\nwith Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest,\nunder normal circumstances, at least 80% of\nthe value of its net assets, plus the amount\nof any borrowings for investment purposes, in\nthe component securities of its Underlying\nIndex. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to\nprovide its shareholders with at least 60\ndays\u2019 prior written notice of any change in\nsuch policy. If, subsequent to an investment,\nthe 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund\u2019s\nfuture investments will be made in a manner\nthat will bring the Fund into compliance with\nthis policy. Each Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental policy not to purchase securities\nof other investment companies, except to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter\nof policy, however, a Fund will not purchase\nshares of any registered open-end investment\ncompany or registered unit investment trust,\nin reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the\n\u201c fund of funds \u201d provisions) of the 1940 Act,\nat any time the Fund has knowledge that its\nshares are purchased by another investment\ncompany investor in reliance on the provisions\nof subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).\nUnless otherwise indicated, all limitations\nunder each Fund's fundamental or non-\nfundamental investment policies apply only at\nthe time that a transaction is undertaken. Any\nchange in the percentage of each Fund's assets\ninvested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from market fluctuations\nor other changes in each Fund\u2019s total assets\nwill not require each Fund to dispose of an\ninvestment until BFA determines that it is\npracticable to sell or close out the\ninvestment without undue market or tax\nconsequences. Continuous Offering The method\nby which Creation Units are created and traded\nmay raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery requirement and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client\nmay be deemed a statutory underwriter if it\ntakes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into\nconstituent shares and sells such shares\ndirectly to customers or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of new shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the 1933 Act must take into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-\ndealer or its client in the particular case\nand the examples mentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions\nin shares, whether or not participating in the\ndistribution of shares, generally are required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in\nrespect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus delivery obligation with\nrespect to shares of the Funds are reminded\nthat, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act,\na prospectus delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange\nmember in connection with a sale on the\nListing Exchange generally is satisfied by the\nfact that the\n\n58\n\nprospectus is available at the Listing\nExchange upon request. The prospectus delivery\nmechanism provided in Rule 153 is available\nonly with respect to transactions on an\nexchange. Management Trustees and Officers.\nThe Board has responsibility for the overall\nmanagement and operations of the Funds,\nincluding general supervision of the duties\nperformed by BFA and other service providers.\nEach Trustee serves until he or she resigns,\nis removed, dies, retires or becomes\nincapacitated. Each officer shall hold office\nuntil his or her successor is elected and\nqualifies or until his or her death,\nresignation or removal. Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Trust are referred to as\nindependent trustees ( \u201c Independent Trustees\n\u201d ). The registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nBlackRock-advised Funds \u201d ) are organized into\none complex of open-end equity, multi-asset,\nindex and money market funds and ETFs (the \u201c\nBlackRock Multi-Asset Complex \u201d ), one complex\nof closed-end funds and open-end non-index\nfixed-income funds (including ETFs) (the \u201c\nBlackRock Fixed-Income Complex \u201d ) and one\ncomplex of ETFs ( \u201c Exchange-Traded Fund\nComplex \u201d ) (each, a \u201c BlackRock Fund Complex\n\u201d ). Each Fund is included in the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves\nas a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee\nof iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result,\noversees all of the funds within the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex, which consists of 403\nfunds as of December 29, 2023. With the\nexception of Robert S. Kapito, Salim Ramji,\nDominik Roh\u00e9 and Aaron Wasserman, the address\nof each Trustee and officer is c/o BlackRock,\nInc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA\n94105.

Board \u2013\nLeadership Structure and Oversight\nResponsibilities Overall responsibility for\noversight of the Funds rests with the Board.\nThe Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds\non a day-to-day basis. The Board is\nresponsible for overseeing BFA and other\nservice providers in the operations of the\nFunds in accordance with the provisions of the\n1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and\nother laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The Board\nis currently composed of eleven members, nine\nof whom are Independent Trustees. The Board\ncurrently conducts regular in person meetings\nfour times a year. In addition, the Board\nfrequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The Independent Trustees meet\nregularly outside the presence of management,\nin executive session or with other service\nproviders to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Funds, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Funds with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the\n\n66\n\noversight functions delegated to the Committee\nby the Board and reports its finding to the\nBoard. The Board and each standing Committee\nconduct annual assessments of their oversight\nfunction and structure. The Board has\ndetermined that the Board\u2019s leadership\nstructure is appropriate because it allows the\nBoard to exercise independent judgment over\nmanagement and it allocates areas of\nresponsibility among committees of Independent\nTrustees and the full Board to enhance\neffective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Funds is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Funds. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of each\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Funds. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by each Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting each Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Funds'\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support each Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight responsibilities.\nFrom time to time, the Board may modify the\nmanner in which it conducts risk oversight.\nThe Board\u2019s oversight role does not make it a\nguarantor of the Funds' investment performance\nor other activities.

Certain activities of\nBFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively\nreferred to in this section as \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, with respect to the Funds and/or\nother accounts managed by BlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, including the business units or\nentities and personnel who may be involved in\nthe investment activities and business\noperations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in\nbusinesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Funds. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage a Fund and\nits shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by a Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of a\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Funds. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which a Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\na Fund's performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or client accounts, will be executed\nindependently of a Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFunds. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or\nsell the same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding a Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor a Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of a\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding a\nFund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for a Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause a Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so. Conflicts may also\narise because portfolio decisions regarding a\nFund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby a Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and\nthe purchase of a security or covering of a\nshort position in a security by a Fund may\nincrease the price of the same security held\nby (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its\nother accounts or funds. In addition, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, certain\nFunds may invest their assets in other funds\nadvised by BlackRock, including funds that are\nmanaged by one or more of the same portfolio\nmanagers, which\n\n83\n\ncould result in conflicts of interest relating\nto asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases\nand sales, and increased remuneration and\nprofitability for BlackRock, and/or its\npersonnel, including portfolio managers. In\ncertain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of\nthe Funds, may seek to buy from or sell\nsecurities to another fund or account advised\nby BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not\nrequired to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when a\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which a Fund has\ninvested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of a\nFund's investments may be negatively impacted\nby the activities of BlackRock or its clients,\nand transactions for the Fund may be impaired\nor effected at prices or terms that may be\nless favorable than would otherwise have been\nthe case. The results of a Fund\u2019s investment\nactivities may differ significantly from the\nresults achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by a Fund.\nMoreover, it is possible that a Fund will\nsustain losses during periods in which one or\nmore proprietary or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock achieve significant\nprofits. The opposite result is also possible.\nFrom time to time, a Fund may be restricted\nfrom purchasing or selling securities, or from\nengaging in other investment activities\nbecause of regulatory, legal or contractual\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock or other\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock,\nand/or the internal policies of BlackRock\ndesigned to comply with such requirements. As\na result, there may be periods, for example,\nwhen BlackRock will not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions in certain\nsecurities or instruments with respect to\nwhich BlackRock is performing services or when\nposition limits have been reached. For\nexample, the investment activities of\nBlackRock for its proprietary accounts and\naccounts under its management may limit the\ninvestment opportunities for a Fund in certain\nemerging and other markets in which\nlimitations are imposed upon the amount of\ninvestment, in the aggregate or in individual\nissuers, by affiliated foreign investors. In\nconnection with its management of a Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on behalf of a Fund in\naccordance with such analysis and models. In\naddition, BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to make available any information\nregarding its proprietary activities or\nstrategies, or the activities or strategies\nused for other accounts managed by them, for\nthe benefit of the management of a Fund and it\nis not anticipated that BlackRock will have\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the\nactivities or strategies used for accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock or other client accounts\ncould conflict with the transactions and\nstrategies employed by BlackRock in managing a\nFund. The Funds may be included in investment\nmodels developed by BlackRock for use by\nclients and financial advisors. To the extent\nclients invest in these investment models and\nincrease the assets under management of the\nFunds, the investment management fee amounts\npaid by the Funds to BlackRock may also\nincrease. The price, availability and\nliquidity of a Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by model-\ndriven investment portfolios, as well as by\nBlackRock itself and by its advisory clients.\nIn addition, certain principals and certain\nemployees of a Fund\u2019s investment adviser are\nalso principals or employees of other business\nunits or entities within BlackRock. As a\nresult, these principals and employees may\nhave obligations to such other business units\nor entities or their clients and such\nobligations to other business units or\nentities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in a Fund\nshould be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund\nin which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty\n\n84\n\nmay have no incentive to assure that the Fund\nobtains the best possible prices or terms in\nconnection with the transactions. In addition,\nthe purchase, holding and sale of such\ninvestments by a Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which a Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non a Fund could potentially lead to increased\npurchase activity with respect to the Fund and\nincreased assets under management for\nBlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Funds or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may from\ntime to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. A Fund may, subject\nto applicable law, purchase investments that\nare the subject of an underwriting or other\ndistribution by BlackRock and may also enter\ninto transactions with other clients of\nBlackRock where such other clients have\ninterests adverse to those of the Fund. At\ntimes, these activities may cause business\nunits or entities within BlackRock to give\nadvice to clients that may cause these clients\nto take actions adverse to the interests of a\nFund. To the extent such transactions are\npermitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock on\nan arm\u2019s-length basis. To the extent\nauthorized by applicable law, BlackRock may\nact as broker, dealer, agent, lender or\nadviser or in other commercial capacities for\na Fund. It is anticipated that the\ncommissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial\nadvisory fees, underwriting and placement\nfees, sales fees, financing and commitment\nfees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation\nor profits, rates, terms and conditions\ncharged by BlackRock will be in its view\ncommercially reasonable, although BlackRock,\nincluding its sales personnel, will have an\ninterest in obtaining fees and other amounts\nthat are favorable to BlackRock and such sales\npersonnel, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Funds. Index based funds may use an index\nprovider that is affiliated with another\nservice provider of a Fund or BlackRock that\nacts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in\nother commercial capacities for a Fund or\nBlackRock. Subject to applicable law,\nBlackRock (and its personnel and other\ndistributors) will be entitled to retain fees\nand other amounts that they receive in\nconnection with their service to the Funds as\nbroker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in\nother commercial capacities. No accounting to\nthe Funds or their shareholders will be\nrequired, and no fees or other compensation\npayable by the Funds or their shareholders\nwill be reduced by reason of receipt by\nBlackRock of any such fees or other amounts.\nWhen BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities in\nrelation to the Funds, BlackRock may take\ncommercial steps in its own interests, which\nmay have an adverse effect on the Funds. A\nFund will be required to establish business\nrelationships with its counterparties based on\nthe Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will\nnot have any obligation to allow its credit to\nbe used in connection with a Fund's\nestablishment of its business relationships,\nnor is it expected that the Fund's\ncounterparties will rely on the credit of\nBlackRock in evaluating the Fund's\ncreditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of BFA\npursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFunds. BlackRock will also receive\ncompensation for managing the reinvestment of\nthe cash collateral from securities lending.\nThere are potential conflicts of interests in\nmanaging a securities lending program,\nincluding but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto increase or decrease the amount of\nsecurities on loan or to lend particular\nsecurities in order to generate additional\nrisk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its\naffiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to\nallocate loans to clients that would provide\nmore revenue to BlackRock. As described\nfurther below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate\nthis conflict by providing its securities\nlending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation.\n\n85\n\nAs part of its securities lending program,\nBlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain\nother clients and/or funds against a shortfall\nin collateral in the event of borrower\ndefault. On a regular basis, BlackRock\ncalculates the potential dollar exposure of\ncollateral shortfall resulting from a borrower\ndefault ( \u201c shortfall risk \u201d ) in the\nsecurities lending program. BlackRock\nestablishes program-wide borrower limits ( \u201c\ncredit limits \u201d ) to actively manage borrower-\nspecific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees\nthe risk model that calculates projected\ncollateral shortfall values using loan-level\nfactors such as loan and collateral type and\nmarket value as well as specific borrower\ncredit characteristics. When necessary,\nBlackRock may adjust securities lending\nprogram attributes by restricting eligible\ncollateral or reducing borrower credit limits.\nAs a result, the management of program-wide\nexposure as well as BlackRock-specific\nindemnification exposure may affect the amount\nof securities lending activity BlackRock may\nconduct at any given point in time by reducing\nthe volume of lending opportunities for\ncertain loans (including by asset type,\ncollateral type and/or revenue profile).\nBlackRock uses a predetermined systematic\nprocess in order to approximate pro rata\nallocation over time. In order to allocate a\nloan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole\nmust have sufficient lending capacity pursuant\nto the various program limits ( i.e.,\nindemnification exposure limit and borrower\ncredit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio\nmust hold the asset at the time a loan\nopportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending\nportfolio must also have enough inventory,\neither on its own or when aggregated with\nother portfolios into one single market\ndelivery, to satisfy the loan request. In\ndoing so, BlackRock seeks to provide equal\nlending opportunities for all portfolios,\nindependent of whether BlackRock indemnifies\nthe portfolio. Equal opportunities for lending\nportfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes.\nSpecifically, short and long-term outcomes for\nindividual clients may vary due to asset mix,\nasset/liability spreads on different\nsecurities, and the overall limits imposed by\nthe firm. BlackRock may decline to make a\nsecurities loan on behalf of a Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of a\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for a Fund may be\nbunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Funds will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Funds. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Funds will\nnot be charged the same commission or\ncommission equivalent rates in connection with\na bunched or aggregated order. Subject to\napplicable law, BlackRock may select brokers\nthat furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other\nBlackRock client accounts or personnel,\ndirectly or through correspondent\nrelationships, with research or other\nappropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Funds and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the\nFunds based on the amount of brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Funds and such other\nBlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client's commissions may not be\nused in managing that client's account. In\naddition, other BlackRock client accounts may\nreceive the benefit, including\ndisproportionate benefits, of economies of\nscale or price discounts in connection with\nproducts and services that may be provided to\nthe Funds and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself.\n\n86\n\nBlackRock does not currently enter into\narrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or\nparticipate in, soft dollars, although\nBlackRock may receive research that is bundled\nwith the trade execution, clearing, and/or\nsettlement services provided by a particular\nbroker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock\nreceives research on this basis, many of the\nsame conflicts related to traditional soft\ndollars may exist. For example, the research\neffectively will be paid by client commissions\nthat also will be used to pay for the\nexecution, clearing, and settlement services\nprovided by the broker-dealer and will not be\npaid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless\nprohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to\nexecute trades through brokers who, pursuant\nto such arrangements, provide research or\nother services in order to ensure the\ncontinued receipt of research or other\nservices BlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to engage in\nthe above described arrangements to varying\ndegrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by\napplicable law, may also enter into commission\nsharing arrangements under which BlackRock may\nexecute transactions through a broker-dealer,\nand request that the broker-dealer allocate a\nportion of the commissions or commission\ncredits to another firm that provides research\nto BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock\nengages in commission sharing arrangements,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. BlackRock\nmay utilize certain electronic crossing\nnetworks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including, without\nlimitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an\ninvestment or other interest, to the extent\npermitted by applicable law) in executing\nclient securities transactions for certain\ntypes of securities. These ECNs may charge\nfees for their services, including access fees\nand transaction fees. The transaction fees,\nwhich are similar to commissions or\nmarkups/markdowns, will generally be charged\nto clients and, like commissions and\nmarkups/markdowns, would generally be included\nin the cost of the securities purchased.\nAccess fees may be paid by BlackRock even\nthough incurred in connection with executing\ntransactions on behalf of clients, including\nthe Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may\noffer volume discounts that will reduce the\naccess fees typically paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent\nwith its obligation to seek to obtain best\nexecution in client transactions. BlackRock\nowns a minority interest in, and is a member\nof, Members Exchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly\ncreated U.S. stock exchange. Transactions for\na Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party\nbrokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue\nfor execution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of such Funds. In addition,\ntransactions in Fund shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the\nappropriate venue for the execution of such\norders. BlackRock has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent conflicts of\ninterest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Funds, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock's fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee the Proxy Voting Policy section of this\nSAI. It is also possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of a\nFund. Increasing a Fund\u2019s assets may enhance\nliquidity, investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the\nright, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw, to sell into the market or redeem in\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of a Fund acquired for its own accounts\nor the account of a BlackRock advisory client.\nA large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund\nby BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory\nclient could significantly reduce the asset\nsize of the Fund, which might have an adverse\neffect on the Fund's liquidity, investment\nflexibility, portfolio diversification,\nexpense ratio or ability to comply with the\nlisting requirements for the Fund. It is\npossible that a Fund may invest in securities\nof, or engage in transactions with, companies\nin which BlackRock has significant debt or\nequity investments or other interests. A Fund\nmay also invest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for which\nBlackRock provides and is compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances. In making\ninvestment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is\nnot permitted to obtain or use material non-\npublic information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the activities\nof BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in\npurchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment.\n\n87\n\nBlackRock, its personnel and other financial\nservice providers may have interests in\npromoting sales of the Funds. With respect to\nBlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration\nand profitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Funds or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFunds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFunds may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor\nevents (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to a Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients'\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\na Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other data sources unavailable to the\nFund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will\ngenerally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to a Fund's\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund's pricing\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan the valuation for such security or\ninvestment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock. As disclosed in more detail in the\nDetermination of Net Asset Value section in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, each Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value by BFA. BFA has been designated\nas each Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBFA pricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BFA using proprietary or third-party\nvaluation models, fair value represents only a\ngood faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of one or\nmore assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, a Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, a Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in a Fund bearing\nsome additional expenses. BlackRock and its\ndirectors, officers and employees, may buy and\nsell securities or other investments for their\nown accounts and may have conflicts of\ninterest with respect to investments made on\nbehalf of a Fund. As a result of differing\ntrading and investment strategies or\nconstraints, positions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees that are the\nsame, different from or made at different\ntimes than positions taken for a Fund. To\nlessen the possibility that a Fund will be\nadversely affected by this personal trading,\neach Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted\na code of ethics in compliance with Section\n17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts\nsecurities trading in the personal accounts of\ninvestment professionals and others who\nnormally come into possession of information\nregarding a Fund's portfolio transactions.\nEach code of ethics is available by contacting\nBlackRock at the telephone number on the back\ncover of each Fund\u2019s Prospectus or by\naccessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's\nInternet site at http://www.sec.gov, and\ncopies may be obtained, after paying a\nduplicating fee, by e-mail at\npublicinfo@sec.gov.\n\n88\n\nBlackRock will not purchase securities or\nother property from, or sell securities or\nother property to, a Fund, except that a Fund\nmay in accordance with rules or guidance\nadopted under the 1940 Act engage in\ntransactions with another Fund or accounts\nthat are affiliated with a Fund as a result of\ncommon officers, directors, or investment\nadvisers or pursuant to exemptive orders\ngranted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the\nSEC. These transactions would be effected in\ncircumstances in which BlackRock determined\nthat it would be appropriate for a Fund to\npurchase and another client of BlackRock to\nsell, or a Fund to sell and another client of\nBlackRock to purchase, the same security or\ninstrument on the same day. From time to time,\nthe activities of a Fund may be restricted\nbecause of regulatory requirements applicable\nto BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal\npolicies designed to comply with, limit the\napplicability of, or otherwise relate to such\nrequirements. A client not advised by\nBlackRock would not be subject to some of\nthose considerations. There may be periods\nwhen BlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of a Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which a Fund wishes to purchase\nor sell. However, if permitted by applicable\nlaw, and where consistent with BlackRock\u2019s\npolicies and procedures (including the\nnecessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Funds may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Funds. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Funds invest in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or are\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invest in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Funds) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Funds or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Funds), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the\nFunds), may limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Funds),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations. In addition to the\nforegoing, other ownership thresholds may\ntrigger reporting requirements to governmental\nand regulatory authorities, and such reports\nmay entail the disclosure of the identity of a\nclient or BlackRock\u2019s intended strategy with\nrespect to such security or asset. BlackRock\nmay not serve as an Authorized Participant in\nthe creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement, certain Funds\nhave retained BRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to\nperform certain order processing, Authorized\nParticipant communications, and related\nservices in connection with the issuance and\nredemption of Creation\n\n89\n\nUnits of the Funds ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d ). BRIL\nwill retain a portion of the standard\ntransaction fee received from Authorized\nParticipants on each creation or redemption\norder from the Authorized Participant for the\nETF Services provided. BlackRock collaborated\nwith, and received payment from, Citibank,\nN.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d ) on the design and\ndevelopment of the ETF Services platform.\nCitibank may have, or from time to time may\ndevelop, additional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its\naffiliates. BlackRock may maintain securities\nindices. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaws, the Funds may seek to license and use\nsuch indices as part of their investment\nstrategy. Index based funds that seek to track\nthe performance of securities indices also may\nuse the name of the index or index provider in\nthe fund name. Index providers, including\nBlackRock (to the extent permitted by\napplicable law), may be paid licensing fees\nfor use of their index or index name. In\ninstances where BlackRock charges a unitary\nmanagement fee, BlackRock may have a financial\nincentive to use a BlackRock index that is\nless costly to BlackRock than a third party\nindex. BlackRock may benefit from the Funds\nusing BlackRock indices by creating increasing\nacceptance in the marketplace for such\nindices. BlackRock is not obligated to license\nits indices to a Fund and the Funds are under\nno obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any\nFund that enters into a license for a\nBlackRock index cannot be assured that the\nterms of any index licensing agreement with\nBlackRock will be as favorable as those terms\noffered to other licensees. BlackRock may\nenter into contractual arrangements with\nthird-party service providers to a Fund ( e.g.\n, custodians, administrators and index\nproviders) pursuant to which BlackRock\nreceives fee discounts or concessions in\nrecognition of BlackRock\u2019s overall\nrelationship with such service providers.\nBlackRock may also enter into contractual\narrangements with such service providers\npursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional\ncosts if the service provider\u2019s services are\nterminated with respect to a Fund. To the\nextent that BlackRock is responsible for\npaying service providers out of its fees that\nit receives from the Funds, the benefits of\nlower fees, including any fee discounts or\nconcessions, or any additional savings, may\naccrue, in whole or in part, to BlackRock,\nwhich could result in conflicts of interest\nrelating to the use or termination of service\nproviders to a Fund. In addition, conflicts of\ninterest may arise with respect to contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to a Fund, or the selection of such\nproviders, particularly in circumstances where\nBlackRock is negotiating on behalf of both\nfunds that have a unitary management fee and\nthose that do not or different service\nproviders have different fee structures.\nConflicts of interest may arise as a result of\nsimultaneous investment management of multiple\nclient accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s investment\nprofessionals. For example, differences in the\nadvisory fee structure may create the\nappearance of actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest because such differences could create\npecuniary incentives for BlackRock to favor\none client account over another. BlackRock\nowns or has an ownership interest in certain\ntrading, portfolio management, operations\nand/or information systems used by Fund\nservice providers. These systems are, or will\nbe, used by a Fund service provider in\nconnection with the provision of services to\naccounts managed by BlackRock and funds\nmanaged and sponsored by BlackRock, including\nthe Funds, that engage the service provider\n(typically the custodian). A Fund\u2019s service\nprovider remunerates BlackRock for the use of\nthe systems. A Fund service provider\u2019s\npayments to BlackRock for the use of these\nsystems may enhance the profitability of\nBlackRock. BlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a\nservice provider in connection with the use of\nsystems provided by BlackRock may create an\nincentive for BlackRock to recommend that a\nFund enter into or renew an arrangement with\nthe service provider. In recognition of a\nBlackRock client\u2019s overall relationship with\nBlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in a Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock (including BFA), its\ndirectors, officers and employees, in addition\nto those described in this section, may give\nrise to additional conflicts of interest.\n\n90\n\nInvestment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services Investment Adviser. BFA\nserves as investment adviser to each Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and\nBFA. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is\nregistered as an investment adviser under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nUnder the investment advisory agreement, BFA,\nsubject to the supervision of the Board and in\nconformity with the stated investment policies\nof each Fund, manages and administers the\nTrust and the investment of each Fund\u2019s\nassets. BFA is responsible for placing\npurchase and sale orders and providing\ncontinuous supervision of the investment\nportfolio of each Fund. Pursuant to the\ninvestment advisory agreement, BFA may, from\ntime to time, in its sole discretion and to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to the Funds. In addition, BFA\nmay delegate certain of its investment\nadvisory functions under the investment\nadvisory agreement to one or more of its\naffiliates to the extent permitted by\napplicable law. BFA may terminate any or all\nsub-advisers or such delegation arrangements\nin its sole discretion upon appropriate notice\nat any time to the extent permitted by\napplicable law. BFA is responsible, under the\ninvestment advisory agreement, for\nsubstantially all expenses of the Funds,\nincluding the cost of transfer agency,\ncustody, fund administration, legal, audit and\nother services.

As a consequence, from time to\ntime each Fund may receive a smaller\nallocation of an investment opportunity than\nit would have if the Portfolio Managers and\nBFA and its affiliates did not manage other\nportfolios or accounts. Like the Funds, the\nother portfolios or accounts for which the\nPortfolio Managers are primarily responsible\nfor the day-to-day portfolio management\ngenerally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its\naffiliates, as applicable, for its advisory\nservices. One or more of those other\nportfolios or accounts, however, may pay BFA\nor its affiliates a performance-based fee in\nlieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee\nfor its advisory services. A portfolio or\naccount with a performance-based fee would pay\nBFA or its affiliates a portion of that\nportfolio\u2019s or account\u2019s gains, or would pay\nBFA or its affiliates more for its services\nthan would otherwise be the case if BFA or any\nof its affiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Funds should be aware\nthat, as with any group of portfolios and\naccounts managed by an investment adviser\nand/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below show, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of August 31, 2023:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        FeesManaged  Total Assets   \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n                                              \n93\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        FeesManaged  Total Assets   \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        FeesManaged  Total Assets   \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts        Performance   Total Assets  \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1  2,529,000,000  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of August 31, 2023.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance.

JPMorgan maintains\ncustody as may be necessary to facilitate Fund\nsecurities lending activity in coordination\nwith other funds, maintains custodial records\nand provides other services. As compensation\nfor these services, JPMorgan receives certain\nfees and expenses paid by BTC from its\ncompensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Distributor. The Distributor's\nprincipal address is 50 Hudson Yards, New\nYork, NY 10001. Shares are continuously\noffered for sale by the Funds through the\nDistributor or its agent only in Creation\nUnits, as described in the applicable\nProspectus and below in the Creation and\nRedemption of Creation Units section of this\nSAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits are generally not distributed by the\nDistributor or its agent. The Distributor or\nits agent will arrange for the delivery of the\napplicable Prospectus and, upon request, this\nSAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and\nwill maintain records of both orders placed\nwith it or its agents and confirmations of\nacceptance furnished by it or its agents. The\nDistributor is a broker-dealer registered\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,\nInc. ( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor is also\nlicensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S.\nstates, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands and the District of Columbia.\nThe Distribution Agreement for each Fund\nprovides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii)\nthe vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the relevant Fund.

The Distributor may also enter into\nagreements with securities dealers ( \u201c\nSoliciting Dealers \u201d ) who will solicit\npurchases of Creation Units of Fund shares.\nSuch Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized\nParticipants (as described below), DTC\nparticipants and/or investor services\norganizations. BFA or its affiliates may, from\ntime to time and from its own resources, pay,\ndefray or absorb costs relating to\ndistribution, including payments out of its\nown resources to the Distributor, or to\notherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that a Fund\nengages in securities lending, each Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Funds,\nsubject to the overall supervision of BFA,\npursuant to a written agreement (the \u201c\nSecurities Lending Agency Agreement \u201d ). Each\nFund retains a portion of the securities\nlending income and remits the remaining\nportion to BTC as compensation for its\nservices as securities lending agent.\nSecurities lending income is generally equal\nto the total of income earned from the\nreinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes\ncollateral investment fees as defined below),\nand any fees or other payments to and from\nborrowers of securities. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each\nFund is responsible for fees in connection\nwith the investment of cash collateral\nreceived for securities on loan in a money\nmarket fund managed by BFA (the \u201c collateral\ninvestment fees \u201d ); however, BTC has agreed\nto reduce the amount of securities lending\nincome it receives in order to effectively\nlimit the collateral investment fees the Fund\nbears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money\nmarket fund shares will not be subject to a\nsales load, redemption fee, distribution fee\nor service fee. Under the securities lending\nprogram, the Funds are categorized into one of\nseveral specific asset classes. The\ndetermination of a Fund\u2019s asset class category\n(fixed-income, domestic equity, international\nequity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be\nsubject to a different fee arrangement, is\nbased on a methodology agreed to by the Trust\nand BTC.

The services provided to the\nFunds by BTC in the most recent fiscal year\nended August 31, 2023 primarily included the\nfollowing: (1) selecting borrowers from an\napproved list of borrowers and executing a\nsecurities lending agreement as agent on\nbehalf of the Funds with each such borrower;\n(2) negotiating the terms of securities loans,\nincluding the amount of fees; (3) directing\nthe delivery of loaned securities; (4)\nmonitoring the daily value of the loaned\nsecurities and directing the payment of\nadditional collateral or the return of excess\ncollateral, as necessary; (5) investing cash\ncollateral received in connection with any\nloaned securities; (6) monitoring\ndistributions on loaned securities (for\nexample, interest and dividend activity); (7)\nin the event of default by a borrower with\nrespect to any securities loan, using the\ncollateral or the proceeds of the liquidation\nof collateral to purchase replacement\nsecurities of the same issue, type, class and\nseries as that of the loaned securities; and\n(8) terminating securities loans and arranging\nfor the return of loaned securities to the\nFunds at loan termination.

     \nPayments by BFA and its Affiliates. BFA and/or\nits affiliates ( \u201c BFA Entities \u201d ) may pay\ncertain broker-dealers, registered investment\nadvisers, banks and other financial\nintermediaries ( \u201c Intermediaries \u201d ) for\ncertain activities related to the Funds, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products in\ngeneral. BFA Entities make these payments from\ntheir own assets and not from the assets of\nthe Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities\u2019\nrevenue comes directly or indirectly in part\nfrom fees paid by the Funds, other iShares\nfunds (including, if applicable, any\nunderlying iShares funds held by a Fund) or\nexchange-traded products, these payments do\nnot increase the price paid by investors for\nthe purchase of shares of, or the cost of\nowning, the Funds, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products. BFA Entities make\npayments for Intermediaries\u2019 participation in\nactivities that are designed to make\nregistered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Funds and other iShares funds,\nor for other activities, such as participation\nin marketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Funds,\nother iShares funds or exchange-traded\nproducts ( \u201c Publishing Costs \u201d ). In\naddition, BFA Entities make payments to\nIntermediaries that make shares of the Funds,\nother iShares funds or exchange-traded\nproducts available to their clients, in some\ncases at a waived or reduced commission rate\nor ticket charge, develop new products that\nfeature iShares, create educational content\nabout the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products that is featured on\nan Intermediary\u2019s platform, or otherwise\npromote the Funds, other iShares funds and\nexchange-traded products. BFA Entities may\nalso reimburse expenses or make payments from\ntheir own assets to Intermediaries or other\npersons in consideration of services or other\nactivities that the BFA Entities believe may\nbenefit the iShares business or facilitate\ninvestment in the Funds, other iShares funds\nor exchange-traded products. Payments of the\ntype described above are sometimes referred to\nas revenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its\n\n105\n\nclients. These financial incentives may cause\nthe Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products, or\notherwise promote the Fund, other iShares\nfunds or exchange-traded products over other\ninvestments. The same conflicts of interest\nand financial incentives exist with respect to\nyour salesperson or other investment\nprofessional if he or she receives similar\npayments from his or her Intermediary firm. In\naddition to the payments described above, BFA\nEntities have developed proprietary tools,\ncalculators and related interactive or digital\ncontent that is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Funds, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream\nFund Centre AG, Commonwealth Equity Services,\nLLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC,\nE*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset\nManagement, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc.,\nLPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\nFenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley\nSmith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual\nInvestment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio\nSolutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public Holdings,\nInc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.,\nRiskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC,\nStash Investments LLC, TD Ameritrade, Inc.,\nUBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo\nAdvisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFunds, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Funds, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Funds may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Funds would pay a\nfee to the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity\nand quality of the secondary market of\nsecurities of a Fund. The fee would then\n\n106\n\nbe credited by the exchange to one or more\nmarket makers that meet or exceed liquidity\nand market quality standards with respect to\nthe securities of a Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of a\nFund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will\nnot be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds\nmanaged by BFA may also participate in such\nprograms. Determination of Net Asset Value\nValuation of Shares. The NAV for each Fund is\ngenerally calculated as of the close of\nregular trading hours on the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is\nopen. Valuation of assets held by a Fund is as\nfollows: Equity Investments. Equity securities\ntraded on a recognized securities exchange (\ne.g. , NYSE), on separate trading boards of a\nsecurities exchange or through a market system\nthat provides contemporaneous transaction\npricing information (each an \u201c Exchange \u201d )\nare valued using information obtained via\nindependent pricing services, generally at the\nclosing price or, if an Exchange closing price\nis not available, the last traded price on\nthat Exchange prior to the time as of which\nthe assets or liabilities are valued. However,\nunder certain circumstances, other means of\ndetermining current market value may be used.\nIf an equity security is traded on more than\none Exchange, the current market value of the\nsecurity where it is primarily traded\ngenerally will be used. In the event that\nthere are no sales involving an equity\nsecurity held by a Fund on a day on which a\nFund values such security, the prior day\u2019s\nprice will be used, unless BFA determines that\nsuch prior day\u2019s price no longer reflects the\nfair value of the security, in which case such\nasset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset\n(as defined below). Options, Futures, Swaps\nand Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded equity\noptions (except those that are customized) for\nwhich market quotations are readily available\nare valued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values\nsuch option, the last bid (long positions) or\nask (short positions) price, if available,\nwill be used as the value of such option. If\nno bid or ask price is available on a day on\nwhich a Fund values such option, the prior\nday\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value a Fund\u2019s securities and other\nassets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time a Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich a Fund valued such security, the revised\npricing service quotation generally will be\napplied prospectively. Such determination will\nbe made considering pertinent facts and\ncircumstances surrounding the revision. The\nprice a Fund could receive upon the sale of\nany particular portfolio investment may differ\nfrom a Fund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for assets that trade in thin or\nvolatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation methodology or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. As a\nresult, the price received upon the sale of an\ninvestment may be less than the value ascribed\nby a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund\u2019s\nability to value its investment may also be\nimpacted by technological issues and/or errors\nby pricing services or other third-party\nservice providers. All cash, receivables and\ncurrent payables are carried on a Fund\u2019s books\nat their fair value. In the event that\napplication of the methods of valuation\ndiscussed above result in a price for a\nsecurity which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, each Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by a Fund (including\nrestricted\n\n107\n\nsecurities) are valued at fair value as\ndetermined in good faith by BFA pursuant to\nthe Valuation Procedures. Any assets and\nliabilities which are denominated in a foreign\ncurrency are translated into U.S. dollars at\nthe prevailing market rates. Use of fair value\nprices and certain current market valuations\ncould result in a difference between the\nprices used to calculate a Fund\u2019s NAV and the\nprices used in its Underlying Index, which, in\nturn, could result in a difference between a\nFund\u2019s performance and the performance of its\nUnderlying Index. Fair Value. When market\nquotations are not readily available or are\nbelieved by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are valued at fair value ( \u201c Fair\nValue Assets \u201d ). Fair Value Assets are valued\nby BFA in accordance with the Valuation\nProcedures. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the\nInvestment Company Act, the Board of Trustees\nhas designated BFA as the valuation designee\nfor the respective Funds for which it serves\nas investment adviser. BFA may reasonably\nconclude that a market quotation is not\nreadily available or is unreliable if, among\nother things, a security or other asset or\nliability does not have a price source due to\nits complete lack of trading, if BFA believes\na market quotation from a broker-dealer or\nother source is unreliable ( e.g. , where it\nvaries significantly from a recent trade, or\nno longer reflects the fair value of the\nsecurity or other asset or liability\nsubsequent to the most recent market\nquotation), or where the security or other\nasset or liability is only thinly traded or\ndue to the occurrence of a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent market\nquotation. For this purpose, a \u201c significant\nevent \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA determines,\nin its reasonable business judgment, that an\nevent has occurred after the close of trading\nfor an asset or liability but prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u2019s assets or\nliabilities, is likely to cause a material\nchange to the last exchange closing price or\nclosing market price of one or more assets\nheld by, or liabilities of, a Fund. On any day\nthe NYSE is open and a foreign market or the\nprimary exchange on which a foreign asset or\nliability is traded is closed, such asset or\nliability will be valued using the prior day\u2019s\nprice, provided that BFA is not aware of any\nsignificant event or other information that\nwould cause such price to no longer reflect\nthe fair value of the asset or liability, in\nwhich case such asset or liability would be\ntreated as a Fair Value Asset. For certain\nforeign assets, a third-party vendor supplies\nevaluated, systematic fair value pricing based\nupon the movement of a proprietary multi-\nfactor model after the relevant foreign\nmarkets have closed. This systematic fair\nvalue pricing methodology is designed to\ncorrelate the prices of foreign assets in one\nor more non-U.S. markets following the close\nof the local markets to the prices that might\nhave prevailed as of a Fund\u2019s pricing time.\nBFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for\nreviewing and approving methodologies by\ninvestment type and significant inputs used in\nthe fair valuation of Fund assets or\nliabilities. In addition, a Fund\u2019s accounting\nagent assists BFA by periodically endeavoring\nto confirm the prices it receives from all\nthird-party pricing services, index providers\nand broker-dealers and regularly evaluating\nthe values assigned to the securities and\nother assets and liabilities of a Fund. The\npricing of all Fair Value Assets is\nsubsequently reported to the Board or a\ncommittee thereof. When determining the price\nfor a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to\ndetermine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on which\nthe asset or liability is being valued, and\ndoes not seek to determine the price a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair\nvalue determinations will be based upon all\navailable factors that BFA deems relevant at\nthe time of the determination, and may be\nbased on analytical values determined by BFA\nusing proprietary or third-party valuation\nmodels. Fair value represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. When determining the fair value of\nan investment, one or more fair value\nmethodologies may be used (depending on\ncertain factors, including the asset type).\nFor example, the investment may be initially\npriced based on the original cost of the\ninvestment or, alternatively, using\nproprietary or third-party models that may\nrely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining a Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, a Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nEach Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial\n\n108\n\nAccounting Standards Board Accounting\nStandards Codification Topic 820, \u201c Fair Value\nMeasurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c ASC 820 \u201d\n), which defines and establishes a framework\nfor measuring fair value under US GAAP and\nexpands financial statement disclosure\nrequirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect a\nFund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to a Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Funds,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, a Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including a\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause a Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for a Fund and may take into account\na variety of factors including: (i) the size,\nnature and character of the security or\ninstrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time, a\nFund may purchase new issues of securities in\na fixed price offering. In these situations,\nthe broker may be a member of the selling\ngroup that will, in addition to selling\nsecurities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). The\nFunds anticipate that brokerage transactions\ninvolving foreign equity securities generally\nwill be conducted primarily on the principal\nstock exchanges of the applicable country.\nForeign equity securities may be held by the\nFunds in the form of depositary receipts, or\nother securities convertible into foreign\nequity securities. Depositary receipts may be\nlisted on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC\nmarkets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may\nbe. ADRs, like other securities traded in the\nU.S., will be subject to negotiated commission\nrates. OTC issues, including most fixed-income\nsecurities such as corporate debt and U.S.\nGovernment securities, are normally traded on\na \u201c net \u201d basis without a stated commission,\nthrough dealers acting for their own account\nand not as brokers. The Funds will primarily\nengage in transactions with these dealers or\ndeal directly with the issuer unless a better\nprice or execution could be obtained by using\na broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities\n\n109\n\nwill generally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is\nthe difference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit. Under the 1940\nAct, persons affiliated with a Fund and\npersons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the dealers\nacting as principal for their own accounts,\nthe Funds will not deal with affiliated\npersons and affiliated persons of such\naffiliated persons in connection with such\ntransactions. The Funds will not purchase\nsecurities during the existence of any\nunderwriting or selling group relating to such\nsecurities of which BFA, BRIL or any\naffiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nthereof is a member except pursuant to\nprocedures adopted by the Board in accordance\nwith Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act. Purchases\nof money market instruments by the Funds are\nmade from dealers, underwriters and issuers.\nThe Funds do not currently expect to incur any\nbrokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Funds with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Funds\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. Initial public\nofferings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of securities may be\nover-subscribed and subsequently trade at a\npremium in the secondary market. When BFA is\ngiven an opportunity to invest in such an\ninitial offering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue,\nthe supply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in a Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as\n\n110\n\nthe rotation system provides for fair access\nfor all client accounts over time. Other\nallocation methodologies that are considered\nby BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may\nbe used as well. Because different accounts\nmay have differing investment objectives and\npolicies, BFA may buy and sell the same\nsecurities at the same time for different\nclients based on the particular investment\nobjective, guidelines and strategies of those\naccounts. For example, BFA may decide that it\nmay be entirely appropriate for a growth fund\nto sell a security at the same time a value\nfund is buying that security. To the extent\nthat transactions on behalf of more than one\nclient of BFA or the other Affiliates during\nthe same period increase the demand for\nsecurities being purchased or the supply of\nsecurities being sold, there may be an adverse\neffect on price. For example, sales of a\nsecurity by BlackRock on behalf of one or more\nof its clients may decrease the market price\nof such security, adversely impacting other\nBlackRock clients that still hold the\nsecurity. If purchases or sales of securities\narise for consideration at or about the same\ntime that would involve the Funds or other\nclients or funds for which BFA or another\nAffiliate act as investment manager,\ntransactions in such securities will be made,\ninsofar as feasible, for the respective funds\nand clients in a manner deemed equitable to\nall. In certain instances, BFA may find it\nefficient for purposes of seeking to obtain\nbest execution, to aggregate or \u201c bunch \u201d\ncertain contemporaneous purchases or sale\norders of its advisory accounts and advisory\naccounts of affiliates. In general, all\ncontemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Funds are\nconcerned, in other cases it could be\nbeneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected\nby BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of\nmore than one of its clients during the same\nperiod may increase the demand for securities\nbeing purchased or the supply of securities\nbeing sold, causing an adverse effect on\nprice. The trader will give the bunched order\nto the broker-dealer that the trader has\nidentified as being able to provide the best\nexecution of the order. Orders for purchase or\nsale of securities will be placed within a\nreasonable amount of time of the order receipt\nand bunched orders will be kept bunched only\nlong enough to execute the order. The table\nbelow sets forth the brokerage commissions\npaid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted.\nAny differences in brokerage commissions paid\nby a Fund from year to year are principally\ndue to increases or decreases in that Fund\u2019s\nassets over those periods or the magnitude of\nchanges to the components of a Fund's\nUnderlying Index:\n                                              \n

an affiliate of BFA, or\nto any other broker-dealer that is part of the\nBlackRock group of companies, during the\nfiscal year ended August 31, 2023. The Funds'\npurchase and sale orders for securities may be\ncombined with those of other investment\ncompanies, clients or accounts that BlackRock\nmanages or advises. If purchases or sales of\nportfolio securities of the Funds and one or\nmore other accounts managed or advised by\nBlackRock are considered at or about the same\ntime, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Funds and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Funds\nare concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFunds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest\nfor its own account in the types of securities\nin which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may,\nfrom time to time, effect trades on behalf of\nand for the account of the Funds with brokers\nor dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Funds\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses.

Additional Information\nConcerning the Trust Shares. The Trust issues\nshares of beneficial interests in the funds\nwith no par value. The Board may designate\nadditional iShares funds. Each share issued by\na fund has a pro rata interest in the assets\nof that fund. Shares have no preemptive,\nexchange, subscription or conversion rights\nand are freely transferable. Each share is\nentitled to participate equally in dividends\nand distributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the relevant fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of such fund on\nliquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Following the creation of the\ninitial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund\nand immediately prior to the commencement of\ntrading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more\nthan 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject\nto the reporting provisions of Section 13 of\nthe 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould consult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff. In accordance with\nthe Trust's current Agreement and Declaration\nof Trust (the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the\nBoard may, without shareholder approval\n(unless such shareholder approval is required\nby the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power\n\n114\n\nto alter the number of shares in a Creation\nUnit. Therefore, in the event of a termination\nof the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Funds. Shares of\neach Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of each\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of each Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with each Fund's\nlaunch, each Fund was seeded through the sale\nof one or more Creation Units by each Fund to\none or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof each Fund or each Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\n\n115\n\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor each Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nEach Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\neach Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund\u2019s NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the applicable Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, the Funds may\nrequire orders to be placed earlier in the\nday.

A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\neach Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. Each Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\neach Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of a Fund generally\nconsists of Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent computed as described below.\nTogether, the Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent constitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d\nwhich when combined with the Fund's portfolio\nsecurities, is designed to generate\nperformance that has a collective investment\nprofile similar to that of the Underlying\nIndex. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum\ninitial and subsequent investment amount for a\nCreation Unit of any Fund. Such Fund Deposit\nis applicable, subject to any adjustments as\ndescribed below, to purchases of Creation\nUnits of shares of a given Fund until such\ntime as the next-announced Fund Deposit is\nmade available. The Cash Component is an\namount equal to the difference between the NAV\nof the shares (per Creation Unit) and the \u201c\nDeposit Amount, \u201d which is an amount equal to\nthe market value of the Deposit Securities,\nand serves to compensate for any differences\nbetween the NAV per Creation Unit and the\nDeposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities are the sole responsibility\nof the Authorized Participant purchasing a\nCreation Unit. The identity and number of\nshares of the Deposit Securities change\npursuant to changes in the composition of a\nFund's portfolio and as rebalancing\nadjustments and corporate action events are\nreflected from time to time by BFA with a view\nto the investment objective of the Fund. The\ncomposition of the Deposit Securities may also\nchange in response to adjustments to the\nweighting or composition of the component\nsecurities constituting the relevant\nUnderlying Index. The Fund Deposit may also be\nmodified to minimize the Cash Component by\nredistributing the cash to the Deposit\nSecurities portion of the Fund Deposit through\n\u201c systematic rounding. \u201d The rounding\nmethodology \u201c rounds up \u201d position sizes of\nsecurities in the Deposit Securities (which in\nturn reduces the cash portion). However, the\nmethodology limits the maximum allowed\npercentage change in weight and share quantity\nof any given security in the Fund Deposit.\nFund Deposits may also be modified to position\na fund towards a forward index rebalance to\nreflect revisions that account for index\nadditions, deletions, and re-weights. The\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the\nCash Component to replace any Deposit Security\nin certain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit partial or full cash purchases of\nCreation Units of its funds, when partial or\nfull cash purchases of Creation Units are\navailable or specified for a Fund, they will\nbe effected in essentially the same manner as\nin-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a\npartial or full cash purchase, the Authorized\nParticipant must pay the cash equivalent of\nthe Deposit Securities it would otherwise be\nrequired to provide through an in-kind\npurchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Funds, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a\n\n117\n\nclearing agency registered with the SEC which\nhas a written agreement with the Funds or one\nof their service providers that allows such\nmember or participant to place orders for the\npurchase and redemption of Creation Units is\nreferred to as an \u201c Authorized Participant. \u201d\nAll shares of the Funds, however created, will\nbe entered on the records of DTC in the name\nof Cede & Co. for the account of a DTC\nParticipant. Role of the Authorized\nParticipant. Creation Units may be purchased\nonly by or through a member or participant of\na clearing agency registered with the SEC,\nwhich has a written agreement with the Funds\nor one of their service providers that allows\nsuch member or participant to place orders for\nthe purchase and redemption of Creation Units\n(an \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ). Such\nAuthorized Participant will agree, pursuant to\nthe terms of such Authorized Participant\nAgreement and on behalf of itself or any\ninvestor on whose behalf it will act, to\ncertain conditions, including that such\nAuthorized Participant will make available in\nadvance of each purchase of shares an amount\nof cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component,\nonce the NAV of a Creation Unit is next\ndetermined after receipt of the purchase order\nin proper form, together with the transaction\nfees described below. An Authorized\nParticipant, acting on behalf of an investor,\nmay require the investor to enter into an\nagreement with such Authorized Participant\nwith respect to certain matters, including\npayment of the Cash Component. Investors who\nare not Authorized Participants must make\nappropriate arrangements with an Authorized\nParticipant. Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not be a DTC\nParticipant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\nAuthorized Participant. As a result, purchase\norders placed through an Authorized\nParticipant may result in additional charges\nto such investor. The Trust does not expect to\nenter into an Authorized Participant Agreement\nwith more than a small number of DTC\nParticipants. A list of current Authorized\nParticipants may be obtained from the\nDistributor. The Distributor has adopted\nguidelines regarding Authorized Participants\u2019\ntransactions in Creation Units that are made\navailable to all Authorized Participants.\nThese guidelines set forth the processes and\nstandards for Authorized Participants to\ntransact with the Distributor and its agents\nin connection with creation and redemption\ntransactions. In addition, the Distributor may\nbe appointed as the proxy of the Authorized\nParticipant and may be granted a power of\nattorney under its Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Purchase Orders. To initiate an\norder for a Creation Unit, an Authorized\nParticipant must submit to the Distributor or\nits agent an irrevocable order to purchase\nshares of a Fund, in proper form, generally\nbefore 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business\nDay to receive that day\u2019s NAV. The Distributor\nor its agent will notify BFA and the custodian\nof such order. The custodian will then provide\nsuch information to any appropriate sub-\ncustodian. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning the delivery of the Fund Deposit are\nset forth in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time. Investors, other than Authorized\nParticipants, are responsible for making\narrangements for a creation request to be made\nthrough an Authorized Participant. The\nDistributor or its agent will provide a list\nof current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFunds, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\napplicable deadline for cash transfers by\ncontacting the operations department of the\nbroker or depositary institution effectuating\nthe transfer of the Cash Component. This\ndeadline is likely to be significantly earlier\nthan the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors\nshould be aware that an Authorized Participant\nmay require orders for purchases of shares\nplaced with it to be in the particular form\nrequired by the individual Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant is\nresponsible for any and all expenses and costs\nincurred by a Fund, including any applicable\ncash amounts, in connection with any purchase\norder. Timing of Submission of Purchase\nOrders. An Authorized Participant must submit\nan irrevocable order to purchase shares of a\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Funds to the Distributor or\nits agent pursuant to procedures set forth in\nthe Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic\nor market disruptions or changes, or telephone\nor other communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. Orders to create\nshares of a Fund that are submitted on the\nBusiness Day immediately preceding a holiday\nor a day (other than a weekend) when the\nequity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market\nare closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as that Fund's\n\u201c Cutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\n\n118\n\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with a\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Funds are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFunds will accept the order, subject to each\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once a Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. Each Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, a Fund may reject or revoke a\ncreation order transmitted to it by the\nDistributor or its agent if (i) the order is\nnot in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding shares of\nthe Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not conform to the identity and\nnumber of shares specified, as described\nabove; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit\nSecurities is not legally required or would,\nin the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; or (v)\ncircumstances outside the control of the Fund,\nthe Distributor or its agent and BFA make it\nimpracticable to process purchase orders. The\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a\nprospective purchaser of a Creation Unit\nand/or the Authorized Participant acting on\nbehalf of such purchaser of its rejection of\nsuch order. The Funds, State Street or\nCitibank, as applicable, the sub-custodian and\nthe Distributor or its agent are under no\nduty, however, to give notification of any\ndefects or irregularities in the delivery of\nFund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any\nliability for failure to give such\nnotification. Issuance of a Creation Unit.\nExcept as provided herein, a Creation Unit\nwill not be issued until the transfer of good\ntitle to the applicable Fund of the Deposit\nSecurities and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the sub-\ncustodian has confirmed to the custodian that\nthe securities included in the Fund Deposit\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant sub-\ncustodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor\nor its agent and BFA shall be notified of such\ndelivery and the applicable Fund will issue\nand cause the delivery of the Creation Unit.\nFor the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF,\niShares MSCI Denmark ETF, iShares MSCI\nIndonesia ETF, iShares MSCI Japan Value ETF,\niShares MSCI New Zealand ETF, iShares MSCI\nNorway ETF, iShares MSCI Philippines ETF,\niShares MSCI Poland ETF, iShares MSCI United\nKingdom ETF and iShares MSCI United Kingdom\nSmall-Cap ETF, Creation Units are generally\nissued on a \u201c T+1 basis \u201d ( i.e. , one\nBusiness Day after trade date). For all other\nFunds in this SAI, Creation Units are\ngenerally issued on a \u201c T+2 basis \u201d ( i.e. ,\ntwo Business Days after trade date). However,\neach Fund reserves the right to settle\nCreation Unit transactions on a different\nbasis, including a shorter settlement period,\nif necessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. These circumstances may include, among\nothers, accommodating non-U.S. market holiday\nschedules and accounting for different\ntreatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of\ndividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (\ni.e. , the last day the holder of a security\ncan sell the security and still receive\ndividends payable on the security). To the\nextent contemplated by an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement with the Distributor,\neach Fund will issue Creation Units to such\nAuthorized Participant, notwithstanding the\nfact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have\nnot been received in part or in whole, in\nreliance on the undertaking of the Authorized\nParticipant to deliver the missing Deposit\nSecurities as soon as possible, which\nundertaking shall be secured by such\nAuthorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\nbuy Deposit Securities for the Funds. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by a Fund or its custodian on\nthe contractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Funds' current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Funds to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Funds of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges.\n\n119\n\nIn certain cases, Authorized Participants may\ncreate and redeem Creation Units on the same\ntrade date and in these instances, the Funds\nreserve the right to settle these transactions\non a net basis or require a representation\nfrom the Authorized Participants that the\ncreation and redemption transactions are for\nseparate beneficial owners. All questions as\nto the number of shares of each security in\nthe Deposit Securities and the validity, form,\neligibility and acceptance for deposit of any\nsecurities to be delivered shall be determined\nby each Fund and the Fund's determination\nshall be final and binding. Costs Associated\nwith Creation Transactions. All Funds (except\niShares Climate Conscious & Transition MSCI\nUSA ETF, iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF,\niShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG\nAware MSCI USA Growth ETF, iShares ESG Aware\nMSCI USA Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI\nUSA Value ETF, iShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders\nETF and iShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA\nETF ) A standard creation transaction fee is\nimposed to offset the transfer and other\ntransaction costs associated with the issuance\nof Creation Units. The standard creation\ntransaction fee is charged to the Authorized\nParticipant on the day such Authorized\nParticipant creates a Creation Unit, and is\nthe same, regardless of the number of Creation\nUnits purchased by the Authorized Participant\non the applicable Business Day. If a purchase\nconsists solely or partially of cash, the\nAuthorized Participant may also be required to\ncover (up to the maximum amount shown below)\ncertain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange,\nexecution, price movement and other costs and\nexpenses related to the execution of trades\nresulting from such transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs).

The ETF\nServicing Fee is a flat fee per order\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing purchased, which amount will vary among\ndifferent Funds based on a number of factors,\nincluding the complexity of the order and the\ntypes of securities or instruments included in\na Fund's Creation Basket, among other\nvariables. The actual Custody Transaction\nCosts vary per order based on the number of\ntrades, underlying markets and settlement\nlocations associated with the issuance of a\nCreation Unit. The following table sets forth,\nfor each Fund, either the actual creation\ntransaction fee that was charged on November\n30, 2023 or an estimate of the creation\ntransaction fee that would have been charged\nif the Fund had issued a Creation Unit on that\ndate. The actual fee that was or would have\nbeen charged to an Authorized Participant in\nconnection with a creation order will vary\nover time depending on the factors discussed\nabove, and may be higher than the fee set\nforth below. If a purchase consists solely or\npartially of cash, the Authorized Participant\nmay also be required to cover (up to the\nmaximum amount shown below) certain brokerage,\ntax, foreign exchange, execution, price\nmovement and other costs and expenses related\nto the execution of trades resulting from such\ntransaction (which may, in certain instances,\nbe based on a good faith estimate of\ntransaction costs).

Redemption of\nCreation Units. Shares of a Fund may be\nredeemed by Authorized Participants only in\nCreation Units at their NAV next determined\nafter receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form by the Distributor or its agent\nand only on a Business Day. The Funds will not\nredeem shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits. There can be no assurance, however,\nthat there will be sufficient liquidity in the\nsecondary market at any time to permit\nassembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should\nexpect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number\nof shares to constitute a Creation Unit that\ncould be redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant. Beneficial owners also may sell\nshares in the secondary market. Each Fund\ngenerally redeems Creation Units for Fund\nSecurities (as defined below). Please see the\nCash Redemption Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the in-kind\nmethod for further information on redeeming\nCreation Units of the Funds. Each Fund\npublishes the designated portfolio of\nsecurities (including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be substituted)\nthat will be applicable to redemption requests\nreceived in proper form (as defined below) on\nthat day ( \u201c Fund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption\nBasket \u201d ), and an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash\nAmount, \u201d as described below) in order to\neffect redemptions of Creation Units of a\nFund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount\nwill remain in effect until such time as the\n\n121\n\nnext announced composition of the Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount is made available.\nThe Fund Securities and Cash Amount are\nsubject to possible amendment or correction.\nFund Securities received on redemption may not\nbe identical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Unless cash\nredemptions are available or specified for a\nFund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit generally consist of Fund Securities,\nplus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal\nto the difference between the NAV of the\nshares being redeemed, as next determined\nafter the receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form, and the value of Fund Securities,\nless a redemption transaction fee (as\ndescribed below). The Trust may, in its sole\ndiscretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally\nredeems Creation Units for Fund Securities,\nbut the Fund reserves the right to utilize a\ncash option for redemption of Creation Units.\nEach Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide\nsuch redeeming Authorized Participant a\nportfolio of securities that differs from the\nexact composition of the Fund Securities, but\ndoes not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket\nmay also be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index rebalance to reflect revisions\nthat account for index additions, deletions,\nand re-weights. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\npartial or full cash redemptions of Creation\nUnits of its funds, when partial or full cash\nredemptions of Creation Units are available or\nspecified for a Fund, they will be effected in\nessentially the same manner as in-kind\nredemptions thereof. In the case of partial or\nfull cash redemption, the Authorized\nParticipant receives the cash equivalent of\nthe Fund Securities it would otherwise receive\nthrough an in-kind redemption, plus the same\nCash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\nAll Funds (except iShares Climate Conscious &\nTransition MSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG Advanced\nMSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF,\niShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Growth ETF, iShares\nESG Aware MSCI USA Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG\nAware MSCI USA Value ETF, iShares ESG MSCI USA\nLeaders ETF and iShares Paris-Aligned Climate\nMSCI USA ETF) A standard redemption\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset transfer\nand other transaction costs that may be\nincurred by the relevant Fund. The standard\nredemption transaction fee is charged to the\nAuthorized Participant on the day such\nAuthorized Participant redeems a Creation\nUnit, and is the same regardless of the number\nof Creation Units redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant on the applicable Business Day. If\na redemption consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution, price movement and other\ncosts and expenses related to the execution of\ntrades resulting from such transaction (which\nmay, in certain instances, be based on a good\nfaith estimate of transaction costs).\nAuthorized Participants will also bear the\ncosts of transferring the Fund Securities from\na Fund to their account on their order.\nCertain fees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances.

BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF\nServicing Fee pursuant to the ETF Services\nAgreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody\nTransaction Costs to the applicable Fund\ncustodian according to the amounts invoiced by\nsuch custodian. The ETF Servicing Fee is a\nflat fee per order regardless of the number of\nCreation Units being redeemed, which amount\nwill vary among different Funds based on a\nnumber of factors, including the complexity of\nthe order and the types of securities or\ninstruments included in a Fund's Redemption\nBasket, among other variables. The actual\nCustody Transaction Costs vary per order based\non the number of trades, underlying markets,\nand settlement locations associated with the\nredemption of a Creation Unit. The following\ntable sets forth, for each Fund, either the\nactual redemption transaction fee that was\ncharged on November 30, 2023 or an estimate of\nthe redemption transaction fee that would have\nbeen charged if the Fund had redeemed a\nCreation Unit on that date. The actual fee\nthat was or would have been charged to an\nAuthorized Participant in connection with a\nredemption order will vary over time depending\non the factors discussed above, and may be\nhigher than the fee set forth below. If a\nredemption consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution, price movement and other\ncosts and expenses related to the execution of\ntrades resulting from such transaction (which\nmay, in certain instances, be based on a good\nfaith estimate of transaction costs).\nAuthorized Participants will also bear the\ncosts of transferring the Fund Securities from\na Fund to their account on their order.\nCertain fees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\ndispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee\nfor such services. The following table sets\nforth each Fund\u2019s actual or estimated\nredemption transaction fee, as applicable, as\nof November 30, 2023 and maximum additional\ncharge (as described above):\n                                              \n                Standard       Maximum        \n  Fund          RedemptionTr\u2026  AdditionalCh\u2026  \n                Fee                           \n  iShares                                     \n  Climate                                     \n  Conscious &   $533.75**      2.0%           \n  Transition                                  \n  MSCI USA ETF                                \n  iShares ESG                                 \n  Advanced      611.25**       2.0%           \n  MSCI USA ETF                                \n                                              \n123\n                                              \n                     Standard  Maximum        \n  Fund          RedemptionTr\u2026  AdditionalCh\u2026  \n                          Fee                 \n  iShares ESG                                 \n  Aware MSCI         520.00**  2.0%           \n  USA ETF                                     \n  iShares ESG                                 \n  Aware MSCI         293.75**  2.0%           \n  USA Growth                                  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares ESG                                 \n  Aware MSCI                                  \n  USA               1263.75**  2.0%           \n  Small-Cap                                   \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares ESG                                 \n  Aware MSCI         427.50**  2.0%           \n  USA Value                                   \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares ESG                                 \n  MSCI USA           500.00**  2.0%           \n  Leaders ETF                                 \n  iShares                                     \n  Paris-Align\u2026                                \n  Climate MSCI         473.75  2.0%           \n  USA                                         \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\nredemption transaction fee. ** Estimated fee.\nPlacement of Redemption Orders. Redemption\nrequests for Creation Units of the Funds must\nbe submitted to the Distributor or its agent\nby or through an Authorized Participant. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable request to redeem shares of a Fund\ngenerally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on\nany Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, a Fund may require\norders to redeem Creation Units to be placed\nearlier that day. Investors, other than\nAuthorized Participants, are responsible for\nmaking arrangements for a redemption request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. The Authorized Participant must\ntransmit the request for redemption in the\nform required by the Funds to the Distributor\nor its agent in accordance with procedures set\nforth in the Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that,\ntherefore, requests to redeem Creation Units\nmay have to be placed by the investor's broker\nthrough an Authorized Participant who has\nexecuted an Authorized Participant Agreement.\nAt any time, only a limited number of broker-\ndealers will have an Authorized Participant\nAgreement in effect. Investors making a\nredemption request should be aware that such\nrequest must be in the form specified by such\nAuthorized Participant. Investors making a\nrequest to redeem Creation Units should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe request by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Funds'\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the applicable\nFund is received by the Distributor or its\nagent from the Authorized Participant on\nbehalf of itself or another redeeming investor\nwithin the time periods specified above; and\n(iii) all other procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement are properly\nfollowed. Upon receiving a redemption request,\nthe Distributor or its agent shall notify the\napplicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent\nof such redemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. For the iShares ESG Aware\nMSCI USA ETF, iShares MSCI Denmark ETF,\niShares MSCI Indonesia ETF, iShares MSCI Japan\nValue ETF, iShares MSCI New Zealand ETF,\niShares MSCI Norway ETF, iShares MSCI\nPhilippines ETF, iShares MSCI Poland ETF,\niShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF and iShares\nMSCI United Kingdom Small-Cap ETF, deliveries\nof redemption proceeds are generally made\nwithin one Business Day ( i.e. , \u201c T+1 \u201d ).\nFor all other Funds in this SAI, deliveries of\nredemption proceeds are generally made within\ntwo Business Days ( i.e. , \u201c T+2 \u201d ). However,\neach Fund reserves the right to settle\ndeliveries of redemption proceeds on a\ndifferent basis, if necessary or appropriate\nunder the circumstances and compliant with\napplicable law. These circumstances may\ninclude, among others, accommodating non-U.S.\nmarket holiday schedules and accounting\n\n124\n\nfor different treatment among non-U.S. and\nU.S. markets of dividend record dates and\ndividend ex-dates ( i.e. , the last date the\nholder of a security can sell the security and\nstill receive dividends payable on the\nsecurity sold). If neither the Authorized\nParticipant nor the Beneficial Owner on whose\nbehalf the Authorized Participant is acting\nhas appropriate arrangements to take delivery\nof Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in\nits discretion exercise its option to redeem\nsuch shares in cash, and the Beneficial Owner\nwill be required to receive its redemption\nproceeds in cash. In such case, the investor\nwill receive a cash payment equal to the net\nasset value of its shares based on the NAV of\nthe relevant Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charges specified above to offset\nthe Fund's brokerage and other transaction\ncosts associated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and each Fund (whether or not it\notherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves\nthe right to redeem Creation Units for cash to\nthe extent that the Fund cannot lawfully\ndeliver specific Fund Securities upon\nredemptions or cannot do so without first\nregistering the Fund Securities under such\nlaws. Although the Trust does not ordinarily\npermit cash redemptions of Creation Units, in\nthe event that cash redemptions are permitted\nor required by the Trust, proceeds will be\npaid to the Authorized Participant redeeming\nshares as soon as practicable after the date\nof redemption (within seven calendar days\nthereafter). If a Fund includes a foreign\ninvestment in its basket, and if a local\nmarket holiday, or series of consecutive\nholidays, or the extended delivery cycles for\ntransferring foreign investments to redeeming\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of the foreign investment in response\nto a redemption request, a Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if a Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant's\nagreement with the Distributor or its agent,\nin the event an Authorized Participant has\nsubmitted a redemption request in proper form\nbut is unable to transfer all or part of the\nCreation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or\nprior to the time specified by a Fund or its\ncustodian on the Business Day after the date\nof submission of such redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by a Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business Day after the date of submission\nof such redemption request and shall be held\nby State Street or Citibank, as applicable,\nand marked-to-market daily. The fees of State\nStreet or Citibank, as applicable, and any\nsub-custodians in respect of the delivery,\nmaintenance and redelivery of the collateral\nshall be payable by the Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement permits the Funds to acquire shares\nof the Funds at any time and subjects the\nAuthorized Participant to liability for any\nshortfall between the aggregate of the cost to\nthe Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the\nvalue of the Cash Amount, and the value of the\ncollateral together with liability for related\nbrokerage and other charges. Because the\nportfolio securities of a Fund may trade on\nexchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange\nis closed or are otherwise not Business Days\nfor such Fund, shareholders may not be able to\nredeem their shares of such Fund or purchase\nor sell shares of such Fund on the Listing\nExchange on days when the NAV of such a Fund\ncould be significantly affected by events in\nthe relevant non-U.S. markets. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of\npayment postponed with respect to any Fund:\n(i) for any period during which the applicable\nListing Exchange is closed (other than\ncustomary weekend and holiday closings); (ii)\nfor any period during which trading on the\napplicable Listing Exchange is suspended or\nrestricted; (iii) for any period during which\nan emergency exists as a result of which\ndisposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio\nsecurities or determination of its NAV is not\nreasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and each Fund may accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\na Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. Each Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of a Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for\n\n125\n\ncompliance with those parameters. In addition,\nwhen constructing custom baskets for\nredemptions, the tax efficiency of a Fund may\nbe taken into account. The policies and\nprocedures distinguish among different types\nof custom baskets that may be used for each\nFund and impose different requirements for\ndifferent types of custom baskets in order to\nseek to mitigate against potential risks of\nconflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Funds, as set forth in each\nFund's policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets. Taxes The following is a\nsummary of certain material U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations regarding the\npurchase, ownership and disposition of shares\nof a Fund. This summary does not address all\nof the potential U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences that may be applicable to a Fund\nor to all categories of investors, some of\nwhich may be subject to special tax rules.\nCurrent and prospective shareholders are urged\nto consult their own tax advisors with respect\nto the specific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Regulated Investment\nCompany Qualifications. Each Fund intends to\nqualify for treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of each\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of each\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of each Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of each\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. A Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, a Fund fails one of these tests\nand does not timely cure the failure, that\nFund will be taxed in the same manner as an\nordinary corporation and distributions to its\nshareholders will not be deductible by that\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. A\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities.\n\n126\n\nTaxation of RICs. As a RIC, a Fund will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on the\nportion of its taxable investment income and\ncapital gains that it distributes to its\nshareholders, provided that it satisfies a\nminimum distribution requirement. To satisfy\nthe minimum distribution requirement, a Fund\nmust distribute to its shareholders at least\nthe sum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than its\nnet realized long-term capital gain over its\nnet realized short-term capital loss), plus or\nminus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its\nnet tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A\nFund will be subject to income tax at regular\ncorporate rates on any taxable income or gains\nthat it does not distribute to its\nshareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for\nany taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the\ndistribution requirement, all of its taxable\nincome will be subject to tax at regular\ncorporate income tax rates without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand such distributions generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends\nto the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although\neach Fund intends to distribute substantially\nall of its net investment income and its\ncapital gains for each taxable year, a Fund\nmay decide to retain a portion of its income\nor gains if the Fund determines that doing so\nis in the interest of its shareholders. Each\nFund will be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to\nqualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out\nits earnings and profits accumulated in that\nyear in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a\nFund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two taxable years, the Fund may\nbe required to recognize any net built-in\ngains with respect to certain of its assets (\ni.e., the excess of the aggregate gains,\nincluding items of income, over aggregate\nlosses that would have been realized with\nrespect to such assets if the Fund had been\nliquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Excise Tax. A Fund will be\nsubject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by a Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. Each Fund intends to declare\nand distribute dividends and distributions in\nthe amounts and at the times necessary to\navoid the application of this 4% excise tax.\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards. Net capital\nloss carryforwards may be applied against any\nnet realized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that a Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. The following\nFunds had net capital loss carryforwards as\nset forth in the table below as of August 31,\n2023, the tax year-end for the Funds listed:\n                                              \n  Fund                   Non-ExpiringCapital  \n                            LossCarryforward  \n  iShares Emergent                            \n  Food and                          $220,484  \n  AgTechMultisector                           \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares ESG                                 \n  Advanced MSCI EAFE              15,791,410  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares ESG                                 \n  Advanced MSCI USA               29,981,927  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares ESG Aware              566,529,694  \n  MSCI EAFE ETF                               \n  iShares ESG Aware            1,637,135,284  \n  MSCI USA ETF                                \n  iShares ESG Aware                   26,873  \n  MSCI USA GrowthETF                          \n  iShares ESG Aware                           \n  MSCI USA                       112,577,877  \n  Small-CapETF                                \n  iShares ESG Aware                   80,737  \n  MSCI USA Value ETF                          \n  iShares ESG MSCI                77,270,870  \n  USA Leaders ETF                             \n  iShares MSCI                     2,424,703  \n  Denmark ETF                                 \n  iShares MSCI                     5,577,801  \n  Finland ETF                                 \n                                              \n127\n                                              \n  Fund                   Non-ExpiringCapital  \n                            LossCarryforward  \n  iShares MSCI                   221,558,856  \n  Indonesia ETF                               \n  iShares MSCI                    13,733,284  \n  Ireland ETF                                 \n  iShares MSCI Japan               5,290,378  \n  Value ETF                                   \n  iShares MSCI New                45,886,373  \n  Zealand ETF                                 \n  iShares MSCI Norway             11,977,242  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI                    81,870,539  \n  Philippines ETF                             \n  iShares MSCI Poland            156,752,171  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares MSCI United            599,102,446  \n  Kingdom ETF                                 \n  iShares MSCI United                         \n  Kingdom Small-Cap               15,128,508  \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares                                     \n  Paris-Aligned                   22,574,664  \n  Climate MSCI USAETF                         \n                                              \nTaxation of U.S. Shareholders. Dividends and\nother distributions by a Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by a Fund in\nOctober, November or December of any calendar\nyear and payable to shareholders of record on\na specified date in such a month shall be\ndeemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. Each\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if a Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\na Fund reports as capital gains dividends are\ntaxable as long-term capital gains, whether\npaid in cash or in shares and regardless of\nhow long a shareholder has held shares of the\nFund. All other dividends of a Fund (including\ndividends from short-term capital gains) from\nits current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits ( \u201c regular dividends \u201d ) are\ngenerally subject to tax as ordinary income,\nsubject to the discussion of qualified\ndividend income below. Long-term capital gains\nare eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of\n15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders,\ndepending on whether their income exceeds\ncertain threshold amounts. If an individual\nreceives a regular dividend qualifying for the\nlong-term capital gains rates and such\ndividend constitutes an \u201c extraordinary\ndividend, \u201d and the individual subsequently\nrecognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of\nstock in respect of which the extraordinary\ndividend was paid, then the loss will be long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of such\nextraordinary dividend. An \u201c extraordinary\ndividend \u201d on common stock for this purpose is\ngenerally a dividend (i) in an amount greater\nthan or equal to 10% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax\nbasis (or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount\ngreater than 20% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax basis\n(or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin a 365-day period. Distributions in\nexcess of a Fund\u2019s current and accumulated\nearnings and profits will, as to each\nshareholder, be treated as a tax-free return\nof capital to the extent of a shareholder\u2019s\nbasis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital\ngain thereafter (if the shareholder holds\nshares of the Fund as capital assets).\nDistributions in excess of a Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but not in excess\nof a Fund\u2019s earnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will not\nconstitute\n\n128\n\nnontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders\nreceiving dividends or distributions in the\nform of additional shares should be treated\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes as\nreceiving a distribution in an amount equal to\nthe amount of money that the shareholders\nreceiving cash dividends or distributions will\nreceive and should have a cost basis in the\nshares received equal to such amount. A 3.8%\nU.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is\nimposed on net investment income, including,\nbut not limited to, interest, dividends, and\nnet gain from investments, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if\nmarried and filing jointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Investors considering buying shares\njust prior to a dividend or capital gain\ndistribution should be aware that, although\nthe price of shares purchased at that time may\nreflect the amount of the forthcoming\ndistribution, such dividend or distribution\nmay nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund\nis the holder of record of any security on the\nrecord date for any dividends payable with\nrespect to such security, such dividends will\nbe included in the Fund\u2019s gross income not as\nof the date received but as of the later of\n(a) the date such security became ex-dividend\nwith respect to such dividends ( i.e. , the\ndate on which a buyer of the security would\nnot be entitled to receive the declared, but\nunpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund\nacquired such security. Accordingly, in order\nto satisfy its income distribution\nrequirements, a Fund may be required to pay\ndividends based on anticipated earnings, and\nshareholders may receive dividends in an\nearlier year than would otherwise be the case.\nIn certain situations, a Fund may, for a\ntaxable year, defer all or a portion of its\nnet capital loss (or if there is no net\ncapital loss, then any net long-term or short-\nterm capital loss) realized after October and\nits late-year ordinary loss (defined as the\nsum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign\ncurrency and passive foreign investment\ncompany ( \u201c PFIC \u201d ) losses over post-October\nforeign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the\nexcess of post-December ordinary losses over\npost-December ordinary income) until the next\ntaxable year in computing its investment\ncompany taxable income and net capital gain,\nwhich will defer the recognition of such\nrealized losses. Such deferrals and other\nrules regarding gains and losses realized\nafter October (or December) may affect the tax\ncharacter of shareholder distributions. Sales\nof Shares. Upon the sale or exchange of shares\nof a Fund, a shareholder will realize a\ntaxable gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized and the\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund. A\nredemption of shares by a Fund will be treated\nas a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss\nwill be treated as capital gain or loss if the\nshares are capital assets in the shareholder\u2019s\nhands and will be long-term capital gain or\nloss if the shares are held for more than one\nyear and short-term capital gain or loss if\nthe shares are held for one year or less. Any\nloss realized on a sale or exchange will be\ndisallowed to the extent the shares disposed\nof are replaced, including replacement through\nthe reinvesting of dividends or capital gains\ndistributions, or by an option or contract to\nacquire substantially identical shares, within\na 61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of a Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, a Fund will be required to withhold at\na 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such\namounts withheld from any distributions paid\nto a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability.\n\n129\n\nSections 351 and 362. The Trust, on behalf of\neach Fund, has the right to reject an order\nfor a purchase of shares of the Fund if the\npurchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon\nobtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or\nmore of the outstanding shares of a given Fund\nand if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would\nhave a basis in the securities different from\nthe market value of such securities on the\ndate of deposit. If a Fund\u2019s basis in such\nsecurities on the date of deposit was less\nthan market value on such date, the Fund, upon\ndisposition of the securities, would recognize\nmore taxable gain or less taxable loss than if\nits basis in the securities had been equal to\nmarket value. It is not anticipated that the\nTrust will exercise the right of rejection\nexcept in a case where the Trust determines\nthat accepting the order could result in\nmaterial adverse tax consequences to a Fund or\nits shareholders. The Trust also has the right\nto require information necessary to determine\nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. Taxation of Certain\nDerivatives. A Fund\u2019s transactions in zero\ncoupon securities, non-U.S. currencies,\nforward contracts, options and futures\ncontracts (including options and futures\ncontracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the\nextent permitted, will be subject to special\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code\n(including provisions relating to \u201c hedging\ntransactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d ) that, among\nother consequences, may affect the character\nof gains and losses realized by the Fund (\ni.e. , may affect whether gains or losses are\nordinary or capital), accelerate recognition\nof income to the Fund and defer Fund losses.\nThese rules could therefore affect the\ncharacter, amount and timing of distributions\nto shareholders. These provisions also (a)\nwill require a Fund to mark-to-market certain\ntypes of the positions in its portfolio ( i.e.\n, treat them as if they were closed out at the\nend of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to\nrecognize income without receiving cash with\nwhich to pay dividends or make distributions\nin amounts necessary to satisfy the\ndistribution requirements for avoiding income\nand excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its\ntransactions, will make the appropriate tax\nelections and will make the appropriate\nentries in its books and records when it\nacquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S.\ncurrency, forward contract, option, futures\ncontract or hedged investment in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and prevent\ndisqualification of a Fund as a RIC. A Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in so-called \u201c Section 1256\ncontracts, \u201d such as regulated futures\ncontracts, most non-U.S. currency forward\ncontracts traded in the interbank market and\noptions on most security indexes, are subject\nto special tax rules. All Section 1256\ncontracts held by a Fund at the end of its\ntaxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in a\nFund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by a Fund from positions in Section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by a Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, a Fund may make\nor receive periodic net payments. A Fund may\nalso make or receive a payment when a swap is\nterminated prior to maturity through an\nassignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if a Fund has been a party to the swap\nfor more than one year). With respect to\ncertain types of swaps, a Fund may be required\nto currently recognize income or loss with\nrespect to future payments on such swaps or\nmay elect under certain circumstances to mark\nsuch swaps to market annually for tax purposes\nas ordinary income or loss. Qualified Dividend\nIncome. Distributions by a Fund of investment\ncompany taxable income (including any short-\nterm capital gains), whether received in cash\nor shares, will be taxable either as ordinary\nincome or as qualified dividend income, which\nis eligible to be taxed at long-term capital\ngain rates to the extent a Fund receives\nqualified dividend income on the securities it\nholds and a Fund reports the distribution as\nqualified dividend income. Qualified dividend\nincome is, in general, dividend income from\ntaxable U.S. corporations (but generally not\nfrom U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S.\ncorporations ( e.g. , non-U.S. corporations\nthat are not PFICs and which are incorporated\nin a possession of the U.S. or in certain\ncountries with a comprehensive tax treaty with\nthe U.S., or the stock of which is readily\ntradable on an established securities market\nin the U.S. (where the dividends are paid with\nrespect to such stock)). Under current IRS\nguidance, the U.S. has appropriate\ncomprehensive income tax treaties with the\nfollowing countries: Australia, Austria,\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria,\nCanada, China (but not with Hong Kong, which\nis treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S.\ntax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech Republic,\nDenmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France,\nGermany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India,\nIndonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica,\nJapan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania,\nLuxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan,\nthe Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania,\nRussia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South\nAfrica, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago,\nTunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and\nVenezuela. Substitute payments received by a\nFund for securities lent out by a Fund will\nnot be qualified dividend income.\n\n130\n\nA dividend from a Fund will not be treated as\nqualified dividend income to the extent that:\n(i) the shareholder has not held the shares on\nwhich the dividend was paid for 61 days during\nthe 121-day period that begins on the date\nthat is 60 days before the date on which the\nshares become ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe securities it holds that paid the\ndividends distributed to the shareholder (or,\nin the case of certain preferred stocks, the\nholding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) a Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a\nFund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated\nas qualified dividend income only to the\nextent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by a Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by a Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by a Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify\nfor the U.S. federal dividends received\ndeduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum\nholding period during the 90-day period that\nbegins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or\n91-day minimum holding period during the 180\nperiod beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend\ndate for certain preference dividends) during\nwhich risk of loss may not be diminished is\nrequired for the applicable shares, at both\nthe Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend\nto be eligible for the dividends received\ndeduction. Restrictions may apply if\nindebtedness, including a short sale, is\nattributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Funds\nserve to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by\ntheir tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a\nFund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-\nfinanced property in the hands of the tax-\nexempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by a Fund\nfrom REITs, real estate mortgage investment\nconduits, taxable mortgage pools or other\ninvestments may cause the Fund to report some\nor all of its distributions as \u201c excess\ninclusion income. \u201d To Fund shareholders, such\nexcess inclusion income may: (i) constitute\ntaxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders\nwho would otherwise be tax-exempt such as\nindividual retirement accounts, 401(k)\naccounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and\ncertain charitable entities; (ii) not be\noffset by otherwise allowable deductions for\ntax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for\nreduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S.\nshareholders even from tax treaty countries;\nand (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax\nif certain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust. Each Fund tries to avoid\ninvesting in REITs that are expected to\ngenerate excess inclusion income, but a Fund\nmay not always be successful in doing so.\nBecause information about a REIT\u2019s investments\nmay be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a\nREIT may change its investment program, a Fund\nmay not be successful in avoiding the\nconsequences described above. Avoidance of\ninvestments in REITs that generate excess\ninclusion income may require a Fund to forego\notherwise attractive investment opportunities.\nNon-U.S. Investments. Under Section 988 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, gains or losses\nattributable to fluctuations in exchange rates\nbetween the time a Fund accrues income or\nreceivables or expenses or other liabilities\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency and the\ntime a Fund actually collects such income or\npays such liabilities are generally treated as\nordinary income or ordinary loss. In general,\ngains (and losses) realized on debt\ninstruments will be treated as Section 988\ngain (or loss) to the extent attributable to\nchanges in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and the currencies in which the\ninstruments are denominated. Similarly, gains\nor losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S.\ncurrency forward contracts and certain\nnon-U.S. currency options or futures contracts\ndenominated in non-U.S. currency, to the\nextent attributable to fluctuations in\nexchange rates between the acquisition and\ndisposition dates, are also treated as\nordinary income or loss unless a Fund was to\nelect otherwise.\n\n131\n\nCertain Funds may be subject to non-U.S.\nincome taxes withheld at the source. Each\nFund, if permitted to do so, may elect to \u201c\npass through \u201d to its investors the amount of\nnon-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund\nprovided that the Fund held the security on\nthe dividend settlement date and for at least\n15 additional days immediately before and/or\nthereafter, with the result that each investor\nwith respect to shares of the Fund held for a\nminimum 16-day holding period at the time of\ndeemed distribution will (i) include in gross\nincome, even though not actually received, the\ninvestor\u2019s pro rata share of the Fund\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct\n(in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only\nfor investors who itemize their deductions on\ntheir personal tax returns) or credit (in\ncalculating U.S. federal income tax) the\ninvestor\u2019s pro rata share of the Fund\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on\ndividends on non-U.S. securities while such\nsecurities are lent out by a Fund are not\neligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through.\nTaxes not \u201c passed through \u201d for tax purposes\nwill not be available to shareholders for\nforeign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person\ninvested in the Fund in a year that the Fund\nelects to \u201c pass through \u201d its non-U.S. taxes\nmay be treated as receiving additional\ndividend income subject to U.S. withholding\ntax. A non-U.S. tax credit may not exceed the\ninvestor\u2019s U.S. federal income tax otherwise\npayable with respect to the investor\u2019s\nnon-U.S. source income. For this purpose,\nshareholders must treat as non-U.S. source\ngross income (i) their proportionate shares of\nnon-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and (ii) the\nportion of any dividend paid by the Fund that\nrepresents income derived from non-U.S.\nsources; the Fund\u2019s gain from the sale of\nsecurities will generally be treated as\nU.S.-source income. Certain limitations will\nbe imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S.\ntax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares\nare loaned pursuant to securities lending\narrangements, you may lose the ability to use\nany non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a\nFund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while\nthe shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\nwith respect to shares of a Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. Passive Foreign Investment Companies.\nIf a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on a\nportion of any \u201c excess distribution \u201d or gain\nfrom the disposition of such shares even if\nsuch income is distributed as a taxable\ndividend by the Fund to its shareholders.\nAdditional charges in the nature of interest\nmay be imposed on the Fund in respect of\ndeferred taxes arising from such distributions\nor gains. If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC\nand elect to treat the PFIC as a \u201c qualified\nelecting fund \u201d under the Internal Revenue\nCode, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, a\nFund might be required to include in income\neach year a portion of the ordinary earnings\nand net capital gains of the qualified\nelecting fund, even if not distributed to a\nFund, and such amounts would be subject to the\n90% and excise tax distribution requirements\ndescribed above. In order to make this\nelection, a Fund would be required to obtain\ncertain annual information from the PFICs in\nwhich it invests, which may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain. Alternatively, a Fund\nmay make a mark-to-market election that would\nresult in a Fund being treated as if it had\nsold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end\nof each year. In such case, a Fund would\nreport any such gains as ordinary income and\nwould deduct any such losses as ordinary\nlosses to the extent of previously recognized\ngains. The election must be made separately\nfor each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made,\nwould be effective for all subsequent taxable\nyears, unless revoked with the consent of the\nIRS. By making the election, a Fund could\npotentially ameliorate the adverse tax\nconsequences with respect to its ownership of\nshares in a PFIC, but in any particular year\nmay be required to recognize income in excess\nof the distributions it receives from PFICs\nand its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC\nstock. A Fund may have to distribute this \u201c\nphantom \u201d income and gain to satisfy the 90%\ndistribution requirement and to avoid\nimposition of the 4% excise tax. A Fund will\nmake the appropriate tax elections, if\npossible, and take any additional steps that\nare necessary to mitigate the effects of these\nrules. Reporting. If a shareholder recognizes\na loss with respect to a Fund\u2019s shares of $2\nmillion or more for an individual shareholder\nor $10 million or more for a corporate\nshareholder, the shareholder must file with\nthe IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form\n8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio\nsecurities are in many cases exempted from\nthis reporting requirement, but under current\nguidance, shareholders of a RIC are not\nexempted. The fact that a loss is reportable\nunder these regulations does not affect the\nlegal determination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\n\n132\n\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally not subject to such\nwithholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced\nrate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN\nor IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its\nentitlement to benefits under a treaty. The\nwithholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor business within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Properly-reported\ndividends are generally exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax where they (i) are\npaid in respect of a Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net\ninterest income \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S.\nsource interest income, other than certain\ncontingent interest and interest from\nobligations of a corporation or partnership in\nwhich the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder\nor partner, reduced by expenses that are\nallocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in\nrespect of a Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term\ncapital gains \u201d (generally, the excess of the\nFund\u2019s net short-term capital gain over the\nFund\u2019s long-term capital loss for such taxable\nyear). However, depending on its\ncircumstances, a Fund may report all, some or\nnone of its potentially eligible dividends as\nsuch qualified net interest income or as\nqualified short-term capital gains and/or\ntreat such dividends, in whole or in part, as\nineligible for this exemption from\nwithholding. In order to qualify for this\nexemption from withholding, a non-U.S.\nshareholder will need to comply with\napplicable certification requirements relating\nto its non-U.S. status (including, in general,\nfurnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of\nshares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if a Fund\nreports the payment as qualified net interest\nincome or qualified short-term capital gain.\nNon-U.S. shareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts. Special\nrules may apply to a foreign shareholder\nreceiving a Fund distribution if at least 50%\nof the Fund's assets consist of interests in\nU.S. real property interests, including\ncertain REITs and U.S. real property holding\ncorporations (as defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund\ndistributions that are attributable to gains\nfrom the disposition of a U.S. real property\ninterest will be taxable as ordinary dividends\nand subject to withholding at a 30% or lower\ntreaty rate if the foreign shareholder held no\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time\nduring the one-year period ending on the date\nof the distribution. If the foreign\nshareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's\nshares, the distribution would be treated as\nincome effectively connected with a trade or\nbusiness within the U.S. and the foreign\nshareholder would be subject to withholding\ntax at a rate of 21% and would generally be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences would generally\napply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the\nsale of Fund shares unless the Fund is\ndomestically controlled (meaning that more\nthan 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is\nheld by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign\nshareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of sale. Finally, a\ndomestically controlled Fund may be required\nto recognize a portion of its gain on the in-\nkind distribution of certain U.S. real\nproperty interests. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund. The rules\nlaid out in the previous two paragraphs, other\nthan the withholding rules, will apply\nnotwithstanding a Fund\u2019s participation in a\nwash sale transaction or its payment of a\nsubstitute dividend. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in a Fund. Separately, a\n30% withholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to: (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to\n\n133\n\naccount holders who fail to provide the\nrequired information; and determine certain\nother information concerning their account\nholders, or (ii) in the event an\nintergovernmental agreement and implementing\nlegislation are adopted, provide local revenue\nauthorities with similar account holder\ninformation. Other foreign entities may need\nto report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. Shares of a Fund held by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder at death will be\nconsidered situated within the U.S. and\nsubject to the U.S. estate tax. The foregoing\ndiscussion is a summary of certain material\nU.S. federal income tax considerations only\nand is not intended as a substitute for\ncareful tax planning. Purchasers of shares\nshould consult their own tax advisors as to\nthe tax consequences of investing in such\nshares, including consequences under state,\nlocal and non-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date of this SAI. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.

All correspondence received as\nset forth above shall be reviewed by the\nSecretary of the Trust and reported to the\nBoard.\n\n134\n\nRegulation Under the Alternative Investment\nFund Managers Directive. The Alternative\nInvestment Fund Managers Directive ( \u201c AIFMD \u201d\n) imposes detailed and prescriptive\nobligations on fund managers established in\nthe EU ( \u201c EU Operative Provisions \u201d ). These\ndo not currently apply to managers established\noutside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU\nmanagers are only required to comply with\ncertain disclosure, reporting and transparency\nobligations of AIFMD ( \u201c AIFMD Disclosure\nProvisions \u201d ) if such managers market a fund\nto EU investors. Where the AIFMD Disclosure\nProvisions relate to EU Operative Provisions\nthat do not apply to BFA, no meaningful\ndisclosure can be made. These EU Operative\nProvisions include prescriptive rules on:\nmeasuring and capping leverage in line with\nknown European standards; the treatment of\ninvestors; the use of \u201c depositaries \u201d ; and\ncoverage for professional liability risks.\nAIFMD imposes certain conditions on the\nmarketing of funds, such as the Funds, to EU\ninvestors. AIFMD requires that an \u2018alternative\ninvestment fund manager\u2019 ( \u201c AIFM \u201d ) be\nidentified to meet such conditions where such\nmarketing is sought. For these purposes BFA,\nas the legal entity responsible for performing\nthe portfolio and risk management of the\nFunds, shall be the AIFM. AIFMD requires\ndisclosure on an ongoing basis of certain\ninformation relating to the use of special\narrangements, leverage, rights of reuse of\ncollateral, guarantees granted under leverage\narrangements and the use of gates, side\npockets and similar liquidity management\ntools. Given that the Funds do not use any\nspecial arrangements or allow for collateral\nreuse, it is not intended that such\ndisclosures will need to be made by the Funds.\nEach Fund will, however, to the extent\nrelevant and appropriate, disclose in its\nannual report information on the Fund's\nleverage, risk profile and risk management\nsystems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also\ndisclose material changes, if any, to the\nliquidity management systems and procedures\nemployed in respect of the Fund. BFA has\nregistered the following Funds for marketing\nto investors in Finland, Sweden, and the U.K.:\niShares MSCI Philippines ETF\niShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF Investors\u2019\nRights. Each Fund relies on the services of\nBFA and its other service providers, including\nthe Distributor, administrator, custodian and\ntransfer agent. Further information about the\nduties and roles of these service providers is\nset out in this SAI. Investors who acquire\nshares of a Fund are not parties to the\nrelevant agreement with these service\nproviders and do not have express contractual\nrights against the Fund or its service\nproviders, except certain institutional\ninvestors that are Authorized Participants may\nhave certain express contractual rights with\nrespect to the Distributor under the terms of\nthe relevant Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors may have certain legal rights under\nfederal or state law against a Fund or its\nservice providers. In the event that an\ninvestor considers that it may have a claim\nagainst a Fund, or against any service\nprovider in connection with its investment in\na Fund, such investor should consult its own\nlegal advisor. By contract, Authorized\nParticipants irrevocably submit to the non-\nexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State\nor U.S. federal court sitting in New York City\nover any suit, action or proceeding arising\nout of or relating to the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Jurisdiction over other\nclaims, whether by investors or Authorized\nParticipants, will turn on the facts of the\nparticular case and the law of the\njurisdiction in which the proceeding is\nbrought.\n\n135\n\nAppendix A - iShares ETFs Proxy Voting\nPolicies Open-End Fund Proxy Voting Policy\nProcedures Governing Delegation of Proxy\nVoting to Fund Advisers Effective Date: August\n1, 2021 Last Review Date: August 25, 2023\nOpen-End Mutual Funds (including money market\nfunds) Exchange-Traded Funds Objective and\nScope Set forth below is the Open-End Fund\nProxy Voting Policy. Policy/Document\nRequirements and Statements The Boards of\nTrustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d ) of open-\nend funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d ) advised by\nBlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors,\nLLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ), have the responsibility\nfor the oversight of voting proxies relating\nto portfolio securities of the Funds, and have\ndetermined that it is in the best interests of\nthe Funds and their shareholders to delegate\nthe responsibility to vote proxies to\nBlackRock, subject to the principles outlined\nin this Policy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s\nauthority to manage, acquire and dispose of\naccount assets, all as contemplated by the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment management\nagreements. BlackRock has adopted guidelines\nand procedures (together and as from time to\ntime amended, the \u201c BlackRock proxy voting\nguidelines \u201d ) governing proxy voting by\naccounts managed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\ncast votes on behalf of each of the Funds on\nspecific proxy issues in respect of securities\nheld by each such Fund (or may refrain from\nvoting) in accordance with the BlackRock proxy\nvoting guidelines. BlackRock will report on an\nannual basis to the Directors on (1) a summary\nof the proxy voting process as applicable to\nthe Funds in the preceding year together with\na representation that all votes were in\naccordance with the BlackRock proxy voting\nguidelines, and (2) any changes to the\nBlackRock proxy voting guidelines that have\nnot previously been reported.\n\nA-1\n\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship Global\nPrinciples Effective as of January 2024\nBlackRock\n\nA-2\n                                              \n  Contents                                    \n  Introduction to BlackRock             A-4   \n  Philosophy on investment stewardship  A-4   \n  Shareholder rights                    A-4   \n  Key themes                            A-4   \n  Boards and directors                  A-5   \n  Auditors and audit-related issues     A-7   \n  Capital structure, mergers, asset           \n  sales, and other                      A-8   \n  special transactions                        \n  Executive compensation                A-8   \n  Material sustainability-related             \n  risks and                             A-9   \n  opportunities                               \n  Other corporate governance matters          \n  and shareholder                       A-11  \n  protections                                 \n  Shareholder proposals                 A-11  \n  BlackRock\u2019s oversight of its                \n  investment                            A-12  \n  stewardship activities                      \n  Vote execution                        A-12  \n  Voting Choice                         A-13  \n  Conflicts management policies and     A-13  \n  procedures                                  \n  Securities lending                    A-14  \n  Voting guidelines                     A-14  \n  Reporting and vote transparency       A-15  \n                                              \nThe purpose of this document is to provide an\noverarching explanation of BlackRock\u2019s\napproach globally to our responsibilities as a\nshareholder on behalf of our clients, our\nexpectations of companies, and our commitments\nto clients in terms of our own governance and\ntransparency.\n\nA-3\n\nIntroduction to BlackRock BlackRock\u2019s purpose\nis to help more and more people experience\nfinancial well-being. We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals. We also publish a quarterly list of\nall companies with which we engaged and the\nkey topics addressed in the engagement\nmeeting. In this way, we help inform our\nclients about the work we do on their behalf\nin promoting the governance and business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\n11 The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.\n\nA-15\n\nIS-SAI-08T-0924\n"
