Fees\nand Expenses The following table describes the\nfees and expenses that you will incur if you\nbuy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The\ninvestment advisory agreement between iShares\nTrust (the \u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund\nAdvisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment\nAdvisory Agreement \u201d ) provides that BFA will\npay all operating expenses of the Fund,\nexcept: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest\nexpenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions, including\nbrokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees\nor expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur\n\u201c Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. \u201d Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's pro\nrata share of the fees and expenses incurred\nindirectly by the Fund as a result of\ninvesting in other investment companies. The\nimpact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is\nincluded in the total returns of the Fund.\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not\nincluded in the calculation of the ratio of\nexpenses to average net assets shown in the\nFinancial Highlights section of the Fund's\nprospectus (the \u201c Prospectus \u201d ).BFA, the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fee so that the Fund\u2019s total annual\nfund operating expenses after the fee waiver\nwill not exceed 0.60% through November 30,\n2026. The contractual waiver may be terminated\nprior to November 30, 2026only upon written\nagreement of the Trust and BFA. You may pay\nother fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which\nare not reflected in the tables and examples\nbelow.\n                                              \n       Ann\u2026                                   \n       Fund                                   \n       Ope\u2026                                   \n       Exp\u2026                                   \n       exp\u2026                                   \n       that                                   \n       you                                    \n       pay                                    \n       each                                   \n       year                                   \n       as                                     \n       ape\u2026                                   \n       of                                     \n       the                                    \n       val\u2026                                   \n       of                                     \n       your                                   \n       inv\u2026                                   \n       Dis\u2026         Acq\u2026  Total  Fee   Total  \n  Ma\u2026  (12\u2026  Othe\u2026  Fun\u2026  Annu\u2026  Wai\u2026  Annu\u2026  \n                    Exp\u2026               Waiv\u2026  \n  0.\u2026  None  0.00%  0.2\u2026  0.49%  (0.\u2026  0.49%  \n                                              \n1 Operating expenses paid by BFA under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement exclude Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses, if any. 2 The expense\ninformation in the table has been restated to\nreflect current fees. 3 The amount rounded to\n0.00%. Example. This Example is intended to\nhelp you compare the cost of owning shares of\nthe Fund with the cost of investing in other\nfunds. The Example assumes that you invest\n$10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated and then sell all of your shares at\nthe end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return\neach year and that the Fund\u2019s operating\nexpenses remain the same. Although your actual\ncosts may be higher or lower, based on these\nassumptions, your costs would be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $50        $157     $274      $616  \n                                      \nS-1\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund and the\nunderlying funds in which the Fund invests\n(each, an \u201c Underlying Fund \u201d and\ncollectively, the \u201c Underlying Funds \u201d ), may\npay transaction costs, such as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells securities (or \u201c turns\nover \u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio\nturnover rate for the Fund or Underlying Funds\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\ncause the Fund or the Underlying Funds to\nincur increased expenses. These costs, which\nare not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example (except costs to\nUnderlying Funds included as part of Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. To the extent an Underlying Fund\nincurs costs from high portfolio turnover,\nsuch costs may have a negative effect on the\nperformance of the Fund. During the most\nrecent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 70% of the average value of\nits portfolio. Principal Investment Strategies\nThe Fund is a fund-of-funds and seeks to\nachieve its investment objective by investing\nprimarily in the securities of the Underlying\nFunds that themselves seek investment results\ncorresponding to their own underlying indexes.\nThe Fund invests in a combination of\nUnderlying Funds and may also invest in other\nexchange-traded funds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) (including\nother iShares funds), U.S. government\nsecurities, short-term paper, futures\ncontracts, options on futures contracts,\noptions, cash and cash equivalents, including\nshares of money market funds advised by BFA or\nits affiliates ( \u201c BlackRock Cash Funds \u201d ).\nThe Morningstar \u00ae Multi-Asset High Income\nIndex S M (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ) is\nbroadly diversified and seeks to deliver high\ncurrent income while maintaining long-term\ncapital appreciation. The goal of the\nUnderlying Index is to represent an allocation\nstrategy to distinct asset classes of 20%\nequities, 60% fixed-income and 20% in an \u201c\nalternative income sources \u201d asset class,\nwhich consists of Underlying Funds that the\nindex provider, Morningstar, Inc. ( \u201c\nMorningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ),\nconsiders to exhibit both equity and fixed-\nincome-like characteristics. Each asset class\nhas its own risk profile. The Underlying Index\nis rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly. The\nUnderlying Index is comprised of Underlying\nFunds within these asset classes that have\ndemonstrated relatively high income on a\nconsistent basis and meet liquidity\ncharacteristics as determined by Morningstar's\nproprietary index methodology. The 20% equity\nallocation consists of Underlying Funds that\ninvest primarily in U.S. and non-U.S.\nequities. The 60% fixed-income allocation\nconsists of Underlying Funds that invest\nprimarily in U.S. and non-U.S. fixed-income\nsecurities. The 20% alternative income source\nallocation generally consists of Underlying\nFunds that invest primarily in real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ) and preferred\nstocks. When the combined allocation\npercentages equal less than 100%, the Fund may\ninvest the remainder of its assets in\nBlackRock Cash Funds. Investments in\nUnderlying Funds that have significant\nnon-U.S. currency exposure will not exceed 25%\nof the weight of the Underlying Index. As of\nSeptember 23, 2024, the Underlying Index\nincluded the following Underlying Funds within\nthe equity asset class: iShares Latin America\n40 ETF and iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF; the\nfollowing Underlying Funds within the fixed-\nincome asset class: iShares Agency Bond ETF,\niShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond\nETF, iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF,\niShares Floating Rate Bond ETF, iShares J.P.\nMorgan EM Corporate Bond ETF and iShares J.P.\nMorgan EM Local Currency Bond ETF; and the\nfollowing Underlying Funds within the\nalternatives asset class: iShares Core U.S.\nREIT ETF, iShares Global REIT ETF and iShares\nPreferred and Income Securities ETF. The\nUnderlying Index may add, eliminate or replace\nUnderlying Funds at any time. As of September\n23, 2024, a significant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the financials industry or\nsector. The components of the Underlying Index\nare likely to change over time. BFA uses an\nindexing approach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. Unlike many investment\ncompanies, the Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and liquidity measures\nsimilar to those of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund and an Underlying Fund may or\nmay not hold all of the securities in the\napplicable Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in investments that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the component\nsecurities of its Underlying Index and may\ninvest up to 20% of its assets in certain\nfutures, options and swap contracts, cash and\ncash equivalents, including shares of money\nmarket funds advised by BFA or its affiliates,\nas well as in securities not included in the\nUnderlying Index, but which BFA believes will\nhelp the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash\nand cash equivalent investments associated\nwith a derivative position will be treated as\npart of that position for the purposes of\ncalculating the percentage of investments\nincluded in the Underlying Index. The Fund\nseeks to track the investment results of the\nUnderlying Index before fees and expenses of\nthe Fund. The Fund may lend securities\nrepresenting up to one-third of the value of\nthe Fund's total assets (including the value\nof any collateral received). The Underlying\nIndex is sponsored by Morningstar, which is\nindependent of the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and publishes information\nregarding the market value of the Underlying\nIndex. Industry Concentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments ( i.e. , hold\n25% or more of its total assets) in a\nparticular industry or group of industries to\napproximately the S-2 same extent that the\nUnderlying Index is concentrated. For purposes\nof this limitation, securities of the U.S.\ngovernment (including its agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. Summary of Principal Risks As\nwith any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Fund, and the\nFund's performance could trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject to certain\nrisks, including the principal risks noted\nbelow (either directly or through its\ninvestments in the Underlying Funds), any of\nwhich may adversely affect the Fund's net\nasset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), trading\nprice, yield, total return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. Certain key risks\nare prioritized below (with others following\nin alphabetical order), but the relative\nsignificance of any risk is difficult to\npredict and may change over time. You should\nreview each risk factor carefully. Income\nRisk. The Fund's income may decline if\ninterest rates fall. This decline in income\ncan occur because the Fund or an Underlying\nFund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding\nbonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are\nnear maturity or are called, bonds in the\nUnderlying Index are substituted, or the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund otherwise needs to\npurchase additional bonds. Credit Risk . Debt\nissuers and other counterparties may be unable\nor unwilling to make timely interest and/or\nprincipal payments when due or otherwise honor\ntheir obligations. Changes in an issuer\u2019s\ncredit rating or the market\u2019s perception of an\nissuer\u2019s creditworthiness may also adversely\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's investment in that issuer.\nThe degree of credit risk depends on an\nissuer's or counterparty's financial condition\nand on the terms of an obligation. Investment\nin Underlying Funds Risk. The Fund expects to\ninvest substantially all of its assets in the\nUnderlying Funds, so the Fund\u2019s investment\nperformance is directly related to the\nperformance of the Underlying Funds. The\nFund\u2019s NAV will change with changes in the\nvalue of the Underlying Funds and other\nsecurities in which the Fund invests based on\ntheir market valuations. An investment in the\nFund will entail more costs and expenses than\na direct investment in the Underlying Funds.\nAs the Underlying Funds, or the Fund\u2019s\nallocations among the Underlying Funds, change\nfrom time to time, or to the extent that the\ntotal annual fund operating expenses of any\nUnderlying Fund change, the weighted average\noperating expenses borne by the Fund may\nincrease or decrease. Affiliated Fund Risk. In\nmanaging the Fund, BFA has the ability to\nselect Underlying Funds and substitute other\nETFs which it believes will achieve the Fund\u2019s\nobjective. BFA may be subject to potential\nconflicts of interest in selecting Underlying\nFunds and substituting other ETFs because the\nfees paid to BFA by some Underlying Funds and\nother ETFs managed by BFA may be higher than\nthe fees paid by other Underlying Funds. If an\nUnderlying Fund or other ETF holds interests\nin an affiliated fund in excess of a certain\namount, the Fund may be prohibited from\npurchasing shares of that Underlying Fund or\nother ETF. Market Risk . The Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism, public\nhealth issues, recessions, the prospect or\noccurrence of a sovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund, the Underlying\nFunds and their investments and could result\nin increased premiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's NAV. Index-Related\nRisk. There is no guarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a high degree of\ncorrelation to those of the Underlying Index\nor that the Fund will achieve its investment\nobjective. Market disruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund\u2019s ability to adjust its exposure to\nthe required levels in order to track the\nUnderlying Index. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and\nmay not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the Fund\nand its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider, and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance. This could cause the Underlying\nIndex to vary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Allocation Risk. The Fund\u2019s\nability to achieve its investment objective\ndepends upon the Index Provider's ability to\ndevelop a model that accurately assesses the\nFund\u2019s asset class allocation and selects the\nbest mix of Underlying Funds and other ETFs.\nThere is a risk that the Index Provider's\nevaluations and assumptions regarding asset\nclasses or Underlying Funds, which are\nutilized as inputs in the model, may be\nincorrect in view of actual market conditions.\nAsset Class Risk. Securities and other assets\nin the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to the general financial\nmarkets, a particular financial market or\nother asset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined in the Creations and\nRedemptions section of this prospectus (the \u201c\nProspectus \u201d )) may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund, and none of those Authorized\nParticipants is obligated to engage in\ncreation and/or redemption transactions. The\nFund has a limited number of institutions that\nmay act as Authorized Participants on an\nagency basis ( i.e., on behalf of other market\nparticipants). To the extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or are unable\nto proceed with creation or redemption orders\nwith respect to the Fund and no other\nAuthorized Participant is able to step forward\nto create or redeem, Fund shares may be more\nlikely to trade at a premium or discount to\nNAV and possibly face trading halts or\ndelisting. Authorized Participant\nconcentration risk may be heightened for ETFs,\nsuch as the Fund, that invest in securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities\nor instruments that have lower trading\nvolumes. Calculation Methodology Risk. The\nIndex Provider relies on various sources of\ninformation to assess the criteria of S-3\ncomponents of the Underlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on assumptions\nand estimates. Neither the Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index Provider\u2019s\ncalculation methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Call Risk .\nDuring periods of falling interest rates, an\nissuer of a callable bond held by the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund may \u201c call \u201d or repay the\nsecurity before its stated maturity, and the\nFund or an Underlying Fund may have to\nreinvest the proceeds in securities with lower\nyields, which would result in a decline in the\nFund's income, or in securities with greater\nrisks or with other less favorable features.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund's or an Underlying Fund's investments are\nconcentrated in the securities and/or other\nassets of a particular issuer or issuers,\ncountry, group of countries, region, market,\nindustry, group of industries, sector, market\nsegment or asset class. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund's and the Underlying Funds'\nNAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the\nFund's NAV could decline if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund invests depreciates against\nthe U.S. dollar or if there are delays or\nlimits on repatriation of such currency.\nCurrency exchange rates can be very volatile\nand can change quickly and unpredictably. As a\nresult, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and\nwithout warning. Cybersecurity Risk . Failures\nor breaches of the electronic systems of the\nFund or the Underlying Funds, the Funds' or\nthe Underlying Funds' adviser, distributor,\nthe Index Provider and other service\nproviders, market makers, Authorized\nParticipants or the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests have the ability to\ncause disruptions, negatively impact the\nFund\u2019s business operations and/or potentially\nresult in financial losses to the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has established\nbusiness continuity plans and risk management\nsystems seeking to address system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent limitations in\nsuch plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity plans and\nsystems of the Fund\u2019s Index Provider and other\nservice providers, market makers, Authorized\nParticipants or issuers of securities in which\nthe Fund invests. Dividend-Paying Stock Risk .\nInvesting in dividend-paying stocks involves\nthe risk that such stocks may fall out of\nfavor with investors and underperform the\nbroader market. Companies that issue dividend-\npaying stocks are not required to pay or\ncontinue paying dividends on such stocks. It\nis possible that issuers of the stocks held by\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund will not\ndeclare dividends in the future or will reduce\nor eliminate the payment of dividends\n(including reducing or eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the payment of\ndividends) in the future. Equity Securities\nRisk . Equity securities are subject to\nchanges in value, and their values may be more\nvolatile than those of other asset classes.\nThe Underlying Index is composed of common\nstocks, which generally subject their holders\nto more risks than preferred stocks and debt\nsecurities because common stockholders\u2019 claims\nare subordinated to those of holders of\npreferred stocks and debt securities upon the\nbankruptcy of the issuer. Financials Sector\nRisk . The performance of companies in the\nfinancials sector may be adversely impacted by\nmany factors, including, among others, changes\nin government regulations, economic\nconditions, and interest rates, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public perception,\nexposure concentration and decreased liquidity\nin credit markets. The impact of changes in\nregulation of any individual financial\ncompany, or of the financials sector as a\nwhole, cannot be predicted. Cybersecurity\nincidents and technology malfunctions and\nfailures have become increasingly frequent and\nhave caused significant losses to companies in\nthis sector, which may negatively impact an\nUnderlying Fund. Geographic Risk . A natural\ndisaster could occur in a geographic region in\nwhich the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests,\nwhich could adversely affect the economy or\nthe business operations of companies in the\nspecific geographic region, causing an adverse\nimpact on the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestments in, or which are exposed to, the\naffected region. High Yield Securities Risk.\nSecurities that are rated below investment-\ngrade (commonly referred to as \u201c junk bonds, \u201d\nwhich may include those bonds rated below \u201c\nBBB- \u201d by S&P Global Ratings, a subsidiary of\nS&P Global, Inc. ( \u201c S&P Global Ratings \u201d )\nand Fitch Ratings, Inc. ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ) or below\n\u201c Baa3 \u201d by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (\n\u201c Moody's \u201d )), or are unrated, may be deemed\nspeculative, may involve greater levels of\nrisk than higher-rated securities of similar\nmaturity and may be more likely to default.\nIndexing Investment Risk . The Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds are not actively managed, and\nBFA generally does not attempt to take\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets.\nInfectious Illness Risk. A widespread outbreak\nof an infectious illness, such as the COVID-19\npandemic, may result in travel restrictions,\ndisruption of healthcare services, prolonged\nquarantines, cancellations, supply chain\ndisruptions, business closures, lower consumer\ndemand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults\nand other significant economic, social and\npolitical impacts. Markets may experience\ntemporary closures, extreme volatility, severe\nlosses, reduced liquidity and increased\ntrading costs. Such events may adversely\naffect the Fund and its investments and may\nimpact the Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or sell\nsecurities or cause elevated tracking error\nand increased premiums or discounts to the\nFund's NAV. Despite the development of\nvaccines, the duration of the COVID-19\npandemic and its effects cannot be predicted\nwith certainty. Interest Rate Risk . During\nperiods of very low or negative interest\nrates, the Fund may be unable to maintain\npositive returns or pay dividends to Fund\nshareholders. Very low or negative interest\nrates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing\ninterest rates, including rates that fall\nbelow zero, may have unpredictable effects on\nmarkets, result in heightened market\nvolatility and detract from the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to the extent the Fund is exposed\nto such interest rates. Additionally, under\ncertain market S-4 conditions in which\ninterest rates are low and the market prices\nfor portfolio securities have increased, the\nFund may have a very low or even negative\nyield. A low or negative yield would cause the\nFund to lose money in certain conditions and\nover certain time periods. An increase in\ninterest rates will generally cause the value\nof securities held by the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund to decline, may lead to\nheightened volatility in the fixed-income\nmarkets and may adversely affect the liquidity\nof certain fixed-income investments, including\nthose held by the Fund or an Underlying Fund.\nBecause rates on certain floating rate debt\nsecurities typically reset only periodically,\nchanges in prevailing interest rates (and\nparticularly sudden and significant changes)\ncan be expected to cause some fluctuations in\nthe net asset value of the Underlying Fund to\nthe extent that it invests in floating rate\ndebt securities. The historically low interest\nrate environment in recent years heightens the\nrisks associated with rising interest rates.\nIssuer Risk . The performance of the Fund\ndepends on the performance of individual\nsecurities to which the Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds have exposure. Changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit rating of an\nissuer of those securities may cause the value\nof the securities to decline. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller capitalization\ncompanies. During different market cycles, the\nperformance of large-capitalization companies\nhas trailed the overall performance of the\nbroader securities markets. Management Risk .\nAs the Fund will not fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject to the risk\nthat BFA's investment strategy may not produce\nthe intended results. Market Trading Risk .\nThe Fund and the Underlying Funds face\nnumerous market trading risks, including the\npotential lack of an active market for their\nshares, losses from trading in secondary\nmarkets, periods of high volatility and\ndisruptions in the creation/redemption\nprocess. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS,\nMAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING\nFUNDS' SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT\nTO NAV . Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk .\nCompared to large-capitalization companies,\nmid-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. In addition, the securities of\nmid-capitalization companies may be more\nvolatile and less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies. Model Risk . Neither\nthe Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the\nUnderlying Index's allocation model will\nachieve its intended results or maximize\nreturns or minimize risk, or be appropriate\nfor every investor seeking a particular risk\nprofile. Non-U.S. Issuers Risk. Securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers carry different\nrisks from securities issued by U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards,\nthe possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation, adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations,\npolitical instability, regulatory and economic\ndifferences, and potential restrictions on the\nflow of international capital. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Investments in the\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to\nthe risks associated with investing in those\nnon-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of\ninflation or nationalization. The Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds may lose money due to\npolitical, economic and geographic events\naffecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or\nnon-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S.\nsecurities markets may trade a small number of\nsecurities and may be unable to respond\neffectively to changes in trading volume,\npotentially making prompt liquidation of\nholdings difficult or impossible at times.\nOperational Risk . The Fund and the Underlying\nFunds are exposed to operational risks arising\nfrom a number of factors, including, but not\nlimited to, human error, processing and\ncommunication errors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund,\nthe Underlying Funds and BFA seek to reduce\nthese operational risks through controls and\nprocedures. However, these measures do not\naddress every possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant operational\nrisks. Privately Issued Securities Risk. The\nFund or the Underlying Funds may invest in\nprivately issued securities, including those\nthat are normally purchased pursuant to Rule\n144A or Regulation S promulgated under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201c 1933\nAct \u201d ). Privately issued securities are\nsecurities that have not been registered under\nthe 1933 Act and as a result may be subject to\nlegal restrictions on resale. Privately issued\nsecurities are generally not traded on\nestablished markets. As a result of the\nabsence of a public trading market, privately\nissued securities may be deemed to be illiquid\ninvestments, may be more difficult to value\nthan publicly traded securities and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in value. Delay\nor difficulty in selling such securities may\nresult in a loss to the Fund. Reinvestment\nRisk . The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\ninvest a portion of its assets in short-term\nfixed-income instruments and, as a result, may\nbe adversely affected if interest rates fall\nbecause they may have to invest in lower-\nyielding bonds as bonds mature. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk . The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund invests in countries or\nregions whose economies are heavily dependent\nupon trading with key partners. Any reduction\nin this trading may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's investments. Risk of Investing in\nChina . Investments in Chinese issuers subject\nthe Fund or the Underlying Funds to risks\nspecific to China. China may be subject to\nconsiderable degrees of economic, political\nand social instability. China is an emerging\nmarket and demonstrates significantly higher\nvolatility from time to time in comparison to\ndeveloped markets. Over the last few decades,\nthe Chinese government has undertaken reform\nof economic and market practices and has\nexpanded the sphere of private ownership of\nproperty in China. However, Chinese markets\ngenerally continue to experience inefficiency,\nvolatility and pricing S-5 anomalies resulting\nfrom governmental influence, a lack of\npublicly available information and/or\npolitical and social instability. Chinese\ncompanies are also subject to the risk that\nChinese authorities can intervene in their\noperations and structure. Internal social\nunrest or confrontations with neighboring\ncountries, including military conflicts in\nresponse to such events, may also disrupt\neconomic development in China and result in a\ngreater risk of currency fluctuations,\ncurrency non-convertibility, interest rate\nfluctuations and higher rates of inflation.\nChina has experienced security concerns, such\nas terrorism and strained international\nrelations. Additionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-sponsored\ncyberattacks against foreign companies and\nforeign governments. Actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity and strained\ninternational relations, including purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. Incidents involving China's or\nthe region's security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and the Fund's investments.\nExport growth continues to be a major driver\nof China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in\nspending on Chinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification, institution of\nadditional tariffs or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions or a trade war between China and the\nU.S. or in response to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any\nof the economies of China's key trading\npartners may have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy. The Underlying Index may\ninclude companies that are subject to economic\nor trade restrictions (but not investment\nrestrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national security, human\nrights or other concerns of such government.\nSo long as these restrictions do not include\nrestrictions on investments, the Fund is\ngenerally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the Underlying Index.\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Fund invests\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they do not meet\nU.S. accounting standards and auditor\noversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund is not\nactively managed and does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. Risk of Investing in Russia.\nInvesting in Russian securities involves\nsignificant risks, including legal,\nregulatory, currency and economic risks that\nare specific to Russia. In addition, investing\nin Russian securities involves risks\nassociated with the settlement of portfolio\ntransactions and loss of the Fund\u2019s ownership\nrights in its portfolio securities as a result\nof the system of share registration and\ncustody in Russia. Governments in the U.S. and\nmany other countries have imposed economic\nsanctions on certain Russian individuals and\nRussian corporate and banking entities. A\nnumber of jurisdictions may also institute\nbroader sanctions on Russia. Russia has issued\na number of countersanctions, some of which\nrestrict the distribution of profits by\nlimited liability companies ( e.g. ,\ndividends), and prohibit Russian persons from\nentering into transactions with designated\npersons from \u201c unfriendly states \u201d as well as\nthe export of raw materials or other products\nfrom Russia to certain sanctioned persons.\nRussia launched a large-scale invasion of\nUkraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and\nduration of the military action, resulting\nsanctions and resulting future market\ndisruptions, including declines in its stock\nmarkets and the value of the ruble against the\nU.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but\ncould be significant. Disruptions caused by\nRussian military action or other actions\n(including cyberattacks and espionage) or\nresulting actual and threatened responses to\nsuch activity, including purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts or changes in\nconsumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies, or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia\u2019s\neconomy and Russian companies in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors globally. Russian companies may\nbe unable to pay dividends and, if they pay\ndividends, the Fund may be unable to receive\nthem. As a result of sanctions, the Fund is\ncurrently restricted from trading in Russian\nsecurities, including those in its portfolio,\nwhile the Underlying Index has removed Russian\nsecurities. It is unknown when, or if,\nsanctions may be lifted or the Fund\u2019s ability\nto trade in Russian securities will resume.\nRisk of Investing in Saudi Arabia . The\nability of foreign investors (such as the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund) to invest in the\nsecurities of Saudi Arabian issuers is\nrelatively new. Such ability could be\nrestricted by the Saudi Arabian government at\nany time, and unforeseen risks could\nmaterialize with respect to foreign ownership\nin such securities. The economy of Saudi\nArabia is dominated by petroleum exports. A\nsustained decrease in petroleum prices could\nhave a negative impact on all aspects of the\neconomy. Investments in the securities of\nSaudi Arabian issuers involve risks not\ntypically associated with investments in\nsecurities of issuers in more developed\ncountries that may negatively affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's\ninvestments. Such heightened risks may\ninclude, among others, expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets, restrictions on and\ngovernment intervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision\nmaking, armed conflict, crime and instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. There remains the\npossibility that instability in the larger\nMiddle East region could adversely impact the\neconomy of Saudi Arabia, and there is no\nassurance of political stability in Saudi\nArabia. Saudi Arabia Broker Risk. There are a\nnumber of different ways of conducting\ntransactions in equity securities in the Saudi\nArabian market. The Fund generally expects to\nconduct its transactions in a manner in which\nthe Fund would not be limited by Saudi Arabian\nregulations to a single broker. However, there\nmay be a limited number of brokers who can\nprovide services to the Fund, which may have\nan adverse impact on the prices, quantity or\ntiming of Fund transactions. S-6 Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Certain changes in the\nU.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy\nweakens or when its financial markets decline,\nmay have an adverse effect on the securities\nto which the Fund or the Underlying Funds have\nexposure. Savings Associations Risk. Savings\nassociations are affected by extensive\nregulations, interest rates, loan losses,\ndecreased availability of money or asset\nvaluation and market conditions. The\nhistorically low interest rate environment has\ncreated certain risks to savings associations\nas they continue to re-evaluate their business\nmodels and risk appetites to generate returns.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may engage in securities\nlending. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund or the Underlying Funds may lose\nmoney because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. The Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds could also lose money in the\nevent of a decline in the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or a decline in\nthe value of any investments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could also trigger\nadverse tax consequences for the Fund. Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk . Compared to\nmid- and large-capitalization companies,\nsmall-capitalization companies may be less\nstable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. In addition, the securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies may be more\nvolatile and less liquid than those of mid-\nand large-capitalization companies. Sovereign\nand Quasi-Sovereign Obligations Risk. An\nUnderlying Fund may invest in securities\nissued by or guaranteed by non-U.S. sovereign\ngovernments, which may be unable or unwilling\nto repay principal or interest when due. In\ntimes of economic uncertainty, the prices of\nthese securities may be more volatile than\nthose of corporate debt obligations or of\nother government debt obligations. Tax Risk .\nBecause the Fund is expected to invest in the\nUnderlying Funds, the Fund\u2019s realized losses\non sales of shares of an Underlying Fund may\nbe indefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c\nwash sales. \u201d Distributions of short-term\ncapital gains by an Underlying Fund will be\nrecognized as ordinary income by the Fund and\nwould not be offset by the Fund\u2019s capital loss\ncarryforwards, if any. Capital loss\ncarryforwards of an Underlying Fund, if any,\nwould not offset net capital gains of the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk . The Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur because of\ndifferences between the securities and other\ninstruments held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in the Underlying Index,\npricing differences (including, as applicable,\ndifferences between a security\u2019s price at the\nlocal market close and the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's valuation of a security at\nthe time of calculation of the Fund's or\nUnderlying Fund's NAV, respectively),\ntransaction costs incurred by the Fund, the\nFund\u2019s holding of uninvested cash, differences\nin timing of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s shareholders, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions carried out\nto minimize the distribution of capital gains\nto shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the Underlying Index or the costs\nto the Fund and an underlying fund of\ncomplying with various new or existing\nregulatory requirements, among other reasons.\nThis risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Tracking error also may\nresult because the Fund and an underlying fund\nincurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying\nIndex does not. The underlying funds are also\nsubject to tracking error risk in seeking to\ntrack their own performance of the applicable\nunderlying indexes. U.S. Agency Debt Risk. The\nFund or an Underlying Fund invests in\nunsecured bonds or debentures issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government or one of\nits agencies or sponsored entities. Certain\ndebt issuances by U.S. government agencies or\nsponsored entities, including, among others,\nthe Federal National Mortgage Association ( \u201c\nFannie Mae \u201d ) the Federal Home Loan Mortgage\nCorporation ( \u201c Freddie Mac \u201d ), the Federal\nHome Loan Banks ( \u201c FHLB \u201d ), and the\nTennessee Valley Authority ( \u201c TVA \u201d ), are\nbacked only by the general creditworthiness\nand reputation of the U.S. government agency\nor sponsored entity and not the full faith and\ncredit of the U.S. government and, as a\nresult, are subject to additional credit risk.\nTo the extent that the U.S. government has\nprovided support to a U.S. agency or sponsored\nentity in the past, there can be no assurance\nthat the U.S. government will provide support\nin the future if it is not obligated to do so.\nGovernment National Mortgage Association ( \u201c\nGinnie Mae \u201d ) securities and certain foreign\ngovernment debt issuances guaranteed by the\nU.S. government are backed by the full faith\nand credit of the U.S. government. U.S. Agency\nMortgage-Backed Securities Risk. Certain\nUnderlying Funds invest in mortgage-backed\nsecurities ( \u201c MBS \u201d ) issued or guaranteed by\nthe U.S. government or one of its agencies or\nsponsored entities, some of which may not be\nbacked by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. government. MBS represent interests in \u201c\npools \u201d of mortgages and are subject to\ninterest rate, prepayment, and extension risk.\nMBS react differently to changes in interest\nrates than other bonds, and the prices of MBS\nmay reflect adverse economic and market\nconditions. Small movements in interest rates\n(both increases and decreases) may quickly and\nsignificantly reduce the value of certain MBS.\nMBS are also subject to the risk of default on\nthe underlying mortgage loans, particularly\nduring periods of economic downturn. Default\nor bankruptcy of a counterparty to a to-be-\nannounced ( \u201c TBA \u201d ) transaction would expose\nthe Fund to possible losses. U.S. Government\nIssuers Risk . Obligations of U.S. government\nagencies and authorities are supported by\nvarying degrees of credit, but generally are\nnot backed by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. government. Similar to other issuers,\nchanges to the financial condition or credit\nrating of the U.S. government or U.S.\ngovernment agencies and authorities may cause\nthe value of the Fund's investments to\ndecline. Valuation Risk . The price the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund could receive upon the\nsale of a security or other asset may differ\nfrom the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's\nvaluation of the security or other asset and\nfrom the value used by its underlying index,\nparticularly for securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology as a result of trade suspensions\nor for other reasons. In addition, the value\nof the securities or other assets in the\nFund's or an Underlying Fund's portfolio may\nchange on days or during time periods when\nshareholders will not be able to purchase or\nsell the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's\nshares. Authorized Participants who purchase\nor redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is\nholding fair-valued securities may receive\nfewer or more shares, or lower or higher\nredemption proceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. S-7 Performance\nInformation The bar chart and table that\nfollow show how the Fund has performed on a\ncalendar year basis and provide some\nindication of the risks of investing in the\nFund by showing how the Fund\u2019s average annual\nreturns for 1, 5 and 10 years compare with the\nUnderlying Index.Both assume that all\ndividends and distributions have been\nreinvested in the Fund. Past performance\n(before and after taxes) does not necessarily\nindicate how the Fund will perform in the\nfuture.If BFA had not waived certain Fund fees\nduring certain periods, the Fund's returns\nwould have been lower. Calendar Year by Year\nReturns 1 1 The Fund\u2019s year-to-date returnas\nof September 30, 2023was 3.69%.

As a result, Fund returns after\ntaxes on distributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns before taxes\nand/or returns after taxes on distributions.\n\nS-9\n\nManagement Investment Adviser.

Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase shares of the\nFund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for shares of the Fund (ask)\nwhen buying or selling shares in the secondary\nmarket (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable to you as\nordinary income or capital gains, unless you\nare investing through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA,\nin which case, your distributions generally\nwill be taxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase shares of the\nFund through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA\nor other related companies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or promotion of\nthe Fund. These payments may create a conflict\nof interest by influencing the broker-dealer\nor other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary\u2019s website for more information.\nS-10 More Information About the Fund This\nProspectus contains important information\nabout investing in the Fund. Please read this\nProspectus carefully before you make any\ninvestment decisions. Additional information\nregarding the Fund is available at\nwww.iShares.com. BFA is the investment adviser\nto the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for\ntrading on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. ( \u201c Cboe\nBZX \u201d ). The market price for a share of the\nFund may be different from the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. ETFs are funds that trade like\nother publicly traded securities. The Fund is\ndesigned to track an index. Similar to shares\nof an index mutual fund, each share of the\nFund represents an ownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of securities and other\ninstruments intended to track a market index.\nUnlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be\nbought and redeemed from the issuing fund by\nall shareholders at a price based on NAV,\nshares of the Fund may be purchased or\nredeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely\nby Authorized Participants and only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares (\n\u201c Creation Units \u201d ). Also unlike shares of a\nmutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on\na national securities exchange and trade in\nthe secondary market at market prices that\nchange throughout the day. An index is a\nfinancial calculation, based on a grouping of\nfinancial instruments, and is not an\ninvestment product, while the Fund is an\nactual investment portfolio. The performance\nof the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary\nfor a number of reasons, including transaction\ncosts, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset\nvaluations, corporate actions (such as mergers\nand spin-offs), timing variances and\ndifferences between the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthe Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's\nor each Underlying Fund's use of\nrepresentative sampling or from legal\nrestrictions (such as diversification\nrequirements) that apply to the Fund but not\nto the Underlying Index. From time to time,\nthe Index Provider may make changes to the\nmethodology or other adjustments to the\nUnderlying Index. Unless otherwise determined\nby BFA, any such change or adjustment will be\nreflected in the calculation of the Underlying\nIndex performance on a going-forward basis\nafter the effective date of such change or\nadjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index\nperformance shown for periods prior to the\neffective date of any such change or\nadjustment will generally not be recalculated\nor restated to reflect such change or\nadjustment. Because the Fund uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing strategy, it\ncan be expected to have a larger tracking\nerror than if it used a replication indexing\nstrategy. \u201c Replication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests in\nsubstantially all of the securities in its\nunderlying index in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying index. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not a bank deposit\nand it is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any\nother government agency, BFA or any of its\naffiliates. The Fund's investment objective\nand the Underlying Index may be changed\nwithout shareholder approval. A Further\nDiscussion of Principal Risks The Fund is\nsubject to various risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below, any of which may\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV, trading\nprice, yield, total return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. The Fund may be\nexposed to these risks directly or indirectly\nthrough the Fund's investments in the\nUnderlying Funds. You could lose all or part\nof your investment in the Fund, and the Fund\ncould underperform other investments. The\norder of the below risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any particular\nrisk factor. The Fund discloses its portfolio\nholdings daily at www.iShares.com. Affiliated\nFund Risk. In managing the Fund, BFA has the\nability to select Underlying Funds and\nsubstitute other ETFs which it believes will\nachieve the Fund\u2019s objective. BFA may be\nsubject to potential conflicts of interest in\nselecting Underlying Funds and substituting\nother ETFs because the fees paid to BFA by\nsome Underlying Funds and other ETFs managed\nby BFA may be higher than the fees paid by\nother Underlying Funds. If an Underlying Fund\nor other ETF holds interests in an affiliated\nfund, the Fund may be prohibited from\npurchasing shares of that Underlying Fund or\nother ETF. Allocation Risk. The Fund\u2019s ability\nto achieve its investment objective depends\nupon the Index Provider\u2019s ability to develop a\nmodel that accurately assesses the Fund\u2019s\nasset class allocation and selects the best\nmix of Underlying Funds and other ETFs. There\nis a risk that the Index Provider\u2019s\nevaluations and assumptions regarding asset\nclasses or Underlying Funds, which are\nutilized as inputs in the model, may be\nincorrect in view of actual market conditions.\nThe Fund\u2019s Underlying Index may overweight\ncertain asset classes relative to market\ncapitalization-weighted benchmarks. The Fund\nwill underperform such benchmarks when asset\nclasses that are overweighted in the Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index underperform other asset\nclasses. Asset Class Risk. The securities and\nother assets in the Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's portfolio may\nunderperform in comparison to other securities\nor indexes that track other countries, groups\nof countries, regions, industries, groups of\nindustries, markets, market segments, asset\nclasses or sectors. Various types of\nsecurities, currencies and indexes may\nexperience cycles of outperformance and\nunderperformance in comparison to the general\nfinancial markets depending upon a number of\nfactors including, among other things,\ninflation, interest rates, productivity,\nglobal demand for local products or resources,\nand regulation and governmental controls. This\nmay cause the Fund to underperform other\ninvestment vehicles that invest in different\nasset classes. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund, and none of those Authorized\nParticipants is obligated to engage in\ncreation and/or redemption transactions. The\nFund has a limited number of institutions that\nmay act as Authorized Participants on an\nagency basis ( i.e. , on behalf of other\nmarket participants). To the 1 extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the business or\nare unable to proceed with creation or\nredemption orders with respect to the Fund and\nno other Authorized Participant is able to\nstep forward to create or redeem Creation\nUnits, Fund shares may be more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV and possibly\nface trading halts or delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk may be\nheightened because ETFs, such as the Fund,\nthat invest in securities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers or other securities or instruments\nthat are less widely traded often involve\ngreater settlement and operational issues and\ncapital costs for Authorized Participants,\nwhich may limit the availability of Authorized\nParticipants. Calculation Methodology Risk.\nThe Index Provider relies on various sources\nof information to assess the criteria of\ncomponents of the Underlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on assumptions\nand estimates. Neither the Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index Provider's\ncalculation methodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an accurate\nassessment of included components. Call Risk.\nDuring periods of falling interest rates, an\nissuer of a callable bond held by the Fund and\nan Underlying Fund may \u201c call \u201d or repay the\nsecurity before its stated maturity, and the\nFund and an Underlying Fund may have to\nreinvest the proceeds in securities with lower\nyields, which would result in a decline in the\nFund\u2019s income, or in securities with greater\nrisks or with other less favorable features.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk of loss,\nincluding losses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent that the\nFund's or an Underlying Fund's investments are\nconcentrated in the securities and/or other\nassets of a particular issuer or issuers,\ncountry, group of countries, region, market,\nindustry, group of industries, project types,\ngroup of project types, sector, market segment\nor asset class. The Fund may be more adversely\naffected by the underperformance of those\nsecurities and/or other assets, may experience\nincreased price volatility and may be more\nsusceptible to adverse economic, market,\npolitical or regulatory occurrences affecting\nthose securities and/or other assets than a\nfund that does not concentrate its\ninvestments. Credit Risk. Credit risk is the\nrisk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt\ninstrument or the counterparty to a\nderivatives contract, repurchase agreement or\nloan of portfolio securities will be unable or\nunwilling to make its timely interest and/or\nprincipal payments when due or otherwise honor\nits obligations. There are varying degrees of\ncredit risk, depending on an issuer\u2019s or\ncounterparty\u2019s financial condition and on the\nterms of an obligation, which may be reflected\nin the issuer\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s credit\nrating. There is the chance that the Fund\u2019s or\nan Underlying Fund's portfolio holdings will\nhave their credit ratings downgraded or will\ndefault ( i.e., fail to make scheduled\ninterest or principal payments), or that the\nmarket\u2019s perception of an issuer\u2019s\ncreditworthiness may worsen, potentially\nreducing such Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\nincome level or share price, which may\nadversely affect the value of the Fund.\nCurrency Risk. Because the Fund's and the\nUnderlying Funds' NAVs are determined on the\nbasis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose\nmoney if the currency of a non-U.S. market in\nwhich the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on repatriation of\nsuch currency, even if such currency value of\nthe Fund's holdings in that market increases.\nCurrency exchange rates can be very volatile\nand can change quickly and unpredictably. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and\nwithout warning. Cybersecurity Risk. The Fund,\nthe Underlying Funds, Authorized Participants,\nservice providers and the relevant listing\nexchange are susceptible to operational,\ninformation security and related \u201c cyber \u201d\nrisks both directly and through their service\nproviders. Similar types of cybersecurity\nrisks are also present for issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds invest, which could result in material\nadverse consequences for such issuers and may\ncause the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestment in such issuers to lose value. In\ngeneral, cyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or unintentional events.\nCyber incidents include, but are not limited\nto, gaining unauthorized access to digital\nsystems ( e.g. , through \u201c hacking \u201d or\nmalicious software coding) for purposes of\nmisappropriating assets or sensitive\ninformation, corrupting data, or causing\noperational disruption. Cyberattacks may also\nbe carried out in a manner that does not\nrequire gaining unauthorized access, such as\ncausing denial-of-service attacks on websites\n( i.e. , efforts to make network services\nunavailable to intended users). Geopolitical\ntensions may increase the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate attacks,\nparticularly those from nation-states or from\nentities with nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the\nsystems of the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's\nadviser, distributor and other service\nproviders (including, but not limited to,\nindex and benchmark providers, fund\naccountants, custodians, transfer agents and\nadministrators), market makers, Authorized\nParticipants or the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund or the Underlying Funds invest\nhave the ability to cause disruptions and\nimpact business operations, potentially\nresulting in: financial losses, interference\nwith the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\nability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of\nconfidential trading information, impediments\nto trading, submission of erroneous trades or\nerroneous creation or redemption orders, the\ninability of the Fund, each Underlying Fund or\ntheir service providers to transact business,\nviolations of applicable privacy and other\nlaws, regulatory fines, penalties,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, or additional compliance\ncosts. In addition, cyberattacks may render\nrecords of Fund assets and transactions,\nshareholder ownership of Fund shares, and\nother data integral to the functioning of the\nFund or an Underlying Fund inaccessible,\ninaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs\nmay be incurred by the Fund or an Underlying\nFund in order to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. While the Fund and the Underlying\nFunds have established business continuity\nplans in the event of, and risk management\nsystems to prevent, such cyber incidents,\nthere are inherent limitations in such plans\nand systems, including the possibility that\ncertain risks have not been identified, that\nprevention and remediation efforts will not be\nsuccessful or that cyberattacks will go\nundetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems\nput in place by service providers to the Fund,\nissuers in which the Fund invests, the Index\nProvider, market makers or Authorized\nParticipants. The Fund and its shareholders\ncould be negatively impacted as a result. 2\nDividend-Paying Stock Risk. Investing in\ndividend-paying stocks involves the risk that\nsuch stocks may fall out of favor with\ninvestors and underperform the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-paying stocks\nare not required to pay or continue paying\ndividends on such stocks. It is possible that\nissuers of the stocks held by the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund will not declare dividends in\nthe future or will reduce or eliminate the\npayment of dividends (including reducing or\neliminating anticipated accelerations or\nincreases in the payment of dividends) in the\nfuture. Equity Securities Risk. Certain\nUnderlying Funds invest in equity securities,\nwhich are subject to changes in value that may\nbe attributable to market perception of a\nparticular issuer or to general stock market\nfluctuations that affect all issuers.\nInvestments in equity securities may be more\nvolatile than investments in other asset\nclasses. The Underlying Index is composed of\ncommon stocks, which generally subject their\nholders to more risks than preferred stocks\nand debt securities because common\nstockholders' claims are subordinated to those\nof holders of preferred stocks and debt\nsecurities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.\nFinancials Sector Risk. Companies in the\nfinancials sector are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation and intervention,\nwhich may adversely affect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, the\namount of capital and liquid assets they must\nmaintain and, potentially, their size.\nGovernmental regulation may change frequently\nand may have significant adverse consequences\nfor companies in the financials sector,\nincluding effects not intended by such\nregulation. Increased risk taking by financial\ncompanies may also result in greater overall\nrisk in the U.S. and global financials sector.\nThe impact of changes in capital requirements,\nor recent or future regulation in various\ncountries, on any individual financial company\nor on the financials sector as a whole cannot\nbe predicted. Certain risks may impact the\nvalue of investments in the financials sector\nmore severely than those of investments\noutside this sector, including the risks\nassociated with companies that operate with\nsubstantial financial leverage. Companies in\nthe financials sector are exposed directly to\nthe credit risk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products. Financial services\ncompanies may have significant exposure to the\nsame borrowers and counterparties, with the\nresult that a borrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s\ninability to meet its obligations to one\ncompany may affect other companies with\nexposure to the same borrower or counterparty.\nThis interconnectedness of risk may result in\nsignificant negative impacts to companies with\ndirect exposure to the defaulting counterparty\nas well as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nCompanies in the financials sector may also be\nadversely affected by increases in interest\nrates and loan losses, decreases in the\navailability of money or asset valuations,\ncredit rating downgrades, adverse public\nperception and adverse conditions in other\nrelated markets. Insurance companies, in\nparticular, may be subject to severe price\ncompetition and/or rate regulation, which may\nhave an adverse impact on their profitability.\nThe financials sector is particularly\nsensitive to fluctuations in interest rates.\nThe financials sector is also a target for\ncyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents and\ntechnology malfunctions and failures have\nbecome increasingly frequent and have caused\nsignificant losses to companies in this\nsector, which may negatively impact an\nUnderlying Fund. The extent to which the Fund\nmay invest in a company that engages in\nsecurities-related activities or banking is\nlimited by applicable law. Geographic Risk.\nSome of the companies in which the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund invests are located in parts\nof the world that have historically been prone\nto natural disasters such as earthquakes,\ntornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts,\nfloods, hurricanes or tsunamis and are\neconomically sensitive to environmental\nevents. Any such event may adversely impact\nthe economies of these geographic areas or\nbusiness operations of companies in these\ngeographic areas, causing an adverse impact on\nthe value of the Fund. High Yield Securities\nRisk. Securities that are rated below\ninvestment-grade (commonly referred to as \u201c\njunk bonds, \u201d which may include those bonds\nrated below \u201c BBB- \u201d by S&P Global Ratings and\nFitch, or below \u201c Baa3 \u201d by Moody\u2019s), or are\nunrated, may be deemed speculative, may\ninvolve greater levels of risk than higher-\nrated securities of similar maturity and may\nbe more likely to default. The major risks of\nhigh yield securities investments include: \u25a0\nHigh yield securities may be issued by less\ncreditworthy issuers. Issuers of high yield\nsecurities may have a larger amount of\noutstanding debt relative to their assets than\nissuers of investment-grade bonds. In the\nevent of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy, claims of\nother creditors may have priority over the\nclaims of high yield securities holders,\nleaving few or no assets available to repay\nhigh yield securities holders. \u25a0 Prices of\nhigh yield securities are subject to extreme\nprice fluctuations. Adverse changes in an\nissuer\u2019s industry and general economic\nconditions may have a greater impact on the\nprices of high yield securities than on other\nhigher rated fixed-income securities. The\ncredit rating of a high yield security does\nnot necessarily address its market value risk.\nRatings and market value may change from time\nto time, positively or negatively, to reflect\nnew developments regarding the issuer. \u25a0\nIssuers of high yield securities may be unable\nto meet their interest or principal payment\nobligations because of an economic downturn,\nspecific issuer developments, or the\nunavailability of additional financing. \u25a0 High\nyield securities frequently have redemption\nfeatures that permit an issuer to repurchase\nthe security from the Fund or an Underlying\nFund before it matures. If the issuer redeems\nhigh yield securities held by the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund, the Fund or an Underlying\nFund may have to invest the proceeds in bonds\nwith lower yields and may lose income. \u25a0 High\nyield securities may be less liquid than\nhigher rated fixed-income securities, even\nunder normal economic conditions. There are\nfewer dealers in the high yield securities\nmarket, and there may be significant\ndifferences in the prices quoted for high\nyield securities by the dealers. Because high\nyield securities may be less liquid than\nhigher rated fixed-income securities, judgment\nmay play a greater role in valuing certain of\nan Underlying Fund's securities than is the\ncase with securities trading in a more liquid\nmarket. \u25a0 An Underlying Fund may incur\nexpenses to the extent necessary to seek\nrecovery upon default or to negotiate new\nterms with a defaulting issuer. 3 Income Risk.\nThe Fund\u2019s income may decline if interest\nrates fall. This decline in income can occur\nbecause the Fund or an Underlying Fund may\nsubsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as\nbonds in its portfolio mature, are near\nmaturity or are called; or the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund otherwise needs to purchase\nadditional bonds. Indexing Investment Risk.\nThe Fund and the Underlying Funds are not\nactively managed and may be affected by a\ngeneral decline in market segments related to\nthe Underlying Indexes. The Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds invest in securities included\nin, or representative of, the applicable\nunderlying index, regardless of their\ninvestment merits. BFA generally does not\nattempt to invest the Fund's assets in\ndefensive positions under any market\nconditions, including declining markets.\nIndex-Related Risk. The Fund seeks to achieve\na return that corresponds generally to the\nprice and yield performance, before fees and\nexpenses, of the Underlying Index as published\nby the Index Provider. There is no assurance\nthat the Index Provider or any agents that may\nact on its behalf will compile the Underlying\nIndex accurately, or that the Underlying Index\nwill be determined, composed or calculated\naccurately. While the Index Provider provides\ndescriptions of what the Underlying Index is\ndesigned to achieve, neither the Index\nProvider nor its agents provide any warranty\nor accept any liability in relation to the\nquality, accuracy or completeness of the\nUnderlying Index or its related data, and they\ndo not guarantee that the Underlying Index\nwill be in line with the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology. BFA\u2019s mandate as described in\nthis Prospectus is to manage the Fund\nconsistently with the Underlying Index\nprovided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA\ndoes not provide any warranty or guarantee\nagainst the Index Provider\u2019s or any agent\u2019s\nerrors. Errors in respect of the quality,\naccuracy and completeness of the data used to\ncompile the Underlying Index may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and\ncorrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, particularly where the\nindices are less commonly used as benchmarks\nby funds or managers. In addition, there may\nbe heightened risks associated with the\nadequacy and reliability of the information\nthe Index Provider uses given the Fund's\nexposure to emerging markets, as certain\nemerging markets may have less information\navailable or less regulatory oversight. Such\nerrors may negatively or positively impact the\nFund and its shareholders. For example, during\na period where the Underlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund would have\nmarket exposure to such constituents and would\nbe underexposed to the Underlying Index\u2019s\nother constituents. Shareholders should\nunderstand that any gains from Index Provider\nerrors will be kept by the Fund and its\nshareholders and any losses or costs resulting\nfrom Index Provider errors will be borne by\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters, political unrest\nor war) may impact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider, and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a scheduled\nrebalance to the Underlying Index. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to vary from its\nnormal or expected composition. The\npostponement of a scheduled rebalance could\nmean that constituents of the Underlying Index\nthat would otherwise be removed at rebalance\ndue to changes in market capitalizations,\nissuer credit ratings, or other reasons may\nremain, causing the performance and\nconstituents of the Underlying Index to vary\nfrom those expected under normal conditions.\nApart from scheduled rebalances, the Index\nProvider or its agents may carry out\nadditional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying\nIndex due to reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market conditions or\ncorporate events or, for example, to correct\nan error in the selection of index\nconstituents. When the Underlying Index is\nrebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its\nportfolio to attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthe Underlying Index, any transaction costs\nand market exposure arising from such\nportfolio rebalancing will be borne directly\nby the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore,\nerrors and additional ad hoc rebalances\ncarried out by the Index Provider or its\nagents to the Underlying Index may increase\nthe costs to and the tracking error risk of\nthe Fund. Similar risks exist for the\nUnderlying Funds in tracking their benchmarks,\nwhich may result in the Fund's performance\ndeviating from the return of the Underlying\nIndex. Infectious Illness Risk. A widespread\noutbreak of an infectious illness, such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the\neconomies of many nations and the global\neconomy and may impact individual issuers and\ncapital markets in ways that cannot be\nforeseen. An infectious illness outbreak may\nresult in travel restrictions, closed\ninternational borders, disruption of\nhealthcare services, prolonged quarantines,\ncancellations, supply chain disruptions, lower\nconsumer demand, temporary and permanent\nclosures of businesses, layoffs, defaults and\nother significant economic, social and\npolitical impacts, as well as general concern\nand uncertainty. An infectious illness\noutbreak may result in extreme volatility,\nsevere losses, credit deterioration of\nissuers, and disruptions in markets, which\ncould adversely impact the Fund and its\ninvestments, including impairing any hedging\nactivity. Certain local markets may be subject\nto closures. Any suspension of trading in\nmarkets in which the Fund or an Underlying\nFund invests will have an impact on the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund and its investments and\nwill impact the Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or\nsell securities in such markets. Market or\neconomic disruptions could result in elevated\ntracking error and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an\noutbreak could impair the operations of the\nFund\u2019s service providers, including BFA, which\ncould adversely impact the Fund. Governmental\nand quasi-governmental authorities and\nregulators throughout the world may respond to\nan outbreak and any resulting economic\ndisruptions with a variety of fiscal and\nmonetary policy changes, including direct\ncapital infusions into companies and other\nissuers, new monetary policy tools, and\nchanges in interest rates. A reversal of these\npolicies, or the ineffectiveness of such\npolicies, is likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's investments. An\noutbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing\npolitical, social and economic risks in\ncertain countries or globally, which could\nadversely affect the Fund and its investments\nand could result in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund's NAV. Despite the\ndevelopment of vaccines, the duration of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and its effects cannot be\npredicted with certainty. 4 Interest Rate\nRisk. If interest rates rise, the value of\nfixed-income securities or other instruments\nheld by the Fund or an Underlying Fund would\nlikely decrease. A measure investors commonly\nuse to determine this price sensitivity is\ncalled duration. Fixed-income securities with\nlonger durations tend to be more sensitive to\ninterest rate changes, usually making their\nprices more volatile than those of securities\nwith shorter durations. For example, if a bond\nhas a duration of five years and interest\nrates rise, the price of the bond will likely\ndecline by a greater percentage than if the\nbond had a one year duration. To the extent\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund invests a\nsubstantial portion of its assets in fixed-\nincome securities with longer duration, rising\ninterest rates may cause the value of the\nFund's or an Underlying Fund's investments to\ndecline significantly, which would adversely\naffect the value of the Fund. An increase in\ninterest rates may lead to heightened\nvolatility in the fixed-income markets and\nadversely affect certain fixed-income\ninvestments, including those held by the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund. Because rates on\ncertain floating rate debt securities\ntypically reset only periodically, changes in\nprevailing interest rates (and particularly\nsudden and significant changes) can be\nexpected to cause some fluctuations in the net\nasset value of the Underlying Fund to the\nextent that it invests in floating rate debt\nsecurities. In addition, decreases in fixed-\nincome dealer market-making capacity may lead\nto lower trading volume, heightened\nvolatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less\ntransparent pricing in certain fixed-income\nmarkets. The historically low interest rate\nenvironment in recent years was created in\npart by the world\u2019s major central banks\nkeeping their overnight policy interest rates\nat, near or below zero percent and\nimplementing monetary policy facilities, such\nas asset purchase programs, to anchor longer-\nterm interest rates below historical levels.\nDuring periods of very low or negative\ninterest rates, the Fund may be unable to\nmaintain positive returns or pay dividends to\nFund shareholders. Certain countries have\nrecently experienced negative interest rates\non certain fixed-income instruments. Very low\nor negative interest rates may magnify\ninterest rate risk. Changing interest rates,\nincluding rates that fall below zero, may have\nunpredictable effects on markets, result in\nheightened market volatility and detract from\nthe Fund\u2019s performance to the extent the Fund\nis exposed to such interest rates.\nAdditionally, under certain market conditions\nin which interest rates are set at low levels\nand the market prices of portfolio securities\nhave increased, the Fund or an Underlying Fund\nmay have a very low or even negative yield. A\nlow or negative yield would cause the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund to lose money in certain\nconditions and over certain time periods.\nCentral banks may increase their short-term\npolicy rates or begin phasing out, or \u201c\ntapering, \u201d accommodative monetary policy\nfacilities in the future. The timing,\ncoordination, magnitude and effect of such\npolicy changes on various markets are\nuncertain, and such changes in monetary policy\nmay adversely affect the value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. Investment in Underlying Funds\nRisk. The Fund expects to invest substantially\nall of its assets in the Underlying Funds, so\nthe Fund\u2019s investment performance is directly\nrelated to the performance of the Underlying\nFunds. The Fund may also invest in other\nfunds, including money market funds. The\nFund\u2019s NAV will change with changes in the\nvalue of the Underlying Funds and other\nsecurities in which the Fund invests based on\ntheir market valuations. An investment in the\nFund will entail more direct and indirect\ncosts and expenses than a direct investment in\nthe Underlying Funds. For example, in addition\nto the expenses of the Fund, the Fund\nindirectly pays a portion of the expenses\n(including operating expenses and management\nfees) incurred by the Underlying Funds,\nalthough some of such fees will be offset by\nthe fee waiver by BFA. One Underlying Fund may\nbuy the same securities that another\nUnderlying Fund sells. Also, an investor in\nthe Fund may receive taxable gains from\nportfolio transactions by the Underlying\nFunds, as well as taxable gains from\ntransactions in shares of the Underlying Funds\nheld by the Fund. Certain of the funds may\nalso hold common portfolio securities. As the\nUnderlying Funds, or the Fund's allocations\namong the Underlying Funds, change from time\nto time, or to the extent that the total\nannual fund operating expenses of the\nUnderlying Funds change, the weighted average\noperating expenses borne by the Fund may\nincrease or decrease. Issuer Risk. The\nperformance of the Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual securities to which\nthe Fund or the Underlying Funds have\nexposure. The Fund may be adversely affected\nif an issuer of underlying securities held by\nthe Fund is unable or unwilling to repay\nprincipal or interest when due. Any issuer of\nthese securities may perform poorly, causing\nthe value of its securities to decline. Poor\nperformance may be caused by poor management\ndecisions, competitive pressures, changes in\ntechnology, expiration of patent protection,\ndisruptions in supply, labor problems or\nshortages, corporate restructurings,\nfraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration\nof the issuer or other factors. Issuers may,\nin times of distress or at their own\ndiscretion, decide to reduce or eliminate\ndividends, which may also cause their stock\nprices to decline. An issuer may also be\nsubject to risks associated with the\ncountries, states and regions in which the\nissuer resides, invests, sells products, or\notherwise conducts operations. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller capitalization companies to adapt to\nchanging market conditions. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller capitalization\ncompanies. During different market cycles, the\nperformance of large-capitalization companies\nhas trailed the overall performance of the\nbroader securities markets. Management Risk.\nBecause BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy, the Fund will not fully\nreplicate the Underlying Index and may hold\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex. As a result, the Fund is subject to the\nrisk that BFA\u2019s investment strategy, the\nimplementation of which is subject to a number\nof constraints, may not produce the intended\nresults. Market Risk. The Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. The value of a financial\ninstrument or other asset may decline due to\nchanges in general market conditions, economic\ntrends or events that are not specifically\nrelated to the particular instrument or asset,\nor factors that affect one or more issuers,\ncounterparties, exchanges, countries, regions,\nmarkets, industries, sectors or asset classes,\nas applicable. Local, regional or 5 global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism, public\nhealth issues, recessions, the prospect or\noccurrence of a sovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund, the Underlying\nFunds and their investments and could result\nin increased premiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's NAV. Changes in\nmarket and economic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all types of\ninstruments and assets. Market Trading Risk.\nAbsence of Active Market. Although shares of\nthe Fund and the Underlying Funds are listed\nfor trading on one or more stock exchanges,\nthere can be no assurance that an active\ntrading market for such shares will develop or\nbe maintained by market makers or Authorized\nParticipants. Risk of Secondary Listings. The\nFund's and each Underlying Fund's shares may\nbe listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock\nexchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange\nwhere the Fund's or each Underlying Fund's\nprimary listing is maintained, and may\notherwise be made available to non-U.S.\ninvestors through funds or structured\ninvestment vehicles similar to depositary\nreceipts. There can be no assurance that the\nFund\u2019s shares will continue to trade on any\nsuch stock exchange or in any market or that\nthe Fund\u2019s shares will continue to meet the\nrequirements for listing or trading on any\nexchange or in any market. The Fund's or each\nUnderlying Fund's shares may be less actively\ntraded in certain markets than in others, and\ninvestors are subject to the execution and\nsettlement risks and market standards of the\nmarket where they or their broker direct their\ntrades for execution. Certain information\navailable to investors who trade Fund shares\non a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S.\nmarket hours may not be available to investors\nwho trade in other markets, which may result\nin secondary market prices in such markets\nbeing less efficient. Secondary Market Trading\nRisk. Shares of the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds may trade in the secondary market at\ntimes when the Fund or the Underlying Funds do\nnot accept orders to purchase or redeem\nshares. At such times, shares may trade in the\nsecondary market with more significant\npremiums or discounts than might be\nexperienced at times when the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds accept purchase and\nredemption orders. If the Fund purchases\nshares of an Underlying Fund at a time when\nthe market price of Underlying Fund shares is\nat a premium to their NAV or sells Underlying\nFund shares when their market price is at a\ndiscount to their NAV, the Fund may incur\nlosses. Secondary market trading in Fund\nshares may be halted by a stock exchange\nbecause of market conditions or for other\nreasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares\non a stock exchange or in any market may be\nsubject to trading halts caused by\nextraordinary market volatility pursuant to \u201c\ncircuit breaker \u201d rules on the stock exchange\nor market. Shares of the Fund or an Underlying\nFund, similar to shares of other issuers\nlisted on a stock exchange, may be sold short\nand are therefore subject to the risk of\nincreased volatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short. In addition,\ntrading activity in derivative products based\non the Fund or an Underlying Fund may lead to\nincreased trading volume and volatility in the\nsecondary market for the shares of the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund. Shares of the Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds May Trade at Prices Other\nThan NAV. Shares of the Fund and an Underlying\nFund each trade on stock exchanges at prices\nat, above or below the Fund\u2019s and the\nUnderlying Fund's most recent respective NAV.\nThe NAV of the Fund and each Underlying Fund\nare calculated at the end of each business day\nand fluctuate with changes in the market value\nof the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\nholdings. The trading price of each of the\nFund's and Underlying Funds' shares fluctuates\ncontinuously throughout trading hours based on\nboth market supply of and demand for their\nshares and the underlying value of their\nportfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the\ntrading prices of the Fund\u2019s and each\nUnderlying Fund's shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during periods of\nmarket volatility. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG\nOTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE\nUNDERLYING FUNDS' SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM\nOR DISCOUNT TO NAV . However, because shares\ncan be created and redeemed in Creation Units\nat NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or\npremiums to the NAV of the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds, as applicable, are not\nlikely to be sustained over the long term\n(unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable discounts\nfrom, and sometimes at premiums to, their\nNAVs). While the creation/redemption feature\nis designed to make it more likely that the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's shares normally\nwill trade on stock exchanges at prices close\nto the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's next\ncalculated NAV, exchange prices are not\nexpected to correlate exactly with their\nrespective NAV due to timing reasons, supply\nand demand imbalances and other factors. In\naddition, disruptions to creations and\nredemptions, including disruptions at market\nmakers, Authorized Participants, or other\nmarket participants, and during periods of\nsignificant market volatility, may result in\ntrading prices for shares of the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund that differ significantly from\ntheir respective NAV. Authorized Participants\nmay be less willing to create or redeem Fund\nshares if there is a lack of an active market\nfor such shares or its underlying investments,\nwhich may contribute to the Fund\u2019s or the\nUnderlying Fund's shares trading at a premium\nor discount to NAV. Costs of Buying or Selling\nFund Shares. Buying or selling Fund shares on\nan exchange involves two types of costs that\napply to all securities transactions. When\nbuying or selling shares of the Fund through a\nbroker, you will likely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c spread \u201d ; that\nis, the difference between what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares (the \u201c bid \u201d\nprice) and the price at which they are willing\nto sell Fund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price). The\nspread, which varies over time for shares of\nthe Fund based on trading volume and market\nliquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund\nhas more trading volume and market liquidity\nand wider if the Fund has less trading volume\nand market liquidity. In addition, increased\nmarket volatility may cause wider spreads.\nThere may also be regulatory and other charges\nthat are incurred as a result of trading\nactivity. Because of the costs inherent in\nbuying or selling Fund shares, frequent\ntrading may detract significantly from\ninvestment results and an investment in Fund\nshares may not be advisable for investors who\nanticipate regularly making small investments\nthrough a brokerage account. 6 Mid-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Stock prices of\nmid-capitalization companies may be more\nvolatile than those of large-capitalization\ncompanies and therefore the share price of an\nUnderlying Fund that invests mostly in mid-\ncapitalization companies may increase or\ndecrease by a greater percentage than those of\nfunds that invest solely in stocks issued by\nlarge-capitalization companies. Stock prices\nof mid-capitalization companies are also more\nvulnerable than large-capitalization stocks to\nadverse business or economic developments and\nthe stocks of mid-capitalization companies may\nbe less liquid, making it difficult for the\nFund or an Underlying Fund to buy and sell\nthem. In addition, mid-capitalization\ncompanies generally have less diverse product\nlines than large-capitalization companies and\nare more susceptible to adverse developments\nrelated to their products. Model Risk. Neither\nthe Fund nor BFA can offer any assurance that\nthe allocation model used to calculate the\nUnderlying Index will achieve its intended\nresults or maximize returns or minimize risks,\nnor can the Fund or BFA offer assurance that a\nparticular allocation will be the appropriate\nallocation in all circumstances for every\ninvestor seeking a particular risk profile or\ntime horizon. Non-U.S. Issuers Risk .\nSecurities issued by non-U.S. issuers have\ndifferent risks from securities issued by U.S.\nissuers. These risks include differences in\naccounting, auditing and financial reporting\nstandards, the possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation, adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations,\npolitical instability which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in non-U.S. countries,\nuncertainties of transnational litigation, and\npotential restrictions on the flow of\ninternational capital, including the possible\nseizure or nationalization of the securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers held by the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund. Non-U.S. issuers may be\nsubject to less governmental regulation than\nU.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S.\neconomies may differ favorably or unfavorably\nfrom the U.S. economy in such respects as\ngrowth of gross domestic product, rate of\ninflation, capital reinvestment, resource\nself-sufficiency and balance of payment\npositions. Unfavorable political, economic or\ngovernmental developments in non-U.S.\ncountries could affect the payment of a\nsecurity\u2019s principal and interest. Securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers may also be less\nliquid than, and more difficult to value than,\nsecurities of U.S. issuers. In addition, the\nvalue of these securities may fluctuate due to\nchanges in the exchange rate of the issuer\u2019s\nlocal currency against the U.S. dollar.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk. Investments in the\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to\nthe risks of investing in the markets where\nsuch issuers are located, including heightened\nrisks of inflation, nationalization and market\nfluctuations caused by economic and political\ndevelopments. As a result of investing in\nnon-U.S. securities, the Underlying Funds that\ninvests in foreign securities may be subject\nto increased risk of loss caused by any of the\nfactors listed below: \u25a0 Government\nintervention in issuers' operations or\nstructure; \u25a0 A lack of market liquidity and\nmarket efficiency; \u25a0 Greater securities price\nvolatility; \u25a0 Exchange rate fluctuations and\nexchange controls; \u25a0 Less availability of\npublic information about issuers; \u25a0\nLimitations on foreign ownership of\nsecurities; \u25a0 Imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; \u25a0 Imposition of restrictions on\nthe expatriation of the funds or other assets\nof an Underlying Fund; \u25a0 Higher transaction\nand custody costs and delays in settlement\nprocedures; \u25a0 Difficulties in enforcing\ncontractual obligations; \u25a0 Lower levels of\nregulation of the securities markets; \u25a0 Weaker\naccounting, disclosure and reporting\nrequirements and the risk of being delisted\nfrom U.S. exchanges; and \u25a0 Legal principles\nrelating to corporate governance, directors\u2019\nfiduciary duties and liabilities and\nstockholders\u2019 rights in markets in which the\nUnderlying Funds may invest may differ from or\nmay not be as extensive or protective as those\nthat apply in the U.S. Withholding Tax\nReclaims Risk . The Fund or the Underlying\nFund may file claims to recover withholding\ntax on dividend and interest income (if any)\nreceived from issuers in certain countries\nwhere such withholding tax reclaim is\npossible. Whether or when the Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund will receive a withholding tax\nrefund in the future is within the control of\nthe tax authorities in such countries. Where\nthe Fund or the Underlying Fund expects to\nrecover withholding tax based on a continuous\nassessment of probability of recovery, the NAV\nof the Fund or the Underlying Fund generally\nincludes accruals for such tax refunds. The\nFund and the Underlying Fund continue to\nevaluate tax developments for potential impact\nto the probability of recovery. If the\nlikelihood of receiving refunds materially\ndecreases, for example due to a change in tax\nregulation or approach, accruals in the Fund\u2019s\nor the Underlying Fund's NAV for such refunds\nmay need to be written down partially or in\nfull, which will adversely affect that Fund\u2019s\nor the Underlying Fund's NAV. Investors in the\nFund or the Underlying Fund at the time an\naccrual is written down will bear the impact\nof any resulting reduction in NAV regardless\nof whether they were investors during the\naccrual period. Conversely, if a Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund receives a tax refund that has\nnot been previously accrued, investors in the\nFund or the Underlying Fund at the time the\nclaim is successful will benefit from any\nresulting increase in the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nInvestors who sold their shares prior to such\ntime will not benefit from such NAV or the\nUnderlying Fund's increase. Operational Risk.\nThe Fund and the Underlying Funds are exposed\nto operational risks arising from a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, human\nerror, processing and communication errors,\nerrors of the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's\nservice providers, counterparties or other\nthird parties, failed or inadequate processes\nand technology or systems failures. The Fund,\nthe Underlying Funds and BFA seek to 7 reduce\nthese operational risks through controls and\nprocedures. However, these measures do not\naddress every possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant operational\nrisks. Privately Issued Securities Risk. The\nFund or the Underlying Funds may invest in\nprivately issued securities, including those\nthat are normally purchased pursuant to Rule\n144A or Regulation S under the 1933 Act.\nPrivately issued securities typically may be\nresold only to qualified institutional buyers,\nor in a privately negotiated transaction, or\nto a limited number of purchasers, or in\nlimited quantities after they have been held\nfor a specified period of time and other\nconditions are met for an exemption from\nregistration. Because there may be relatively\nfew potential purchasers for such securities,\nespecially under adverse market or economic\nconditions or in the event of adverse changes\nin the financial condition of the issuer, the\nFund and an Underlying Fund may find it more\ndifficult to sell such securities when it may\nbe advisable to do so or it may be able to\nsell such securities only at prices lower than\nif such securities were more widely held and\ntraded. At times, it also may be more\ndifficult to determine the fair value of such\nsecurities for purposes of computing the\nFund\u2019s NAV due to the absence of an active\ntrading market. There can be no assurance that\na privately issued security that is deemed to\nbe liquid when purchased will continue to be\nliquid for as long as it is held by the Fund\nand an Underlying Fund, and its value may\ndecline as a result. Reinvestment Risk . A\nFund or an Underlying Fund may invest a\nportion of its assets in short-term fixed-\nincome instruments and as a result, may be\nadversely affected when interest rates fall\nbecause they may have to invest in lower\nyielding bonds as bonds mature. This may cause\nthe Fund's or an Underlying Fund's income to\ndecline, which may adversely affect the value\nof the Fund. This risk is typically greater\nwith respect to short-term bond funds and\nlower for long-term bond funds. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk. The economies of many\ncountries or regions in which certain of the\nUnderlying Funds invest are highly dependent\non trading with certain key trading partners.\nReduction in spending on products and services\nby these key trading partners, institution of\ntariffs or other trade barriers or a slowdown\nin the economies of key trading partners may\nadversely affect the performance of any\ncompany in which such Underlying Funds invest\nand may have a material adverse effect on the\nUnderlying Funds' performance. Risk of\nInvesting in China. Investments in Chinese\nissuers subject certain Underlying Funds to\nrisks specific to China. The Chinese economy\nis subject to a considerable degree of\neconomic, political and social instability.\nPolitical and Social Risk. The Chinese\ngovernment is authoritarian and has\nperiodically used force to suppress civil\ndissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of\neconomic liberalization may lead to social\nturmoil, violence and labor unrest. In\naddition, China continues to experience\ndisagreements related to integration with Hong\nKong and religious and nationalist disputes in\nTibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater\nrisk in China than in many other countries of\ncurrency fluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate fluctuations and\nhigher rates of inflation as a result of\ninternal social unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries. Unanticipated political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. China's growing\nincome inequality, rapidly aging population\nand significant environmental issues also are\nfactors that may affect the Chinese economy.\nGovernment Control and Regulations. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, government control over certain\nsectors or enterprises and significant\nregulation of investment and industry is still\npervasive, including restrictions on\ninvestment in companies or industries deemed\nto be sensitive to particular national\ninterests, trading of securities of Chinese\nissuers, foreign ownership of Chinese\ncorporations and/or the repatriation of assets\nby foreign investors. Limitations or\nrestrictions on foreign ownership of\nsecurities may have adverse effects on the\nliquidity and performance of the Underlying\nFund and could lead to higher tracking error.\nChinese government intervention in the market\nmay have a negative impact on market\nsentiment, which may in turn affect the\nperformance of the Chinese economy and the\nFund\u2019s investments. Chinese markets generally\ncontinue to experience inefficiency,\nvolatility and pricing anomalies that may be\nconnected to governmental influence, lack of\npublicly available information, and political\nand social instability. Chinese companies,\nsuch as those in the financial services or\ntechnology sectors, and potentially other\nsectors are also subject to the risk that\nChinese authorities can intervene in their\noperations and structure, which may negatively\naffect the value of the Fund's investments.\nEconomic Risk. The Chinese economy may be\nadversely affected by, among other things, a\ndeterioration in global demand for Chinese\nexports or a contraction in spending on\ndomestic goods by Chinese consumers. In\naddition, China may experience substantial\nrates of inflation, significant indebtedness\nor economic recessions, which would have a\nnegative effect on its economy and securities\nmarket. Delays in enterprise restructuring,\nslow development of well-functioning financial\nmarkets and widespread corruption have also\nhindered the performance of the Chinese\neconomy. China continues to receive\nsubstantial pressure from trading partners to\nliberalize official currency exchange rates.\nReduction in spending on Chinese products and\nservices, supply chain diversification,\ninstitution of additional tariffs, sanctions\nor other trade barriers (including as a result\nof heightened trade tensions between China and\nthe U.S. or in response to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any\nof the economies of China\u2019s key trading\npartners may have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy and companies in which the\nFund invests. Certain Chinese companies (which\nmay change from time to time) are directly or\nindirectly subject to economic or trade\nrestrictions imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national security, human\nrights or other concerns of such government.\nFor example, certain foreign technology\ncompanies are subject to U.S. export controls\nas those companies are believed to pose a risk\nto U.S. interests. The U.S. also bans imports\nof goods produced in certain regions of China\nor by certain Chinese companies due to\nconcerns about forced labor. Such restrictions\nmay have unanticipated and adverse effects on\nthe Chinese economy and companies. Any action\nthat targets Chinese financial markets or\nsecurities exchanges could interfere with\norderly trading, delay settlement or cause\nmarket disruptions. The Underlying Index may\ninclude companies that are subject to economic\nor trade restrictions (but not 8 investment\nrestrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments. So long as these restrictions do\nnot include restrictions on investments, the\nFund is generally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the Underlying Index.\nExpropriation Risk. The Chinese government\nmaintains a major role in economic\npolicymaking, and investing in China involves\nrisk of loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and on repatriation of\ncapital invested. Security Risk. China has\nstrained international relations with Taiwan,\nJapan, India, Russia and other neighbors due\nto territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, defense concerns and other\nsecurity concerns. China has a complex\nterritorial dispute regarding the sovereignty\nof Taiwan and has pledged to take control of\nTaiwan, including by force if necessary. The\nChinese military has conducted military drills\naround Taiwan in connection with China\u2019s claim\nto Taiwan. Taiwan-based companies and\nindividuals are significant investors in\nChina. These tensions between Taiwan and China\nmay adversely affect the Chinese economy.\nAdditionally, China is alleged to have\nparticipated in state-sponsored cyberattacks\nagainst foreign companies and foreign\ngovernments. Actual and threatened responses\nto such activity and strained international\nrelations, including purchasing restrictions,\nsanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the\nChinese government or Chinese companies, may\nimpact China\u2019s economy and Chinese issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund invests.\nRelations between China's Han ethnic majority\nand other ethnic groups in China, including\nTibetans and Uighurs, are also strained and\nhave been marked by protests and violence.\nThese situations may cause uncertainty in the\nChinese market and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy. In addition, conflict on the\nKorean Peninsula could adversely affect the\nChinese economy. Such risks, among others, may\nadversely affect the value of a Fund's\ninvestments. Chinese Equity Markets. The\nissuance of B-shares and H-shares by Chinese\ncompanies and the ability to obtain a \u201c back-\ndoor listing \u201d through Red-Chips or P-Chips is\nstill regarded by the Chinese authorities as\nan experiment in economic reform. \u201c Back-door\nlisting \u201d is a means by which a mainland\nChinese company issues Red-Chips or P-Chips to\nobtain quick access to international listing\nand international capital. These share\nmechanisms are subject to the political and\neconomic policies in China. The Fund may also\ninvest in Chinese companies listed on U.S.\nexchanges, such as American Depositary\nReceipts ( \u201c ADRs \u201d ) or variable interest\nentities ( \u201c VIEs \u201d ), which are subject to\nthe investment risks of an associated China-\nbased operating company. Instead of directly\nowning the equity securities of a Chinese\ncompany, a VIE enters into service contracts\nand other contracts with the Chinese company,\nwhich provide the VIE with exposure to the\ncompany. Intervention by the Chinese\ngovernment with respect to VIEs could\nsignificantly affect the Chinese operating\ncompany's performance and the enforceability\nof the VIE's contractual arrangements with the\nChinese company. Hong Kong Political Risk.\nHong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty on\nJuly 1, 1997 as a Special Administrative\nRegion (SAR) of the PRC under the principle of\n\u201c one country, two systems. \u201d Although China\nis obligated to maintain the current\ncapitalist economic and social system of Hong\nKong through June 30, 2047, the continuation\nof economic and social freedoms enjoyed in\nHong Kong is dependent on the government of\nChina. Since 1997, there have been tensions\nbetween the Chinese government and many people\nin Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening\nof control over Hong Kong\u2019s semi-autonomous\nliberal political, economic, legal, and social\nframework. Recent protests and unrest have\nincreased tensions even further. Due to the\ninterconnected nature of the Hong Kong and\nChinese economies, this instability in Hong\nKong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong\nand Chinese markets. In addition, the Hong\nKong dollar trades at a fixed exchange rate in\nrelation to (or, is \u201c pegged \u201d to) the U.S.\ndollar, which has contributed to the growth\nand stability of the Hong Kong economy.\nHowever, it is uncertain how long the currency\npeg will continue or what effect the\nestablishment of an alternative exchange rate\nsystem would have on the Hong Kong economy.\nBecause the Fund's NAV is denominated in U.S.\ndollars, the establishment of an alternative\nexchange rate system could result in a decline\nin the Fund's NAV. Limited Information and\nLegal Remedies . Chinese companies, including\nChinese companies that are listed on U.S.\nexchanges, are not subject to the same degree\nof regulatory requirements, accounting\nstandards or auditor oversight as companies in\nmore developed countries. As a result,\ninformation about the Chinese securities in\nwhich the Fund invests may be less reliable or\ncomplete. Chinese companies with securities\nlisted on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if\nthey do not meet U.S. accounting standards and\nauditor oversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund is not\nactively managed and does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. Risk of Investing in Russia.\nInvesting in Russian securities involves\nsignificant risks, in addition to those\ndescribed under \u201c Risk of Investing in\nEmerging Markets \u201d and \u201c Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk, \u201d that are not typically associated with\ninvesting in U.S. securities, including: \u25a0 The\nrisk of delays in settling portfolio\ntransactions and the risk of loss arising out\nof the system of share registration and\ncustody used in Russia; \u25a0 Risks in connection\nwith the maintenance of the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s portfolio securities and\ncash with foreign sub-custodians and\nsecurities depositories, including the risk\nthat appropriate sub-custody arrangements will\nnot be available to the Fund or an Underlying\nFund; \u25a0 The risk that the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s ownership rights in\nportfolio securities could be lost through\nfraud or negligence because ownership in\nshares of Russian companies is recorded by the\ncompanies themselves and by registrars, rather\nthan by a central registration system; 9 \u25a0 The\nrisk that the Fund or an Underlying Fund may\nnot be able to pursue claims on behalf of its\nshareholders because of the system of share\nregistration and custody, and because Russian\nbanking institutions and registrars are not\nguaranteed by the Russian government; and \u25a0\nThe risk that various responses by other\nnation-states to alleged Russian cyber\nactivity will impact Russia\u2019s economy and\nRussian issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. Russian invasion of Ukraine .\nRussia launched a large-scale invasion of\nUkraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and\nduration of the military action, resulting\nsanctions and resulting future market\ndisruptions, including declines in its stock\nmarkets and the value of the ruble against the\nU.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but\ncould be significant. Disruptions caused by\nRussian military action or other actions\n(including cyberattacks and espionage) or\nresulting actual and threatened responses to\nsuch activity, including purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts or changes in\nconsumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia\u2019s\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund or the Underlying Funds invest,\nor the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual\nand threatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Russia Sanctions. Governments in the\nU.S. and many other countries (collectively,\nthe \u201c Sanctioning Bodies \u201d ) have imposed\neconomic sanctions on certain Russian\nindividuals, including politicians, and\nRussian corporate and banking entities,\nincluding banning Russia from global payments\nsystems that facilitate cross-border payments.\nThe Sanctioning Bodies, or others, could also\ninstitute broader sanctions on Russia. These\nsanctions, or even the threat of further\nsanctions, may result in the decline of the\nvalue and liquidity of Russian securities, a\nweakening of the ruble or other adverse\nconsequences to the Russian economy. These\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Russian securities and/or funds\ninvested in prohibited assets, impairing the\nability of the Fund or Underlying Fund to buy,\nsell, receive or deliver those securities\nand/or assets. The sanctions against certain\nRussian issuers include prohibitions on\ntransacting in or dealing in issuances of debt\nor equity of such issuers. Compliance with\neach of these sanctions has and may continue\nto impair the ability of the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive or\ndeliver the affected securities or other\nsecurities of such issuers. If it becomes\nimpracticable or unlawful for the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund to hold securities subject to,\nor otherwise affected by, sanctions\n(collectively, \u201c affected securities \u201d ), or\nif deemed appropriate by BFA, the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits\nof the affected securities in connection with\ncreation transactions and instead require a\ncash deposit, which may also increase an\nUnderlying Fund's transaction costs. An\nUnderlying Fund may also be legally required\nto freeze assets in a blocked account.\nSanctions have resulted in Russia taking\ncounter measures or retaliatory actions, which\nhas impaired the value and liquidity of\nRussian securities. These retaliatory measures\ninclude the immediate freeze of Russian assets\nheld by the Fund's or an Underlying Fund. Due\nto the freeze of any Underlying Fund assets,\nincluding depositary receipts, the Fund's or\nan Underlying Fund may need to liquidate non-\nrestricted assets in order to satisfy any Fund\nredemption orders. The liquidation of\nUnderlying Fund assets during this time may\nalso result in the Fund's or an Underlying\nFund receiving substantially lower prices for\nits securities. Russia may implement\nadditional retaliatory measures, which may\nfurther impair the value and liquidity of\nRussian securities and the ability of the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund to receive dividend\npayments. Recently, Russia has issued a number\nof countersanctions, some of which restrict\nthe distribution of profits by limited\nliability companies ( e.g. , dividends), and\nprohibits Russian persons from entering into\ntransactions with designated persons from \u201c\nunfriendly states \u201d as well as the export of\nraw materials or other products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons. Russian companies\nmay be unable to pay dividends and, if they\npay dividends, the Fund may be unable to\nreceive them. These sanctions, the decision by\nRussia to suspend trading on the Moscow\nExchange (MOEX) and prohibit non-resident\ninvestors from executing security sales, and\nother events have led to changes in certain of\nthe Underlying Indexes of the Underlying\nFunds. The Underlying Fund\u2019s Index Providers\nhave removed Russian securities where present\nin an Underlying Index of an Underlying Fund.\nTo the extent that the Fund or an Underlying\nFund rebalances its portfolio and trades in\nnon-Russian securities to seek to track the\ninvestment results of its Underlying Index,\nthis may result in transaction costs and\nincreased tracking error. The Underlying Funds\nare currently restricted from trading in\nRussian securities, including those in their\nportfolios, while an Underlying Fund's\nUnderlying Index has removed Russian\nsecurities. For Underlying Funds with Russian\nsecurities, this disparity will also lead to\nincreased tracking error. The inability of the\nUnderlying Fund to trade in Russian securities\nmay adversely affect the Underlying Fund\u2019s\nability to meet its investment objective. It\nis unknown when, or if, sanctions may be\nlifted or the Underlying Fund\u2019s ability to\ntrade in Russian securities will resume. Also,\nif an affected security is included in an\nUnderlying Fund's Underlying Index, the\nUnderlying Fund may, where practicable, seek\nto eliminate its holdings of the affected\nsecurity by employing or augmenting its\nrepresentative sampling strategy to seek to\ntrack the investment results of its Underlying\nIndex. The use of (or increased use of) a\nrepresentative sampling strategy may increase\nthe Underlying Fund\u2019s tracking error risk. If\nthe affected securities constitute a\nsignificant percentage of an Underlying Fund's\nUnderlying Index, the Underlying Fund may not\nbe able to effectively implement a\nrepresentative sampling strategy, which may\nresult in significant tracking error between\nthe Underlying Fund\u2019s performance and the\nperformance of its Underlying Index. Risk of\nInvesting in Saudi Arabia. The ability of\nforeign investors (such as the Fund and\nUnderlying Fund) to invest in the securities\nof Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new.\nSuch ability could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership in such securities. In\naddition, the Saudi Arabian government places\ninvestment limitations on the ownership of\nSaudi Arabian issuers by foreign investors,\nincluding a limitation on the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's 10 ownership of any single\nissuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock\nExchange, which may prevent the Fund from\ninvesting in accordance with its strategy and\ncontribute to tracking error against the\nUnderlying Index. Saudi Arabia is highly\nreliant on income from the sale of petroleum\nand trade with other countries involved in the\nsale of petroleum, and its economy is\ntherefore vulnerable to changes in foreign\ncurrency values and the market for petroleum.\nAs global demand for petroleum fluctuates,\nSaudi Arabia may be significantly impacted.\nLike most Middle Eastern governments, the\ngovernment of Saudi Arabia exercises\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector. Although liberalization in the\nwider economy is underway, in many areas it\nhas lagged significantly: restrictions on\nforeign ownership persist, and the government\nhas an ownership stake in many key industries.\nThe situation is exacerbated by the fact that\nSaudi Arabia is governed by an absolute\nmonarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Governmental actions in the future\ncould have a significant effect on economic\nconditions in Saudi Arabia, which could affect\nprivate sector companies and the Fund (or an\nUnderlying Fund), as well as the value of\nsecurities in the Fund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's\nportfolio. Any economic sanctions on Saudi\nArabian individuals or Saudi Arabian corporate\nentities, or even the threat of sanctions, may\nresult in the decline of the value and\nliquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a\nweakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse\nconsequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. In\naddition, Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy relies\nheavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes\nin the availability of this labor supply could\nhave an adverse effect on the economy.\nInvestments in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers involve risks not typically associated\nwith investments in securities of issuers in\nmore developed countries that may negatively\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s or Underlying\nFund's investments. Such heightened risks may\ninclude, among others, expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets, restrictions on and\ngovernment intervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision\nmaking, armed conflict, crime and instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Although the political\nsituation in Saudi Arabia is largely stable,\nSaudi Arabia has historically experienced\npolitical instability, and there remains the\npossibility that instability in the larger\nMiddle East region could adversely impact the\neconomy of Saudi Arabia. Political instability\nin the larger Middle East region has caused\nsignificant disruptions to many industries.\nContinued political and social unrest in these\nareas may negatively affect the value of\nsecurities in the Fund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's\nportfolio. Saudi Arabia Broker Risk. There are\na number of different ways of conducting\ntransactions in equity securities in the Saudi\nArabian market. A Fund (or an Underlying Fund)\ngenerally expects to conduct its transactions\nin a manner in which a Fund (or an Underlying\nFund) would not be limited by Saudi Arabian\nregulations to a single broker. However, there\nmay be a limited number of brokers who can\nprovide services to a Fund, which may have an\nadverse impact on the prices, quantity or\ntiming of Fund transactions. The limited\nnumber of brokers may impact a Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s ability to achieve best\nexecution on securities transactions. In\naddition, the limited number of brokers\navailable to a Fund (or an Underlying Fund)\nmay make a Fund (or an Underlying Fund) more\nsusceptible to credit loss or trading\ndisruptions in the event of a default or\nbusiness disruption by one or more of the\navailable brokers. Should a Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s ability to use one or more\nbrokers be affected for any reason, this could\ndisrupt the operations of a Fund and affect\nthe ability of a Fund to track its Underlying\nIndex and/or cause a Fund\u2019s shares to trade at\na premium or discount to NAV. A Fund may also\nincur losses due to the acts or omissions of\nits brokers in the execution or settlement of\nany transaction or in the transfer of any\nfunds or securities. Risk of Investing in the\nU.S. A decrease in imports or exports, changes\nin trade regulations, inflation and/or an\neconomic recession in the U.S. may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the U.S. economy\nand the securities listed on U.S. exchanges.\nProposed and adopted policy and legislative\nchanges in the U.S. are changing many aspects\nof financial, commercial, public health,\nenvironmental, and other regulation and may\nhave a significant effect on U.S. markets\ngenerally, as well as on the value of certain\nsecurities. Governmental agencies project that\nthe U.S. will continue to maintain elevated\npublic debt levels for the foreseeable future.\nAlthough elevated debt levels do not\nnecessarily indicate or cause economic\nproblems, elevated public debt service costs\nmay constrain future economic growth.\nCircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal on\nU.S. government debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. If U.S. relations\nwith certain countries deteriorate, it could\nadversely affect U.S. issuers as well as\nnon-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for\ntrade. The U.S. has also experienced increased\ninternal unrest and discord. If these trends\nwere to continue, it may have an adverse\nimpact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in\nwhich the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests.\nSavings Associations Risk. Federally- and\nstate-chartered savings associations, such as\nsavings and loans and other \u201c thrift \u201d\ninstitutions, provide banking services,\nincluding mortgage lending, and operate under\nthe supervisory authority of the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency. These\nassociations are subject to extensive\nregulation affecting the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge, and\nthe amount of capital they must maintain. This\nregulation can have the effect of limiting the\nprofitability of these associations, and their\nprofitability may change frequently. Savings\nassociations may be adversely affected by\nincreases in interest rates and loan losses,\ndecreases in the availability of money or\nasset valuations and adverse conditions in\nother related markets. The historically low\ninterest rate environment has created certain\nrisks to savings associations as they continue\nto re-evaluate their business models and risk\nappetites to generate returns. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund or an Underlying Fund\nmay engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. The Fund or an Underlying Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a decline in the\nvalue of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund or an Underlying\nFund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company,\nN.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d ), the Fund's securities\nlending agent, will take into account the tax\nimpact to shareholders of substitute payments\nfor dividends when managing the Fund's\nsecurities lending program. 11 Small-\nCapitalization Companies Risk. Stock prices of\nsmall-capitalization companies may be more\nvolatile than those of larger companies and,\ntherefore, the share price of an Underlying\nFund that invests mostly in small-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile\nthan those of funds that invest a larger\npercentage of their assets in stocks issued by\nmid- or large-capitalization companies. Stock\nprices of small-capitalization companies are\ngenerally more vulnerable than those of mid-\nor large-capitalization companies to adverse\nbusiness and economic developments. Securities\nof small-capitalization companies may be\nthinly traded, making it difficult for the\nUnderlying Fund to buy and sell them. In\naddition, small-capitalization companies are\ntypically less financially stable than larger,\nmore established companies and may depend on a\nsmall number of essential personnel, making\nthese companies more vulnerable to\nexperiencing adverse effects due to the loss\nof personnel. Small-capitalization companies\nalso normally have less diverse product lines\nthan those of mid- or large-capitalization\ncompanies and are more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments concerning their products.\nSovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations\nRisk. An investment in sovereign debt\nobligations involves special risks not present\nin corporate debt obligations. Sovereign debt\nincludes securities issued by or guaranteed by\na foreign sovereign government. The issuer of\nthe sovereign debt that controls the repayment\nof the debt may be unable or unwilling to\nrepay principal or interest when due, and the\nFund or the Underlying Funds may have limited\nrecourse in the event of a default. Similar to\nother issuers, changes to the financial\ncondition or credit rating of a government may\ncause the value of a sovereign debt obligation\nto decline. During periods of economic\nuncertainty, the market prices of sovereign\ndebt may be more volatile than prices of U.S.\nTreasury debt obligations and may affect the\nFund's or Underlying Fund's NAV. In the past,\ncertain emerging market countries have\nencountered difficulties in servicing their\ndebt obligations, withheld payments of\nprincipal and interest and declared moratoria\non the payment of principal and interest on\ntheir sovereign debts. Several countries in\nwhich the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests\nhave defaulted on their sovereign debt\nobligations in the past or encountered\ndowngrades of their sovereign debt\nobligations, and those countries (or other\ncountries) may default or risk further\ndowngrades in the future. Tax Risk. Because\nthe Fund is expected to invest in the\nUnderlying Funds, the Fund\u2019s realized losses\non sales of shares of an Underlying Fund may\nbe indefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c\nwash sales. \u201d Distributions of short-term\ncapital gains by an Underlying Fund will be\nrecognized as ordinary income by the Fund and\nwould not be offset by the Fund\u2019s capital loss\ncarryforwards, if any. Capital loss\ncarryforwards of an Underlying Fund, if any,\nwould not offset net capital gains of the\nFund. Tracking Error Risk. The Fund or each of\nits Underlying Funds may be subject to \u201c\ntracking error, \u201d which is the divergence of a\nfund\u2019s performance from that of its underlying\nindex. Tracking error may occur because of\ndifferences between the securities and other\ninstruments held in a fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in the Fund's Underlying Index\nor an Underlying Fund's underlying index,\npricing differences (including, as applicable,\ndifferences between a security\u2019s price at the\nlocal market close and the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's valuation of a security at\nthe time of calculation of the Fund's or\nUnderlying Fund's NAV, respectively),\ntransaction costs incurred by the Fund or its\nUnderlying Funds, the Fund\u2019s or its Underlying\nFunds' holding of uninvested cash, differences\nin timing of the accrual or the valuation of\ndividends or interest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s shareholders, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions carried out\nto minimize the distribution of capital gains\nto shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the Underlying Index or an\nUnderlying Fund's underlying index or the\ncosts to the Fund or an Underlying Fund of\ncomplying with various new or existing\nregulatory requirements, among other reasons.\nThis risk may be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Tracking error also may\nresult because a fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while such a fund's underlying index\ndoes not. U.S. Agency Debt Risk. Unsecured\nbonds or debentures issued by the U.S.\ngovernment or one of its agencies or sponsored\nentities help finance U.S. governmental\npolicies and public missions, but may be\nbacked only by the general creditworthiness\nand reputation of the U.S. government agency\nor government sponsored entity and not the\nfull faith and credit of the U.S. government.\nFor example, debt issued by Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks,\nprovides financing, credit, and/or liquidity\nto the housing and mortgage markets, and is\nnot backed by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. government. In addition, debt issued by\nthe Tennessee Valley Authority, which provides\nelectricity generation and flood control in\nparts of the Southeast region of the U.S., and\nthe Federal Farm Credit Banks, which provide\ncredit and related services to the\nagricultural sector, is not backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. government.\nGinnie Mae securities and certain foreign\ngovernment debt issuances guaranteed by the\nU.S. government, including certain issuances\nby Iraq and Israel, are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. government. Bonds\nor debentures that do not carry the backing of\nthe full faith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment are subject to more credit risk\nthan securities that are supported by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. government. If a\nU.S. government agency or sponsored entity\nthat is the issuer of securities in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests is unable to meet its\nobligations or ceases to exist and no plan is\nmade for repayment of securities, the\nperformance of an Underlying Fund will be\nadversely affected. There can be no assurance\nthat the U.S. government would provide\nfinancial support to any of these U.S.\ngovernmental agencies or sponsored entities if\nit is not obligated to do so. In 2008, Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac were placed under the\nconservatorship of the U.S. government, which\nprovided financial support to the U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored entities. However, there\ncan be no assurance that such past U.S.\ngovernment support will result in support in\nthe future. Any actual or potential disruption\nto a U.S. government agency or sponsored\nentity, or the financial condition or credit\nof the U.S. government, could cause the value\nof U.S. agency debt to decline. U.S. Agency\nMortgage-Backed Securities Risk. Securities\nbacked by pools of mortgages issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government or one of\nits agencies or sponsored entities, including\nthe Government National Mortgage Association (\n\u201c Ginnie Mae \u201d ), the Federal National\nMortgage Association ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d ) and\nthe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( \u201c\nFreddie Mac \u201d ). While securities guaranteed\nby Ginnie Mae are backed by the full faith and\ncredit of the U.S. government, securities\nissued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not\nbacked by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. government, and there can be no assurance\nthat the U.S. government would provide\nfinancial support 12 to its agencies or\nsponsored entities where it is not obligated\nto do so. Bonds or debentures that do not\ncarry the backing of the full faith and credit\nof the U.S. government are subject to more\ncredit risk than securities that are supported\nby the full faith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment. To the extent that the U.S.\ngovernment has provided support to a U.S.\nagency or sponsored entity in the past, there\ncan be no assurance that the U.S. government\nwill provide support in the future if it is\nnot obligated to do so. If a U.S. government\nagency or sponsored entity that is the issuer\nof securities in which an Underlying Fund\ninvests is unable to meet its obligations or\nceases to exist and no plan is made for\nrepayment of securities, the performance of an\nUnderlying Fund will be adversely affected.\nMortgage-backed securities ( \u201c MBS \u201d )\nrepresent interests in \u201c pools \u201d of mortgages\nand, due to the nature of these loans they\nrepresent, are subject to prepayment and\nextension risk. Prepayment risk is the risk\nthat, during periods of falling interest\nrates, an issuer of mortgages and other fixed-\nincome securities may be able to repay\nprincipal prior to the security\u2019s maturity.\nThis may cause an Underlying Fund to have to\nreinvest in securities with a lower yield or\nhigher risk of default, resulting in a decline\nin an Underlying Fund's income or return\npotential. MBS are also subject to extension\nrisk, which is the risk that when interest\nrates rise, certain MBS will be paid off\nsubstantially more slowly than originally\nanticipated and the value of those securities\nmay fall sharply, resulting in a decline in\nincome and potentially in the value of the\ninvestment. Because of prepayment and\nextension risks, MBS react differently to\nchanges in interest rates than other bonds.\nSmall movements in interest rates (both\nincreases and decreases) may quickly and\nsignificantly reduce the value of certain MBS.\nThese securities are also subject to the risk\nof default on the underlying mortgage loans,\nparticularly during periods of economic\ndownturn. Certain Underlying Funds seek to\nobtain exposure to the fixed-rate portion of\nU.S. agency mortgage pass-through securities\nprimarily through to-be-announced ( \u201c TBA \u201d )\nsecurities, or TBA transactions. TBAs refer to\na commonly used mechanism for the forward\nsettlement of U.S. agency MBS, and not to a\nseparate type of MBS. Default or bankruptcy of\na counterparty to a TBA transaction would\nexpose the Fund, through its investments in\nsuch an Underlying Fund, to possible losses\nbecause of adverse market action, expenses or\ndelays in connection with the purchase or sale\nof the pools of mortgage pass-through\nsecurities specified in the TBA transaction.\nCertain Underlying Funds intend to invest cash\npending settlement of TBA transactions in\nmoney market instruments, repurchase\nagreements, or other high quality, liquid\nshort-term instruments, including money market\nfunds advised by BFA. Such Underlying Funds\nwill pay their pro rata share of fees and\nexpenses of any money market fund that it may\ninvest in, in addition to the Underlying\nFund\u2019s own fees and expenses. U.S. Government\nIssuers Risk. Obligations of U.S. government\nagencies and authorities are supported by\nvarying degrees of credit but generally are\nnot backed by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. government. Bonds or debentures that do\nnot carry the backing of the full faith and\ncredit of the U.S. government are subject to\nmore credit risk than securities that are\nsupported by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. government. To the extent that the U.S.\ngovernment has provided support to a U.S.\nagency or sponsored entity in the past, there\ncan be no assurance that the U.S. government\nwill provide support in the future if it is\nnot obligated to do so. If a U.S. government\nagency or sponsored entity that is the issuer\nof securities in which the Fund invests is\nunable to meet its obligations or ceases to\nexist and no plan is made for repayment of\nsecurities, the performance of the Fund will\nbe adversely affected. Similar to other\nissuers, changes to the financial condition or\ncredit rating of the U.S. government or U.S.\ngovernment agencies and authorities may cause\nthe value of the Fund's investments to\ndecline. U.S. Treasury securities are rated\nAA+ by S&P Global Ratings. A downgrade of the\nrating of U.S. Treasury securities may cause\nthe value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Because U.S.\ngovernment debt obligations are often used as\na benchmark for other borrowing arrangements,\na downgrade could also result in higher\ninterest rates for a range of borrowers, cause\ndisruptions in the international bond markets\nand have a substantial adverse effect on the\nU.S. and global economy. A high national debt\nlevel may increase market pressures to meet\ngovernment funding needs, which may drive debt\ncost higher and lead the government to issue\nadditional debt, thereby increasing\nrefinancing risk. A high national debt also\nraises concerns that the U.S. government will\nnot be able to make principal or interest\npayments when they are due. If market\nparticipants determine that U.S. sovereign\ndebt levels have become unsustainable, the\nvalue of the U.S. dollar could decline, thus\nincreasing inflationary pressures,\nparticularly with respect to services\noutsourced to non-U.S. providers and imported\ngoods, and constrain or prevent the U.S.\ngovernment from implementing effective\ncountercyclical fiscal policy in economic\ndownturns. Direct obligations of the U.S.\nTreasury have historically involved little\nrisk of loss of principal if held to maturity.\nHowever, due to fluctuations in interest\nrates, the market value of such securities may\nvary during the period that shareholders own\nshares of the Fund. Notwithstanding that U.S.\nTreasury obligations are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the United States,\ncircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal,\nsuch as reaching the legislative \u201c debt\nceiling. \u201d Such non-payment would result in\nlosses to the Fund and substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. Valuation Risk. The\nprice the Fund or an Underlying Fund could\nreceive upon the sale of a security or other\nasset may differ from the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's valuation of the security or\nother asset and from the value used by its\nunderlying index, particularly for securities\nor other assets that trade in low volume or\nvolatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair value methodology as a result of trade\nsuspensions or for other reasons. Because\nnon-U.S. exchanges may be open on days or\nduring time periods when the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund does not price its shares, the\nvalue of the securities or other assets in the\nFund or an Underlying Fund's portfolio may\nchange on days or during time periods when the\nFund will not be able to purchase or sell the\nFund or an Underlying Fund\u2019s shares. In\naddition, for purposes of calculating the\nFund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in\nnon-U.S. currencies is translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. This\ntranslation may result in a difference between\nthe prices used to calculate the Fund's NAV\nand the prices used by its underlying index,\nwhich, in turn, could result in a difference\nbetween the Fund's performance and the\nperformance of its underlying index.\nAuthorized Participants 13 who purchase or\nredeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is\nholding fair-valued securities may receive\nfewer or more shares, or lower or higher\nredemption proceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities not been fair\nvalued or been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological issues or\nerrors by pricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. A Further Discussion\nof Other Risks The Fund may also be subject to\ncertain other risks associated with its\ninvestments and investment strategies. The\norder of the below risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any particular\nrisk factor. Asian Economic Risk. Certain\nAsian economies have experienced rapid growth\nand industrialization in recent years, but\nthere is no assurance that this growth rate\nwill be maintained. Other Asian economies,\nhowever, have experienced high inflation, high\nunemployment, currency devaluations and\nrestrictions, and over-extension of credit.\nGeopolitical hostility, political instability,\nand economic or environmental events in any\none Asian country may have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire Asian region, as\nwell as on major trading partners outside\nAsia. Any adverse event in the Asian markets\nmay have a significant adverse effect on some\nor all of the economies of the countries in\nwhich the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests.\nIn particular, China is a key trading partner\nof many Asian countries and any changes in\ntrading relationships between China and other\nAsian countries may affect the region as a\nwhole. Many Asian countries are subject to\npolitical risk, including political\ninstability, corruption and regional conflict\nwith neighboring countries. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S. or with China, and if these relations\nwere to worsen, they could adversely affect\nAsian issuers that rely on the U.S. or China\nfor trade. In addition, many Asian countries\nare subject to social and labor risks\nassociated with demands for improved\npolitical, economic and social conditions.\nThese risks, among others, may adversely\naffect the value of an Underlying Fund's\ninvestments. Basic Materials Industry Risk.\nIssuers in the basic materials industry may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, import\ncontrols and increased competition. Production\nof industrial materials often exceeds demand\nas a result of over-building or economic\ndownturns, leading to poor investment returns.\nIssuers in the basic materials industry are at\nrisk for environmental damage and product\nliability claims and may be adversely affected\nby depletion of resources, delays in technical\nprogress, labor relations and government\nregulations. Central and South American\nEconomic Risk. Certain Central and South\nAmerican countries have experienced high\ninterest rates, economic volatility, high\nlevels of inflation, currency devaluations,\nregime changes, government defaults and high\nunemployment rates. Additionally, commodities\nsuch as oil and gas, minerals and metals\nrepresent a significant percentage of the\nregion\u2019s exports, and the economies of\ncountries in the region are particularly\nsensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices\nas a result. The impact of any of the\nforegoing events in one country could have a\nsignificant effect on the entire region.\nClose-Out Risk for Qualified Financial\nContracts. Regulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require counterparties\nthat are part of U.S. or foreign global\nsystemically important banking organizations\nto include contractual restrictions on close-\nout and cross-default in agreements relating\nto qualified financial contracts. Qualified\nfinancial contracts include agreements\nrelating to swaps, currency forwards and other\nderivatives as well as repurchase agreements\nand securities lending agreements. The\nrestrictions prevent the Fund from closing out\na qualified financial contract during a\nspecified time period if the counterparty is\nsubject to resolution proceedings and also\nprohibit the Fund from exercising default\nrights due to a receivership or similar\nproceeding of an affiliate of the\ncounterparty. These requirements may increase\ncredit risk and other risks to the Fund.\nCommodity Risk. Companies whose performance is\nreflected in the Fund\u2019s portfolio or\nUnderlying Index may be adversely affected by\nchanges or trends in commodity prices.\nCommodity prices may be influenced or\ncharacterized by unpredictable factors,\nincluding, where applicable, high volatility,\nchanges in supply and demand relationships,\nweather, agriculture, trade, pestilence,\npolitical instability, war, catastrophic\nevents, changes in interest rates and monetary\nand other governmental policies, action and\ninaction, including price changes due to trade\nrelations. Securities of companies held by the\nFund that are dependent on a single commodity,\nor are concentrated in a single commodity\nsector, may typically exhibit even higher\nvolatility attributable to commodity prices.\nConsumer Discretionary Sector Risk. The\nsuccess of consumer product manufacturers and\nretailers is tied closely to the performance\nof domestic and international economies,\ninterest rates, exchange rates, supply chains,\ncompetition, consumer confidence, changes in\ndemographics and consumer preferences.\nCompanies in the consumer discretionary sector\ndepend heavily on disposable household income\nand consumer spending, and may be strongly\naffected by social trends and marketing\ncampaigns. These companies may be subject to\nsevere competition, which may have an adverse\nimpact on their profitability. Custody Risk.\nCustody risk refers to the risks inherent in\nthe process of clearing and settling trades,\nas well as the holding of securities by local\nbanks, agents and depositories. Low trading\nvolumes and volatile prices in less developed\nmarkets may make trades harder to complete and\nsettle, and governments or trade groups may\ncompel local agents to hold securities in\ndesignated depositories that may not be\nsubject to independent evaluation. Local\nagents are held only to the standards of care\nof their local markets. In general, the less\ndeveloped a country\u2019s securities markets are,\nthe higher the degree of custody risk. 14\nEastern European Economic Risk. An investment\nin issuers located or operating in Eastern\nEurope may subject the Fund or Underlying Fund\nto legal, regulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity and economic risks specific to\nEastern Europe. Economies of certain Eastern\nEuropean countries rely heavily on the export\nof commodities, including oil, gas, and\ncertain metals. As a result, such economies\nmay be impacted by international commodity\nprices and are particularly vulnerable to\nglobal demand for these products. Geopolitical\nevents including armed conflict or war, acts\nof terrorism, and other instability in certain\nEastern European countries may cause\nuncertainty in their financial markets and\nadversely affect the performance of the\nissuers to which the Fund or an Underlying\nFund have exposure. The securities markets in\nsome Eastern European countries are\nsubstantially smaller and less developed, with\nless government supervision and regulation of\nstock exchanges, and may be less liquid and\nmore volatile than securities markets in the\nU.S. or Western European countries. In\naddition, investing in securities of issuers\nlocated or operating in Eastern Europe may\ninvolve: \u25a0 The risk of delays in settling\nportfolio transactions and the risk of loss\narising out of the system of share\nregistration and custody used in certain\nEastern European countries; \u25a0 Risks in\nconnection with the maintenance of the Fund's\nor Underlying Fund's portfolio securities and\ncash with foreign sub-custodians and\nsecurities depositories, including the risk\nthat appropriate sub-custody arrangements will\nnot be available to the Fund or Underlying\nFund; \u25a0 The risk that the Fund's or Underlying\nFund's ownership rights in portfolio\nsecurities could be lost through fraud or\nnegligence as a result of the fact that\nownership in shares of certain Eastern\nEuropean companies is recorded by the\ncompanies themselves and by registrars, rather\nthan a central registration system; \u25a0 The risk\nthat the Fund or Underlying Fund may not be\nable to pursue claims on behalf of its\nshareholders because of the system of share\nregistration and custody, and because certain\nEastern European banking institutions and\nregistrars are not guaranteed by their\nrespective governments; and \u25a0 Risks in\nconnection with Eastern European countries'\ndependence on the economic health of Western\nEuropean countries and the EU as a whole.\nOther risks related to investing in securities\nof issuers located or operating in Eastern\nEurope include: the potential absence of legal\nstructures governing private and foreign\ninvestments and private property; the\npossibility of the loss of all or a\nsubstantial portion of the Fund\u2019s or\nUnderlying Fund's assets invested in issuers\nlocated or operating in Eastern Europe as a\nresult of expropriation; and certain national\npolicies which may restrict the Fund\u2019s or\nUnderlying Fund's investment opportunities,\nincluding, without limitation, restrictions on\ninvesting in issuers or industries deemed\nsensitive to relevant national interests. In\naddition, Eastern European securities markets\nare particularly sensitive to social,\npolitical, economic, and currency events that\ninvolve Russia and may suffer heavy losses as\na result of their trading and investment links\nto the Russian economy and currency or its\nneighbors. Russian Invasion of Ukraine .\nRussia launched a large-scale invasion of\nUkraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and\nduration of the military action, resulting\nsanctions and resulting future market\ndisruptions, including declines in its stock\nmarkets and the value of the ruble against the\nU.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but\ncould be significant. Disruptions caused by\nRussian military action or other actions\n(including cyberattacks and espionage) or\nresulting actual and threatened responses to\nsuch activity, including purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts or changes in\nconsumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally.\nEnergy Sector Risk. The market value of\nsecurities issued by companies in the energy\nsector may decline for the following reasons,\namong others: changes in and volatility of\nglobal energy prices, energy supply and\ndemand, and spending on exploration and\nproduction of energy sources; exchange rates,\ninterest rates, economic conditions, and tax\ntreatment; changes in the actual or perceived\navailability of oil or other resource\ndeposits; the enactment or cessation of trade\nsanctions or import controls; war or other\ngeopolitical conflicts; negative perception;\nincreased litigation; energy conservation\nefforts; energy infrastructure developments or\nservice failures; and increased competition\nand technological advances. Companies in this\nsector may be subject to substantial\ngovernment regulation and contractual fixed\npricing, which may increase the cost of doing\nbusiness and limit the earnings of these\ncompanies. A significant portion of the\nrevenues of these companies may depend on a\nrelatively small number of customers,\nincluding governmental entities and utilities.\nAs a result, governmental budget constraints\nmay have a material adverse effect on the\nstock prices of companies in this sector.\nEnergy companies may also operate in, or\nengage in transactions involving, countries\nthat have less developed regulatory regimes or\na history of expropriation, confiscation of\nassets, foreign investment restrictions,\nnationalization or other adverse policies or\nthat are at greater risk of political and\nsocial unrest, coups or labor disruptions.\nEnergy companies also face a significant risk\nof liability from accidents resulting in\ninjury or loss of life or property, pollution\nor other environmental problems, equipment\nmalfunctions or mishandling of materials and a\nrisk of loss from terrorism, cyber incident,\npolitical strife or natural disasters. Any\nsuch event could have serious consequences for\nthe general population of the affected area\nand could have an adverse impact on the Fund\u2019s\nor an Underlying Fund's portfolio and the\nperformance of the Fund. Energy companies may\nhave relatively high levels of debt and may be\nmore likely than other companies to\nrestructure their businesses if there are\ndownturns in energy markets or in the global\neconomy. Energy production companies,\nespecially those for oil and gas, may also\nhave to contend with service disruptions,\npipeline and equipment leaks and ruptures,\nexplosions, fires, unscheduled downtime,\ntransportation interruptions, discharges or\nreleases of toxic or hazardous gases and other\nenvironmental risks. 15 The energy sector may\nexperience significant market volatility. For\nexample, Russia\u2019s large-scale invasion of\nUkraine on February 24, 2022 led to\ndisruptions and increased volatility in the\nenergy and commodity futures markets due to\nactual and potential disruptions in the supply\nand demand for certain commodities, including\noil and natural gas. The U.S. and other actors\nhave, in response, enacted various sanctions\nand restrictions on business dealings with\nRussia, which include restrictions on imports\nof oil, natural gas and coal. The effect of\nthe current sanctions and restrictions, as\nwell as the extent and duration of the Russian\nmilitary action, additional sanctions and\nassociated market disruptions on the energy\nsector, are impossible to predict and depend\non a number of factors. The effect of these\nevents or any related developments could be\nsignificant and may have a severe adverse\neffect on the performance of the Fund.\nEuropean Economic Risk. The Economic and\nMonetary Union (the \u201c eurozone \u201d ) of the EU\nrequires compliance by member states that are\nmembers of the eurozone with restrictions on\ninflation rates, deficits, interest rates and\ndebt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary\ncontrols, each of which may significantly\naffect every country in Europe, including\nthose countries that are not members of the\neurozone. Additionally, European countries\noutside of the eurozone may present economic\nrisks that are independent of the indirect\neffects that eurozone policies have on them.\nIn particular, the United Kingdom's (the \u201c\nU.K. \u201d ) economy may be affected by global\neconomic, industrial and financial shifts.\nChanges in imports or exports, changes in\ngovernmental or EU regulations on trade,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro (the\ncommon currency of eurozone countries), the\ndefault or threat of default by an EU member\nstate on its sovereign debt and/or an economic\nrecession in an EU member state may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on the economies of\nother EU member states and their trading\npartners. The European financial markets have\nhistorically experienced volatility and\nadverse trends due to concerns about economic\ndownturns or government debt levels in several\nEuropean countries, including, but not limited\nto, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.\nThese events have affected and may in the\nfuture adversely affect the exchange rate of\nthe euro and may significantly affect European\ncountries. Responses to financial problems by\nEuropean governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the desired results,\nmay result in social unrest, may limit future\ngrowth and economic recovery or may have other\nunintended consequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and other\nentities of their debt could have additional\nadverse effects on economies, financial\nmarkets and asset valuations around the world.\nIn addition, one or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K.\nleft the EU ( \u201c Brexit \u201d ) on January 31,\n2020. Brexit could adversely affect European\nor worldwide political, regulatory, economic\nor market conditions and could contribute to\ninstability in global political institutions,\nregulatory agencies and financial markets. The\nnational politics of countries in Europe have\nbeen unpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding, for example, secessionist\nmovements. The governments of European\ncountries may be subject to change and such\ncountries may experience social and political\nunrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or\nsocial developments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region could also impact financial\nmarkets. The impact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of the Fund's investments.\nRussian Invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally.\nExtension Risk. During periods of rising\ninterest rates, certain debt obligations may\nbe paid off substantially more slowly than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply, resulting in a\ndecline in the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\nincome and potentially in the value of the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's investments.\nFixed-to-Floating Rate Securities Risk. Fixed-\nto-floating rate securities have an initial\nterm with a fixed dividend or coupon rate and\nfollowing this initial term bear a floating\nrate. Securities which include a floating or\nvariable interest rate component can be less\nsensitive to interest rate changes than\nsecurities with fixed interest rates, but may\ndecline in value if their interest rates do\nnot rise as much, or as quickly, as interest\nrates in general. Conversely, floating rate\nsecurities will not generally increase in\nvalue if interest rates decline. A decline in\ninterest rates may result in a reduction in\nincome received from floating rate securities\nheld by an Underlying Fund and may adversely\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s shares.\nGenerally, floating rate securities carry\nlower yields than similar fixed rate\nsecurities. The interest rate for a floating\nrate security resets or adjusts periodically\nby reference to a benchmark interest rate. The\nimpact of interest rate changes on floating\nrate investments is typically mitigated by the\nperiodic interest rate reset of the\ninvestments. Fixed-to-floating rate securities\ngenerally are subject to legal or contractual\nrestrictions on resale, may trade\ninfrequently, and their value may be impaired\nwhen an Underlying Fund needs to liquidate\nsuch securities. Benchmark interest rates,\nsuch as LIBOR or the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), may not\naccurately track market interest rates. There\nis no guarantee or assurance that: (i) an\nUnderlying Fund will be able to invest in a\ndesired amount of fixed-to-floating rate\nsecurities, (ii) an Underlying Fund will be\nable to buy such securities at a desirable\nprice, or (iii) floating rate securities in\nwhich it invests or seeks to invest will be\nactively traded. Any or all of the foregoing,\nshould they occur, could negatively impact the\nFund. 16 Floating Rate Securities Risk.\nSecurities with floating or variable interest\nrates can be less sensitive to interest rate\nchanges than securities with fixed interest\nrates, but may decline in value if their\ninterest rates do not rise as much, or as\nquickly, as interest rates in general.\nConversely, floating rate securities will not\ngenerally increase in value if interest rates\ndecline. A decline in interest rates may\nresult in a reduction in income received from\nfloating rate securities held by the Fund and\nmay adversely affect the value of the Fund\u2019s\nshares. Generally, floating rate securities\ncarry lower yields than fixed securities of\nthe same maturity. The interest rate for a\nfloating rate security resets or adjusts\nperiodically by reference to a benchmark\ninterest rate. The impact of interest rate\nchanges on floating rate investments is\ntypically mitigated by the periodic interest\nrate reset of the investments. Securities with\nlonger durations tend to be more sensitive to\ninterest rate changes, usually making them\nmore volatile than securities with shorter\ndurations. Floating rate securities generally\nare subject to legal or contractual\nrestrictions on resale, may trade\ninfrequently, and their value may be impaired\nwhen the Fund needs to liquidate such loans.\nBenchmark interest rates, such as LIBOR or\nSOFR, may not accurately track market interest\nrates. Hybrid Securities Risk. Hybrid\nsecurities are securities which contain\ncharacteristics of both a debt security and an\nequity security. Therefore, hybrid securities\nare subject to the risks of equity securities\nand risks of debt securities. The terms of\nhybrid instruments may vary substantially. The\nclaims of holders of hybrid securities of an\nissuer are generally subordinated to those of\nholders of traditional debt securities in\nbankruptcy, and thus hybrid securities may be\nmore volatile and subject to greater risk than\ntraditional debt securities, and may in\ncertain circumstances even be more volatile\nthan traditional equity securities. At the\nsame time, hybrid securities may not fully\nparticipate in gains of their issuer and thus\npotential returns of such securities are\ngenerally more limited than traditional equity\nsecurities, which would participate in such\ngains. Hybrid securities may also be more\nlimited in their rights to participate in\nmanagement decisions of an issuer (such as\nvoting for the board of directors). Certain\nhybrid securities may be more thinly traded\nand less liquid than either publicly issued\nequity securities or debt securities,\nespecially hybrid securities that are \u201c\ncustomized \u201d to meet the needs of particular\ninvestors, potentially making it difficult for\nthe Fund to sell such securities at a\nfavorable price or at all. Any of these\nfeatures could cause a loss in market value of\nhybrid securities held by an Underlying Fund\nor otherwise adversely affect the Fund.\nIndustrials Sector Risk. The value of\nsecurities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply and demand changes related to their\nspecific products or services and industrials\nsector products in general. The products of\nmanufacturing companies may face obsolescence\ndue to rapid technological developments and\nfrequent new product introduction. Global\nevents, trade disputes and changes in\ngovernment regulations, economic conditions\nand exchange rates may adversely affect the\nperformance of companies in the industrials\nsector. Companies in the industrials sector\nmay be adversely affected by liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. The industrials sector may also be\nadversely affected by changes or trends in\ncommodity prices, which may be influenced by\nunpredictable factors. Companies in the\nindustrials sector, particularly aerospace and\ndefense companies, may also be adversely\naffected by government spending policies\nbecause companies in this sector tend to rely\nto a significant extent on government demand\nfor their products and services. Illiquid\nInvestments Risk. The Fund may not acquire any\nilliquid investment if, immediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that the Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without significantly changing the market\nvalue of the investment. Liquid investments\nmay become illiquid after purchase by the\nFund, particularly during periods of market\nturmoil. There can be no assurance that a\nsecurity or instrument that is deemed to be\nliquid when purchased will continue to be\nliquid for as long as it is held by the Fund,\nand any security or instrument held by the\nFund may be deemed an illiquid investment\npursuant to the Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent the Fund\nholds illiquid investments, the illiquid\ninvestments may reduce the returns of the Fund\nbecause the Fund may be unable to transact at\nadvantageous times or prices. An investment\nmay be illiquid due to, among other things,\nthe reduced number and capacity of traditional\nmarket participants to make a market in\nsecurities or instruments, the lack of an\nactive market for such securities or\ninstruments, capital controls, delays or\nlimits on repatriation of local currency, or\ninsolvency of local governments. To the extent\nthat the Fund invests in securities or\ninstruments with substantial market and/or\ncredit risk, the Fund will tend to have\nincreased exposure to the risks associated\nwith illiquid investments. Illiquid\ninvestments may be harder to value, especially\nin changing markets. Although the Fund\nprimarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund\non an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to\nsell underlying investments at reduced prices\nor under unfavorable conditions to meet\nredemption requests or for other cash needs,\nthe Fund may suffer a loss. This may be\nmagnified in a rising interest rate\nenvironment or other circumstances where\nredemptions from the Fund may be greater than\nnormal. Other market participants may be\nattempting to liquidate holdings at the same\ntime as the Fund, causing increased supply of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying investments in the\nmarket and contributing to illiquid\ninvestments risk and downward pricing\npressure. In addition, if the Fund is limited\nin its ability to sell illiquid investments\nduring periods when shareholders are redeeming\ntheir shares, the Fund will need to sell\nliquid securities to meet redemption requests\nand illiquid securities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings. During periods\nof market volatility, liquidity in the market\nfor the Fund\u2019s shares may be impacted by the\nliquidity in the market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by the Fund,\nwhich could lead to the Fund\u2019s shares trading\nat a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.\nInvestment Strategy Risk. The types of\nsecurities that qualify for inclusion in the\nUnderlying Index can be expected to change\nover time. Particular risks may be elevated\nduring periods in which the index methodology\ndictates higher levels of investment in\nparticular types of investments. While the\nindex methodology attempts to screen companies\nfor inclusion in the Underlying Index based on\nfinancial health and a history of growing or\npaying above average dividends, there is no\nguarantee that the securities in the\nUnderlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio\nwill increase in value or that they won\u2019t\ndecline in value. In addition, if the index\nmethodology used by the Index Provider fails\nto accurately predict which stocks will\nperform well, the Fund\u2019s performance will\nsuffer. 17 Large Shareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain shareholders,\nincluding an Authorized Participant, a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s adviser or an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser, a market\nmaker, or another entity, may from time to\ntime own or manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares or may invest in the Fund and hold\ntheir investment for a limited period of time.\nThese shareholders may also pledge or loan\nFund shares (to secure financing or\notherwise), which may result in the shares\nbecoming concentrated in another party. There\ncan be no assurance that any large shareholder\nor large group of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares by these\nshareholders may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the extent the\nFund permits redemptions in cash, these\nredemptions may force the Fund to sell\nportfolio securities when it might not\notherwise do so, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material effect on the\nmarket price of the Shares and increase the\nFund\u2019s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income and/or gains and\ncause the Fund to make taxable distributions\nto its shareholders earlier than the Fund\notherwise would have. In addition, under\ncertain circumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable distribution\nduring or with respect to such tax year. The\nFund also may be required to sell its more\nliquid Fund investments to meet a large\nredemption, in which case the Fund\u2019s remaining\nassets may be less liquid, more volatile, and\nmore difficult to price. To the extent these\nlarge shareholders transact in shares on the\nsecondary market, such transactions may\naccount for a large percentage of the trading\nvolume for the shares of the Fund and may,\ntherefore, have a material upward or downward\neffect on the market price of the Fund shares.\nIn addition, large purchases of Fund shares\nmay adversely affect the Fund\u2019s performance to\nthe extent that the Fund is delayed in\ninvesting new cash and is required to maintain\na larger cash position than it ordinarily\nwould, diluting its investment returns. Latin\nAmerican Economic Risk. The economies of\ncertain Latin American countries have\nexperienced high interest and inflation rates,\neconomic volatility, currency devaluations,\nregime changes, government defaults and high\nunemployment rates. In addition, commodities\n(such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a\nsignificant percentage of the region\u2019s\nexports, and many economies in this region are\nparticularly sensitive to fluctuations in\ncommodity prices. The economies of Latin\nAmerican countries are heavily dependent on\ntrading relationships with key trading\npartners, including the U.S., Europe, Asia and\nother Latin American countries. Adverse\neconomic events in one country may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on other countries\nof this region. In addition, in the past,\ncertain Latin American economies have been\ninfluenced by changing supply and demand for a\nparticular currency, monetary policies of\ngovernments (including exchange control\nprograms, restrictions on local exchanges or\nmarkets and limitations on foreign investment\nin a country or on investment by residents of\na country in other countries), and currency\ndevaluations and revaluations. For example,\nthe government of Brazil imposes a tax on\nforeign investment in Brazilian stocks and\nbonds, which may affect the value of the\nFund's investments in the securities of\nBrazilian issuers. \u25a0 Structural Risk. Certain\nLatin American countries are subject to a\nconsiderable degree of economic, political and\nsocial instability, which could adversely\naffect investments in the Fund. \u25a0 Economic\nRisk. Certain Latin American countries have\nexperienced economic instability resulting\nfrom periods of high inflation and currency\ndevaluations. \u25a0 Political and Social Risk.\nCertain Latin American countries have\nexperienced periods of instability and social\nunrest in the past. For example, Mexico has\nbeen destabilized by local insurrections,\nsocial upheavals and drug related violence.\nDisparities of wealth, the pace and success of\ndemocratization and capital market development\nand ethnic, religious and racial disaffection\nmay exacerbate social unrest, violence and\nlabor unrest in a number of Latin American\ncountries. Certain Latin American countries\nexperience significant unemployment in certain\nregions, as well as widespread\nunderemployment. Materials Sector Risk.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical advances, labor\nrelations, over-production, decreases in the\ndemand for materials, litigation and\ngovernment regulations, among other factors.\nCompanies in the materials sector are also at\nrisk of liability for environmental damage and\nproduct liability claims and may incur\nsignificant environmental remediation costs in\ncomplying with environmental laws. Production\nof materials may exceed demand as a result of\nmarket imbalances or economic downturns,\nleading to poor investment returns. Middle\nEastern Economic Risk. Many Middle Eastern\ncountries have little or no democratic\ntradition, and the political and legal systems\nin such countries may adversely impact the\ncompanies in which the Fund or Underlying Fund\ninvests and, as a result, the value of the\nFund or Underlying Fund. Middle Eastern\ngovernments have exercised and continue to\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector. Many economies\nin the Middle East are highly reliant on\nincome from the sale of oil and natural gas or\ntrade with countries involved in the sale of\noil and natural gas, and their economies are\ntherefore vulnerable to changes in the market\nfor oil and natural gas and foreign currency\nvalues. As global demand for oil and natural\ngas fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies\nmay be significantly impacted. A sustained\ndecrease in commodity prices could have a\nsignificant negative impact on all aspects of\nthe economy in the region. Middle Eastern\neconomies may be subject to acts of terrorism,\npolitical strife, religious, ethnic or\nsocioeconomic unrest and sudden outbreaks of\nhostilities with neighboring countries.\nCertain Middle Eastern countries have strained\nrelations with other Middle Eastern countries\ndue to territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, international alliances,\nreligious tensions or defense concerns, which\nmay adversely affect the economies of these\ncountries. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nexperience significant unemployment, as well\nas widespread underemployment. Many Middle\nEastern countries periodically have\nexperienced political, economic and social\nunrest as protestors have called for\nwidespread reform. Some of these protests have\nresulted in a governmental regime change,\ninternal conflict or civil war. If further\nregime changes were to occur, internal\nconflict were to intensify, or a civil war\nwere to continue in any of these countries,\nsuch instability could adversely affect the 18\neconomies of Middle Eastern countries in which\nthe Fund or Underlying Fund invests and could\ndecrease the value of the Fund\u2019s or Underlying\nFund's investments. National Closed Market\nTrading Risk. To the extent that the\nunderlying securities or other instruments\nheld by the Fund or an Underlying Fund trade\non foreign exchanges or in foreign markets\nthat may be closed when the securities\nexchange on which the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying\nFund's shares trade is open, there are likely\nto be deviations between the current price of\nan underlying security and the last quoted\nprice for the underlying security ( i.e. , the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's quote from the\nclosed foreign market). The impact of a closed\nforeign market on the Fund or an Underlying\nFund is likely to be greater where a large\nportion of the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\nunderlying securities or other instruments\ntrade on that closed foreign market or when\nthe foreign market is closed for unscheduled\nreasons. These deviations could result in\npremiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than\nthose experienced by other ETFs. Non-U.S.\nAgency Debt Risk. The Fund and certain\nUnderlying Funds may invest in\nuncollateralized bonds issued by agencies,\nsubdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign\ngovernments. Bonds issued by these foreign\ngovernment agencies, subdivisions or\ninstrumentalities are generally backed only by\nthe creditworthiness and reputation of the\nentities issuing the bonds and may not be\nbacked by the full faith and credit of the\nforeign government. Moreover, a foreign\ngovernment that explicitly provides its full\nfaith and credit to a particular entity may\nbe, due to changed circumstances, unable or\nunwilling to actually provide that support. If\na non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its\nobligations, the performance of the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund will be adversely impacted. A\nnon-U.S. agency\u2019s operations and financial\ncondition are influenced by the foreign\ngovernment\u2019s economic and other policies.\nChanges to the financial condition or credit\nrating of a foreign government may cause the\nvalue of debt issued by that particular\nforeign government\u2019s agencies, subdivisions or\ninstrumentalities to decline. During periods\nof economic uncertainty, the trading of\nnon-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while\nmarket prices may be more volatile than prices\nof U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks\nassociated with non-U.S. agency investing\ninclude differences in accounting, auditing\nand financial reporting standards, adverse\nchanges in investment or exchange control\nregulations, political instability, which\ncould affect U.S. investments in foreign\ncountries, and potential restrictions of the\nflow of international capital. North American\nEconomic Risk . A decrease in imports or\nexports, changes in trade regulations or an\neconomic recession in any North American\ncountry can have a significant economic effect\non the entire North American region and on\nsome or all of the North American countries in\nwhich the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests.\nThe U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest\ntrading and investment partner. The Canadian\nand Mexican economies are significantly\naffected by developments in the U.S. economy.\nSince the implementation of the North American\nFree Trade Agreement ( \u201c NAFTA \u201d ) in 1994\namong Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total\nmerchandise trade among the three countries\nhas increased. However, political developments\nincluding the implementation of tariffs by the\nU.S. and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the\nform of the United States-Mexico-Canada\nAgreement ( \u201c USMCA \u201d ), which replaced NAFTA\non July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North\nAmerica\u2019s economic outlook and, as a result,\nthe value of securities held by the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund. Policy and legislative\nchanges in one country may have a significant\neffect on North American markets generally, as\nwell as on the value of certain securities\nheld by the Fund or an Underlying Fund.\nPreferred Stock Risk. Unlike interest payments\non a debt security, dividend payments on\npreferred stock typically must be declared by\nthe issuer's board of directors. An issuer's\nboard of directors is generally not under any\nobligation to pay dividends (even if such\ndividends have accrued), and may suspend\npayment of dividends on preferred stock at any\ntime. In the event an issuer of preferred\nstock experiences economic difficulties, the\nissuer's preferred stock may lose substantial\nvalue due to the reduced likelihood that the\nissuer's board of directors will declare\ndividends and the fact that the preferred\nstock may be subordinated to other securities\nof the same issuer. Certain additional risks\nassociated with preferred stock could\nadversely affect investments in an Underlying\nFund. Interest Rate Risk. Because many\npreferred stocks pay dividends at a fixed\nrate, their market price can be sensitive to\nchanges in interest rates in a manner similar\nto bonds. That is, as interest rates rise, the\nvalue of the preferred stocks held by an\nUnderlying Fund is likely to decline. To the\nextent that an Underlying Fund invests a\nsubstantial portion of its assets in fixed\nrate preferred stocks, rising interest rates\nmay cause the value of the Fund's investments\nto decline significantly. Issuer Risk. Because\nmany preferred stocks allow holders to convert\nthe preferred stock into common stock of the\nissuer, market price of a preferred stock can\nbe sensitive to changes in the value of the\nissuer's common stock. To the extent that an\nUnderlying Fund invests a substantial portion\nof its assets in convertible preferred stocks,\ndeclining common stock values may also cause\nthe value of the Fund's investments to\ndecline. Dividend Risk. There is a chance that\nthe ability to pay dividends by the issuer of\na preferred stock held by an Underlying Fund\nmay deteriorate or the issuer may default (\ni.e., fail to make scheduled dividend payments\non the preferred stock or scheduled interest\npayments on other obligations of the issuer\nnot held by an Underlying Fund), which would\nnegatively affect the value of any such\nholding. Call Risk. Preferred stocks are\nsubject to market volatility, and the prices\nof preferred stocks will fluctuate based on\nmarket demand. Preferred stocks often have\ncall features that allow the issuer to redeem\nthe security at its discretion. If a preferred\nstock is redeemed by the issuer, it will be\nremoved from and Underlying Fund's underlying\nindex. The redemption of preferred stocks\nhaving a higher than average yield may cause a\ndecrease in the yield of an Underlying Fund\nand the Fund. Because an Underlying Fund's\nunderlying index is rebalanced annually, the\nremoval of a large number of preferred stocks\nduring the year due to maturity, redemption,\nconversion or other corporate action may cause\nan Underlying Fund's underlying index to be\nperiodically concentrated in a smaller number\nof issuers or in issuers of a particular\nsector or industry. 19 Extension Risk. During\nperiods of rising interest rates, certain\nobligations will be paid off substantially\nmore slowly than originally anticipated, and\nthe value of those securities may fall\nsharply, resulting in a decline to the Fund\u2019s\nincome and potentially in the value of the\nFund\u2019s investments. Privatization Risk. Some\ncountries in which the Underlying Funds have\nexposure have privatized, or have begun the\nprocess of privatizing, certain entities and\nindustries. Newly privatized companies may\nface strong competition from government-\nsponsored competitors that have not been\nprivatized. In some instances, investors in\nnewly privatized entities have suffered losses\ndue to the inability of the newly privatized\nentities to adjust quickly to a competitive\nenvironment or changing regulatory and legal\nstandards or, in some cases, due to re-\nnationalization of such privatized entities.\nThere is no assurance that similar losses will\nnot recur. Real Estate Companies Risk. Real\nestate companies, which include real estate\ninvestment trusts, real estate holding and\noperating companies, and real estate\nmanagement or development companies, expose\ninvestors to the risks of owning real estate\ndirectly as well as to the risks from the way\nthat such companies operate. Real estate\ncompanies and property values may be adversely\naffected by regulations and other governmental\nactions, including tax increases, zoning\nchanges and other usage restrictions,\nenvironmental regulations, regulatory\nlimitations on rent or eviction, and eminent\ndomain. Certain real estate companies, such as\nREITs, could fail to qualify for favorable tax\nor regulatory treatment. Real estate is highly\nsensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and can be subject to intense\ncompetition and periodic overbuilding. Real\nestate companies may own a limited number of\nproperties and concentrate their investments\nin a particular geographic region, industry or\nproperty type. Economic downturns or other\nadverse events ( e.g ., natural disasters)\nthat affect a particular region, industry or\nproperty type may lead to decreases in\nproperty values, leasing declines and defaults\nby borrowers or tenants. In the event of a\ndefault, a real estate company may experience\nsubstantial delays and costs in enforcing its\nrights with respect to the property and\nprotecting its investment. In addition,\nbecause real estate is relatively illiquid, a\ncompany may be constrained in its ability to\ndiversify or liquidate its investments in\nresponse to economic conditions or other\nevents. Real estate companies may depend on\nthe management skills of a few key individuals\nand may have limited financial resources. They\nmay be highly leveraged, which can magnify\nlosses, and interest rate increases can make\nit difficult for them, as well as borrowers\nand tenants, to obtain debt financing and meet\npayment obligations. Declining interest rates\ncould result in increased prepayment on loans\nand require redeployment of capital in less\ndesirable investments. Certain real estate\ncompanies, such as REITs, could fail to\nqualify for favorable tax or regulatory\ntreatment, which could produce adverse\neconomic consequences for the company and its\ninvestors, including a Fund. Risk of Investing\nin Brazil. Investment in Brazilian issuers\ninvolves risks that are specific to Brazil,\nincluding legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency and economic risks. Specifically,\nBrazilian issuers are subject to possible\nregulatory and economic interventions by the\nBrazilian government, including the imposition\nof wage and price controls and the limitation\nof imports. The economy of Brazil has\nhistorically been negatively affected by\ncorruption scandals involving private\ncompanies and government officials, which have\nled to sanctions against firms. In addition,\nthe market for Brazilian securities is\ndirectly influenced by the flow of\ninternational capital and economic and market\nconditions of certain countries, especially\nother emerging market countries in Central and\nSouth America. The Brazilian economy has\nhistorically been exposed to high rates of\ninflation and a high level of debt, each of\nwhich may reduce and/or prevent economic\ngrowth. A rising unemployment rate could also\nhave the same effect. Risk of Investing in the\nChina Bond Market. The Fund invests in the\nChina Interbank Bond Market through the\nnorthbound trading of Bond Connect. Bond\nConnect allows investors to trade between the\nmainland China and Hong Kong markets\nelectronically, which eliminates the need for\ninvestor status and quotas that were required\nunder previous access models. Under the\nprevailing regulations in the PRC, eligible\nforeign investors such as the Fund are allowed\nto invest in the bonds circulated in the China\nInterbank Bond Market through Bond Connect.\nThe settlement and custody of bonds traded in\nthe China Interbank Bond Market under Bond\nConnect will be effected through the\nsettlement and custody link between CMU, as an\noffshore custody agent, and CCDC and SCH, as\nonshore custodians and clearing institutions\nin the PRC. All bonds traded by eligible\nforeign investors through Bond Connect will be\nregistered in the name of CMU, which will hold\nsuch bonds as a nominee owner. Therefore, the\nFund will be exposed to custody risks with\nrespect to CMU. In addition, as the relevant\nfilings, registration with the People\u2019s Bank\nof China, and account opening have to be\ncarried out by third parties, including CMU,\nCCDC, and SCH, the Fund is subject to the\nrisks of default or errors and omissions on\nthe part of such third parties and may have\nlimited remedies or no legal recourse at all\nto cure such defaults, errors and omissions.\nThe precise nature and rights of the Fund as\nthe beneficial owner of the bonds traded in\nthe China Interbank Bond Market through CMU as\nnominee are relatively new and untested areas\nof PRC law. The definition of, and distinction\nbetween, legal ownership and beneficial\nownership under PRC law differs from that in\nthe U.S. and other developed market\njurisdictions, there have been few cases\ninvolving a nominee account structure in the\nPRC courts and, as a result, the rights of\nbeneficial owners are uncertain. The exact\nnature of the Fund's remedies and methods of\nthe rights and interests of the Fund under PRC\nlaw are also uncertain. Market volatility and\npotential lack of liquidity due to low trading\nvolume of certain bonds in the China Interbank\nBond Market may result in prices of certain\nbonds traded on such market to fluctuate\nsignificantly. The Fund investing in the China\nInterbank Bond Market is therefore subject to\nliquidity and volatility risks. The bid-ask\nspreads of the prices of such securities may\nbe large, and the Fund may therefore incur 20\nsignificant costs and may suffer losses when\nselling such investments. The bonds traded in\nthe China Interbank Bond Market may be\ndifficult or impossible to sell on a timely\nbasis or at all, which may impact the Fund's\nability to acquire or dispose of such\nsecurities at their expected prices. Investing\nin the China Interbank Bond Market through\nBond Connect is also subject to regulatory\nrisks. The relevant rules and regulations are\nsubject to change, which may have potential\nretrospective effect, and there can be no\nassurance that Bond Connect or certain\nfeatures or systems thereof will not be\nmaterially altered, suspended, discontinued or\nabolished. Furthermore, the securities\nregulation regimes and legal systems of the\nPRC and Hong Kong differ significantly and\nissues may arise based on these differences.\nIn the event that the relevant authorities\nsuspend account opening or trading on the\nChina Interbank Bond Market, the Fund's\nability to invest in the China Interbank Bond\nMarket will be adversely affected, limited, or\ncurtailed altogether. In such event, the\nFund's ability to achieve its investment\nobjective will be negatively affected and,\nafter exhausting other trading alternatives,\nthe Fund may suffer substantial losses as a\nresult. Further, if Bond Connect is not\noperating, a Fund may not be able to acquire\nor dispose of bonds through Bond Connect in a\ntimely manner, which could adversely affect\nthe Fund's performance. Trading through Bond\nConnect is performed through newly developed\ntrading platforms and operational systems.\nThere is no assurance that such systems will\nfunction as expected or will continue to be\nadapted to changes and developments in the\nmarket. In the event that a relevant system\ndoes not function as expected, trading through\nBond Connect may be disrupted. The Fund's\nability to trade through Bond Connect (and\nhence to pursue its investment strategy) may\ntherefore be adversely affected. In addition,\nwhere the Fund invests in the China Interbank\nBond Market through Bond Connect, it may be\nsubject to risks of delays inherent in the\norder placing and/or settlement systems. Bond\nConnect trades are settled in Chinese\ncurrency, the renminbi ( \u201c RMB \u201d ). This means\nthat the Fund will be exposed to currency\nrisk, and it cannot be guaranteed that\ninvestors will have timely access to a\nreliable supply of RMB. The RMB consists of an\nonshore RMB ( \u201c CNY \u201d ) and an offshore RMB (\n\u201c CNH \u201d ). The CNY is the official currency of\nthe PRC and is the currency of denomination\nfor all financial transactions between\nindividuals, the state and corporations in the\nPRC. Hong Kong is the first jurisdiction to\nallow for the accumulation of RMB deposits in\nthe form of CNH outside the PRC. Since 2010,\nthe CNH market is traded officially and\nregulated jointly by the Hong Kong Monetary\nAuthority and the PBOC. While CNY and CNH are\nthe same currency, they are traded in\ndifferent and separate markets. Therefore, CNY\nand CNH can be subject to different liquidity\nconstraints and market forces, meaning their\nvaluations can vary. The RMB-denominated bonds\nincluded in the Underlying Index use CNY as\nthe base currency. As a result, to the extent\nthat the Fund holds RMB-denominated\ninstruments in CNH, it could be subject to\ntracking error and potential foreign exchange\ntransaction costs associated with converting\nfrom CNH to CNY (and vice versa). Under\nprevailing tax regulations, a 10% withholding\ntax is imposed on PRC-sourced dividends and\ninterest from non-government bonds paid to the\nFund unless the rate is reduced under an\napplicable tax treaty. Value Added Tax ( \u201c VAT\n\u201d ) is levied on certain income derived by the\nFund, including interest income from non-\ngovernment bonds and trading gains, unless\nspecifically exempted by the PRC tax\nauthorities. VAT exemptions currently apply to\ndebt securities traded in the China Interbank\nBond Market. On November 22, 2018, the PRC\u2019s\nMinistry of Finance and State Administration\nof Taxation jointly issued Circular 108\nproviding foreign institutional investors with\na temporary exemption from withholding income\ntax and VAT with respect to interest income\nderived from non-government bonds in the\ndomestic bond market for the period from\nNovember 7, 2018 to November 6, 2021. On\nNovember 26, 2021, the PRC's Ministry of\nFinance and State Administration of Taxation\njointly issued Circular 34 to extend the tax\nexemption period provided in Circular 108 to\nDecember 31, 2025. Circular 108 is silent on\nthe PRC tax treatment with respect to non-\ngovernment bond interest derived prior to\nNovember 7, 2018. There is a risk the PRC tax\nauthorities may withdraw the temporary tax\nexemptions in the future and seek to collect\nwithholding income tax and VAT on interest\nincome from non-government bonds to the Fund\nwithout prior notice. If the tax exemptions\nare withdrawn, any taxes arising from or to\nthe Fund may be directly borne by or\nindirectly passed on to the Fund, which may\nresult in a substantial impact to its NAV. As\nwith any NAV adjustment, investors may be\nadvantaged or disadvantaged depending on when\nthe investors purchased or sold shares of the\nFund. Any changes in PRC tax law, future\nclarifications thereof, and/or subsequent\nretroactive enforcement by the PRC tax\nauthorities may result in a loss which could\nbe material to the Fund. BFA will keep the\nprovisioning policy for tax liability under\nreview and may, in its discretion from time to\ntime, make a provision for potential tax\nliabilities if in its opinion such provision\nis warranted or as further publicly clarified\nby the PRC. Risk of Investing in Developed\nCountries. Developed countries generally tend\nto rely on services sectors ( e.g., the\nfinancial services sector) as the primary\nmeans of economic growth. A prolonged slowdown\nin one or more services sectors is likely to\nhave a negative impact on economies of certain\ndeveloped countries, although economies of\nindividual developed countries can be impacted\nby slowdowns in other sectors. In the past,\ncertain developed countries have been targets\nof terrorism, and some geographic areas in\nwhich the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests\nhave experienced strained international\nrelations due to territorial disputes,\nhistorical animosities, defense concerns and\nother security concerns. These situations may\ncause uncertainty in the financial markets in\nthese countries or geographic areas and may\nadversely affect the performance of the\nissuers to which the Fund or an Underlying\nFund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain\nmarkets, including labor and product markets,\nmay have an adverse effect on certain issuers.\nSuch regulations may negatively affect\neconomic growth or cause prolonged periods of\nrecession. Many developed countries are\nheavily indebted and face rising healthcare\nand retirement expenses. In addition, price\nfluctuations of certain commodities and\nregulations impacting the import of\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Risk of Investing in\nEmerging Markets. Investments in emerging\nmarket issuers are subject to a greater risk\nof loss than investments in issuers located or\noperating in more developed markets. This is\ndue to, among other things, the potential for\ngreater market volatility, lower trading\nvolume, higher levels of inflation, social,\npolitical or economic instability, greater\nrisk of a market shutdown and more\ngovernmental limitations on foreign\ninvestments in emerging market countries than\nare typically found in more developed markets.\n21 Some countries in which the Fund may invest\nmay experience economic instability, including\ninstability resulting from substantial rates\nof inflation or significant devaluations of\ntheir currency, or economic recessions, which\nwould have a negative effect on the economies\nand securities markets of their economies.\nSome of these countries may also impose\nrestrictions on the exchange or export of\ncurrency or adverse currency exchange rates\nand may be characterized by a lack of\navailable currency hedging instruments.\nDisparities of wealth, the pace and success of\ndemocratization and ethnic, religious and\nracial disaffection, among other factors, may\nexacerbate social unrest, violence and labor\nunrest in some of the countries in which the\nFund may invest. Unanticipated or sudden\npolitical or social developments may result in\nsudden and significant investment losses.\nCompanies in many emerging markets are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries, and as a result, information about\nthe securities in which the Fund invests may\nbe less reliable or complete. Moreover,\nemerging markets often have less reliable\nsecurities valuations and greater risks\nassociated with custody of securities than\ndeveloped markets. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and shareholders may have limited\nlegal remedies. The Fund is not actively\nmanaged and does not select investments based\non investor protection considerations. In\naddition, emerging markets often have greater\nrisk of capital controls through such measures\nas taxes or interest rate control than\ndeveloped markets. Certain emerging market\ncountries may also lack the infrastructure\nnecessary to attract large amounts of foreign\ntrade and investment. Chronic structural\npublic sector deficits in some countries in\nwhich the Fund may invest may adversely impact\nsecurities held by the Fund. Local securities\nmarkets in emerging market countries may trade\na small number of securities and may be unable\nto respond effectively to changes in trading\nvolume, potentially making prompt liquidation\nof holdings difficult or impossible at times.\nSettlement procedures in emerging market\ncountries are frequently less developed and\nreliable than those in the U.S. (and other\ndeveloped countries). In addition, significant\ndelays may occur in certain markets in\nregistering the transfer of securities.\nSettlement or registration problems may make\nit more difficult for the Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund to value its portfolio\nsecurities and could have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund or the Underlying Fund in seeking to\nachieve its investment objective. Investing in\nemerging market countries involves a higher\nrisk of loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and on repatriation of\ncapital invested in certain emerging market\ncountries. As a result, investments in certain\ncountries in which the Fund may invest may be\nsubject to loss due to expropriation or\nnationalization of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on foreign\ninvestments and repatriation of capital. Local\nsecurities markets in emerging market\ncountries may trade a small number of\nsecurities and may be unable to respond\neffectively to increases in trading volume,\npotentially making prompt liquidation of\nholdings difficult or impossible at times.\nSettlement procedures in emerging market\ncountries are frequently less developed and\nreliable than those in the U.S. (and other\ndeveloped countries). In addition, significant\ndelays may occur in certain markets in\nregistering the transfer of securities.\nSettlement or registration problems may make\nit more difficult for an Underlying Fund to\nvalue its portfolio securities and could cause\nan Underlying Fund to miss attractive\ninvestment opportunities. Investing in\nemerging market countries involves a great\nrisk of loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and on repatriation of\ncapital invested in certain emerging market\ncountries. Risk of Investing in Frontier\nMarkets. Frontier markets are those emerging\nmarkets considered to be among the smallest,\nleast mature and the securities of the issuers\nof which are the least liquid. Investments in\nfrontier markets generally are subject to a\ngreater risk of loss than investments in\ndeveloped markets or traditional emerging\nmarkets. This is due to, among other things,\nsmaller economies, less developed capital\nmarkets, greater market volatility, lower\ntrading volume, political and economic\ninstability, greater risk of a market\nshutdown, capital controls, delays or limits\non repatriation of local currency, insolvency\nof local governments, and more governmental\nlimitations on foreign investments than\ntypically found in more developed markets.\nFrontier markets are even more prone to\neconomic shocks associated with political and\neconomic risks than are emerging markets\ngenerally. Many frontier market countries may\nbe dependent on commodities, foreign trade or\nforeign aid. As a result, those risks\ntraditionally associated with investments in\nemerging markets may be more pronounced with\nrespect to investments in frontier market\neconomies. Risk of Investing in Japan. Japan\nmay be subject to political, economic, and\nlabor risks, among others. Any of these risks,\nindividually or in the aggregate, can impact\nan investment made in Japan. Currency Risk .\nThe Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at\ntimes, and any increase in its value may cause\na decline in exports that could weaken the\nJapanese economy. The Japanese government has,\nin the past, intervened in the currency\nmarkets to attempt to maintain or reduce the\nvalue of the yen. Japanese intervention in the\ncurrency markets could cause the value of the\nyen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and\ncould cause losses to investors. Economic Risk\n. The growth of Japan's economy has recently\nlagged that of its Asian neighbors and other\nmajor developed economies. Since 2000, Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth rate has generally remained\nlow relative to other advanced economies, and\nit may remain low in the future. The Japanese\neconomy is heavily dependent on international\ntrade and has been adversely affected in the\npast by trade tariffs, other 22 protectionist\nmeasures, competition from emerging economies\nand the economic conditions of its trading\npartners. Japan is also heavily dependent on\noil and other commodity imports, and higher\ncommodity prices could therefore have a\nnegative impact on the Japanese economy.\nGeographic Risk. Natural disasters, such as\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and\ntsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding\nareas and could negatively affect the Japanese\neconomy, and, in turn, could negatively affect\nthe value of the Fund. Labor Risk . Japan has\nan aging workforce and has experienced a\nsignificant population decline in recent\nyears. Japan\u2019s labor market appears to be\nundergoing fundamental structural changes, as\na labor market traditionally accustomed to\nlifetime employment adjusts to meet the need\nfor increased labor mobility, which may\nadversely affect Japan\u2019s economic\ncompetitiveness. Large Government and\nCorporate Debt Risk . The Japanese economy\nfaces several concerns, including a financial\nsystem with large levels of nonperforming\nloans, over-leveraged corporate balance\nsheets, extensive cross-ownership by major\ncorporations, a changing corporate governance\nstructure, and large government deficits.\nThese issues may cause a slowdown of the\nJapanese economy. Political Risk .\nHistorically, Japan has had unpredictable\nnational politics and may experience frequent\npolitical turnover. Future political\ndevelopments may lead to changes in policy\nthat might adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. In addition, China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan. Japan's\npolitical relationship with China, however, is\nstrained and delicate. Should political\ntension increase, it could adversely affect\nthe Japanese economy and destabilize the\nregion as a whole. Security Risk. Japan's\nrelations with its neighbors, particularly\nChina, North Korea, South Korea and Russia,\nhave at times been strained due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities and defense\nconcerns. Most recently, the Japanese\ngovernment has shown concern over the\nincreased nuclear and military activity by\nNorth Korea and China. Strained relations may\ncause uncertainty in the Japanese markets and\nadversely affect the overall Japanese economy,\nparticularly in times of crisis. Risk of\nInvesting in Mexico. Investment in Mexican\nissuers involves risks that are specific to\nMexico, including regulatory, political,\ncurrency and economic risks. The Mexican\neconomy is dependent upon trade with other\neconomies, specifically with the U.S. and\ncertain Latin American countries. As a result,\nMexico is dependent on, among other things,\nthe U.S. economy, and any change in the price\nor demand for Mexican exports may have an\nadverse impact on the Mexican economy. For\nexample, lower oil prices have negatively\nimpacted Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, the Mexican\nState-owned petroleum company, which accounts\nfor a significant percentage of the Mexican\ngovernment's tax revenue. Mexico has\nexperienced adverse economic impacts as a\nresult of earthquakes and hurricanes, as well\nas outbreaks of violence. Incidents involving\nMexico\u2019s security may have an adverse effect\non the Mexican economy and cause uncertainty\nin its financial markets. In the past, Mexico\nhas experienced high interest rates, economic\nvolatility and high unemployment rates.\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk. If certain\naggregate and/or fund-level ownership\nthresholds are reached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates or an\nUnderlying Fund, or as a result of third-party\ntransactions or actions by an issuer or\nregulator, the ability of BFA and its\naffiliates on behalf of clients (including an\nUnderlying Fund) to purchase or dispose of\ninvestments, or exercise rights or undertake\nbusiness transactions, may be restricted by\nregulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity\nof an Underlying Fund to make investments in\ncertain securities may be affected by the\nrelevant threshold limits, and such\nlimitations may have adverse effects on the\nliquidity and performance of an Underlying\nFund\u2019s portfolio holdings compared to the\nperformance of such a fund's underlying index.\nThis may increase the risk of an Underlying\nFund being underinvested to the Underlying\nIndex and increase the risk of tracking error.\nFor example, in certain circumstances where an\nUnderlying Fund invests in securities issued\nby companies that operate in certain regulated\nindustries or in certain emerging or\ninternational markets, is subject to corporate\nor regulatory ownership restrictions, or\ninvests in certain futures or other derivative\ntransactions, there may be limits on the\naggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or\nvoted by BFA and its affiliates for their\nproprietary accounts and for client accounts\n(including an Underlying Fund) that may not be\nexceeded without the grant of a license or\nother regulatory or corporate consent or, if\nexceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates,\nthe Fund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. U.S.\nEconomic Risk. The U.S. is a significant, and\nin some cases the most significant, trading\npartner of, or foreign investor in, certain\ncountry or countries in which an Underlying\nFund invests. As a result, economic conditions\nof such countries may be particularly affected\nby changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in\nU.S. imports or exports, new trade and\nfinancial regulations or tariffs, changes in\nthe U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic\nslowdown in the U.S. may have a material\nadverse effect on the economic conditions of\nsuch countries and, as a result, securities to\nwhich an Underlying Fund has exposure.\nCircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal on\nU.S. government debt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d Such non-payment\nwould result in substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. U.S. Treasury\nObligations Risk. U.S. Treasury obligations\nmay differ from other securities in their\ninterest rates, maturities, times of issuance\nand other characteristics. Similar to other\nissuers, changes to the financial condition or\ncredit rating of the U.S. government may cause\nthe value of the Fund's or an Underlying\nFund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.\nU.S. Treasury securities are rated AA+ by S&P\nGlobal Ratings. A downgrade of the rating of\nU.S. Treasury securities may cause the value\nof the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to\ndecline. Because U.S. government debt\nobligations are often used as a benchmark for\nother borrowing arrangements, a downgrade\ncould also result in higher interest rates for\na range of borrowers, cause disruptions in the\ninternational bond markets and have a\nsubstantial adverse effect on the U.S. and\nglobal economy. 23\n\nA high national debt level may increase market\npressures to meet government funding needs,\nwhich may drive debt cost higher and lead the\ngovernment to issue additional debt, thereby\nincreasing refinancing risk. A high national\ndebt also raises concerns that the U.S.\ngovernment will not be able to make principal\nor interest payments when they are due. If\nmarket participants determine that U.S.\nsovereign debt levels have become\nunsustainable, the value of the U.S. dollar\ncould decline, thus increasing inflationary\npressures, particularly with respect to\nservices outsourced to non-U.S. providers and\nimported goods, and constrain or prevent the\nU.S. government from implementing effective\ncountercyclical fiscal policy in economic\ndownturns. Direct obligations of the U.S.\nTreasury have historically involved little\nrisk of loss of principal if held to maturity.\nHowever, due to fluctuations in interest\nrates, the market value of such securities may\nvary during the period that shareholders own\nshares of the Fund. Notwithstanding that U.S.\nTreasury obligations are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the United States,\ncircumstances could arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or principal,\nsuch as reaching the legislative \u201c debt\nceiling. \u201d Such non-payment would result in\nlosses to the Fund and substantial negative\nconsequences for the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation A description of the Trust's\npolicies and procedures with respect to the\ndisclosure of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities\nis available in the Fund's Statement of\nAdditional Information ( \u201c SAI \u201d ). The Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com.

A Further Discussion of\nPrincipal Investment Strategies Overview The\nFund allocates and reallocates its assets\namong the Underlying Funds consistent with the\nallocation and reallocation of securities in\nthe Underlying Index as determined by\nMorningstar. In addition to investing in the\nUnderlying Funds, the Fund may borrow, lend\nits portfolio securities to brokers, dealers\nand financial institutions, and may invest the\ncollateral in certain short-term instruments,\neither directly or through one or more money\nmarket funds, as described in greater detail\nin the Fund's SAI. Certain Underlying Funds\nmay invest in non-U.S. securities, emerging\nmarkets securities and debt instruments, which\nare subject to additional risks, as described\nin this Prospectus and in the Fund's SAI. The\ninvestment model for the Underlying Index is\nintended to represent a fixed allocation\nstrategy designed to deliver high current\nincome. The Underlying Funds The Fund seeks to\ntrack the investment results of an index\ncomposed of underlying equity, fixed-income\nand other income funds that collectively seek\nto deliver high current income while providing\nan opportunity for capital appreciation. Each\nUnderlying Fund generally holds assets that\nform a sub-set of the securities comprising\nthe Underlying Index. The Fund's allocation of\nassets to the Underlying Funds will generally\nclosely reflect the allocation weights\nrepresented in the Underlying Index. The\nfollowing table lists each Fund's investments\nand asset allocation as of September 23, 2024.\nBFA allocates the Fund\u2019s assets among the\nUnderlying Funds in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective and policies. Any\nremaining assets are allocated to the\nBlackRock Cash Funds. BFA is not required to\ninvest the Fund\u2019s assets in all of the\nUnderlying Funds or in any particular\npercentage in any given Underlying Fund.\nUnderlying Fund Allocation Weights\n(as of September 23, 2024)\n                                              \n                            Underlying Funds  \n  iShares Agency Bond ETF   4.97%             \n  iShares Broad USD High    14.96%            \n  Yield Corporate Bond ETF                    \n  iShares Core 1-5 Year     14.94%            \n  USD Bond ETF                                \n  iShares Core U.S. REIT    3.39%             \n  ETF                                         \n  iShares Floating Rate     14.84%            \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  iShares Global REIT ETF   1.77%             \n  iShares J.P.

In managing each of the Underlying\nFunds, BFA uses a representative sampling\nindex strategy. Representative sampling is an\nindexing strategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively have an investment profile\nsimilar to a specified benchmark index.\nSecurities selected for the Underlying Funds\nare expected to have, in the aggregate,\ninvestment characteristics (based on factors\nsuch as market capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of the applicable\nunderlying index. The Underlying Funds may or\nmay not hold all of the securities that are\nincluded in their respective underlying\nindexes and may hold certain securities that\nare not included in their respective\nunderlying indexes. Additional information\nregarding the Underlying Funds and their\nprincipal investment strategies is provided\nbelow. iShares Agency Bond ETF The iShares\nAgency Bond ETF seeks to track the investment\nresults of the Bloomberg U.S. Agency Bond\nIndex, which measures the performance of the\nagency sector of the U.S. government bond\nmarket and is composed of investment-grade (as\ndetermined by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\n( \u201c Bloomberg \u201d )) U.S. dollar-denominated\npublicly-issued government agency bonds or\ndebentures.

The MSCI EAFE Index has\nbeen developed by MSCI Inc. ( \u201c MSCI \u201d ) to\nmeasure the equity market performance of\ndeveloped markets outside of the U.S. and\nCanada. Constituents of the MSCI EAFE Value\nIndex include securities from Europe,\nAustralasia and the Far East. The MSCI EAFE\nValue Index targets approximately 50% coverage\nof the free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization of the MSCI EAFE Index and\nconsists of those securities classified by\nMSCI as most representing the value style of\ninvesting. Securities classified in this style\ngenerally tend to have higher value\ncharacteristics ( i.e ., higher book value to\nprice, 12-month forward earnings to price and\ndividend yield). MSCI uses a specialized\nframework to attribute both value and growth\nstyle characteristics to each security within\nthe MSCI EAFE Index. Each security is\nevaluated based on certain value factors and\ngrowth factors, which are then used to\ncalculate a value score and growth score.\nBased upon these two scores, MSCI determines\nthe extent to which each security is assigned\nto the value or growth style. It is possible\nfor a single security to have representation\nin both the value and growth style indexes;\nhowever, no more than 100% of a security\u2019s\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization will be\nincluded within the combined style framework.\nThe MSCI EAFE Value Index includes large- and\nmid-capitalization companies and may change\nover time. As of July 31, 2023, the MSCI EAFE\nValue Index consisted of securities from the\nfollowing countries or regions: Australia,\nAustria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\nJapan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPortugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland and the U.K. As of July 31, 2023,\na significant portion of the MSCI EAFE Value\nIndex is represented by securities of\ncompanies in the financials industry or\nsector.

The ICE Exchange-Listed\nPreferred & Hybrid Securities Index includes\nissuances of preferred stocks with amounts\noutstanding over $100 million, convertible\npreferred stock with at least $50 million face\namount outstanding, and hybrid securities with\nat least $250 million face amount outstanding,\nthat meet minimum maturity and other\nrequirements, as applicable, as determined by\nIDI. 28 In general, preferred stock is a class\nof equity security that pays a specified\ndividend that must be paid before any\ndividends can be paid to common stockholders\nand takes precedence over common stock in the\nevent of a company\u2019s liquidation. In general,\na \u201c hybrid \u201d security refers to a security\nwhich combines both debt and equity\ncharacteristics. In general, hybrid securities\nincluded in the ICE Exchange-Listed Preferred\n& Hybrid Securities Index, like traditional\npreferred stock, have preference over the\ncommon stock within an issuer\u2019s capital\nstructure, and are issued and traded in a\nsimilar manner to traditional preferred stock.\nLike debt securities and preferred stock (but\nunlike common stock), issuers of hybrid\nsecurities included in the ICE Exchange-Listed\nPreferred & Hybrid Securities Index may make\nfixed, periodic payments to the holders of\nsuch securities. Like preferred stock, issuers\nof hybrid securities included in the ICE\nExchange-Listed Preferred & Hybrid Securities\nIndex have the ability to defer dividend\npayments and to extend such securities\u2019\nmaturity dates. Although preferred stocks\nrepresent a partial ownership interest in a\ncompany, preferred stocks generally do not\ncarry voting rights. Preferred stocks have\neconomic characteristics similar to fixed-\nincome securities. Preferred stocks and hybrid\nsecurities generally are issued with a fixed\npar value and pay dividends based on a\npercentage of that par value at a fixed or\nvariable rate. Additionally, preferred stocks\nand hybrid securities often have a liquidation\nvalue that generally equals the original\npurchase price of such security at the date of\nissuance. The ICE Exchange-Listed Preferred &\nHybrid Securities Index may include many\ndifferent categories of preferred stock and\nhybrid securities, such as floating and fixed\nrate preferreds, fixed-to-floating rate\nsecurities, callable preferreds, convertible\npreferreds, cumulative and non-cumulative\npreferreds, certain capital securities, trust\npreferreds or various other preferred stock\nand hybrid securities. The total allocation to\nan individual issuer across the entire ICE\nExchange-Listed Preferred & Hybrid Securities\nIndex is limited to 4.75%. The ICE Exchange-\nListed Preferred & Hybrid Securities Index\nuses a market capitalization weighted\nmethodology subject to certain constraints and\nis rebalanced monthly. The ICE Exchange-Listed\nPreferred & Hybrid Securities Index may\ninclude large-, mid- or small-capitalization\ncompanies and includes preferred stocks and\nhybrid securities of non-U.S. issuers. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nICE Exchange-Listed Preferred & Hybrid\nSecurities Index is represented by securities\nof companies in the financials and industrials\nindustries or sectors. The components of the\nICE Exchange-Listed Preferred & Hybrid\nSecurities Index are likely to change over\ntime.

Management Investment\nAdviser. As investment adviser, BFA has\noverall responsibility for the general\nmanagement and administration of the Fund. BFA\nprovides an investment program for the Fund\nand manages the investment of the Fund\u2019s\nassets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw\nupon the research and expertise of its asset\nmanagement affiliates with respect to certain\nportfolio securities. In seeking to achieve\nthe Fund's investment objective, BFA uses\nteams of portfolio managers, investment\nstrategists and other investment specialists.\nThis team approach brings together many\ndisciplines and leverages BFA\u2019s extensive\nresources. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory\nAgreement between BFA and the Trust (entered\ninto on behalf of the Fund), BFA is\nresponsible for substantially all expenses of\nthe Fund, except the management fees, interest\nexpenses, taxes, expenses incurred with\nrespect to the acquisition and disposition of\nportfolio securities and the execution of\nportfolio transactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or expenses,\nand litigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses (as determined by a majority of the\nTrustees who are not \u201c interested persons \u201d of\nthe Trust). Operating expenses paid by BFA\nunder the Investment Advisory Agreement\nexclude Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if\nany. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023,\nBFA was paid a management fee from the Fund,\nas a percentage of the Fund's average daily\nnet assets, net of any applicable waivers, at\nthe annual rate of 0.24%. BFA has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fee in order to limit the Fund\u2019s\ntotal annual fund operating expenses after the\nfee waiver to 0.60% through November 30, 2026.\nThe contractual waiver may be terminated prior\nto November 30, 2026 only upon written\nagreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition,\nBFA may from time to time voluntarily waive\nand/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to\nlimit total annual fund operating expenses\n(excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if\nany). Any such voluntary waiver or\nreimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime. BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San\nFrancisco, CA 94105. It is an indirect wholly-\nowned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. ( \u201c\nBlackRock \u201d ). As of September 30, 2023, BFA\nand its affiliates provided investment\nadvisory services for assets of approximately\n$9.1 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade\nand invest for their own accounts in the\nactual securities and types of securities in\nwhich the Fund may also invest, which may\naffect the price of such securities. A\ndiscussion regarding the basis for the\napproval by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the\n\u201c Board \u201d ) of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement with BFA is available in the Fund's\nAnnual Report for the period ended July 31.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer Hsui, Greg Savage\nand Paul Whitehead are primarily responsible\nfor the day-to-day management of the Fund. The\nPortfolio Managers are responsible for various\nfunctions related to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to, investing cash\ninflows, coordinating with members of their\nrespective portfolio management teams to focus\non certain asset classes, implementing 29\ninvestment strategy, researching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and overseeing members of\ntheir respective portfolio management teams\nwho have more limited responsibilities.\nJennifer Hsui has been employed by BFA or its\naffiliates as a senior portfolio manager since\n2007. Prior to that, Ms. Hsui was a portfolio\nmanager from 2006 to 2007 for Barclays Global\nFund Advisors ( \u201c BGFA \u201d ). Ms. Hsui has been\na Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2022.\nGreg Savage has been employed by BFA or its\naffiliates as a senior portfolio manager since\n2006.

The Fund's SAI provides additional\ninformation about the Portfolio Managers'\ncompensation, other accounts managed by the\nPortfolio Managers and the Portfolio Managers'\nownership (if any) of shares in the Fund.\nAdministrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent.\nCitibank, N.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d ) is the\nadministrator, custodian and transfer agent\nfor the Fund. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. serves\nas custodian for the Fund in connection with\ncertain securities lending activities.\nConflicts of Interest. The investment\nactivities of BFA and its affiliates\n(including BlackRock and its subsidiaries\n(collectively, the \u201c Affiliates \u201d )), and\ntheir respective directors, officers or\nemployees, in the management of, or their\ninterest in, their own accounts and other\naccounts they manage, may present conflicts of\ninterest that could disadvantage the Fund and\nits shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates\nprovide investment management services to\nother funds and discretionary managed accounts\nthat may follow investment programs similar to\nthat of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are\ninvolved worldwide with a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset management\nactivities and may engage in the ordinary\ncourse of business in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests of their\nclients may conflict with those of the Fund.\nBFA or one or more Affiliates act, or may act,\nas an investor, research provider, investment\nmanager, commodity pool operator, commodity\ntrading advisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent\nand/or principal, and have other direct and\nindirect interests in securities, currencies,\ncommodities, derivatives and other instruments\nin which the Fund may directly or indirectly\ninvest. The Fund may invest in securities of,\nor engage in other transactions with,\ncompanies with which an Affiliate has\nsignificant debt or equity investments or\nother interests. The Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured notes) by\nentities for which an Affiliate provides and\nis compensated for cash management services\nrelating to the proceeds from the sale of such\nissuances. The Fund also may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in other transactions\nwith, companies for which an Affiliate\nprovides or may in the future provide research\ncoverage. An Affiliate may have business\nrelationships with, and purchase or distribute\nor sell services or products from or to,\ndistributors, consultants or others who\nrecommend the Fund or who engage in\ntransactions with or for the Fund, and may\nreceive compensation for such services. BFA or\none or more Affiliates may engage in\nproprietary trading and advise accounts and\nfunds that have investment objectives similar\nto those of the Fund and/or that engage in and\ncompete for transactions in the same types of\nsecurities, currencies and other instruments\nas the Fund. This may include transactions in\nsecurities issued by other open-end and\nclosed-end investment companies (which may\ninclude investment companies that are\naffiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the\nextent permitted under the Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as amended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d )).\nThe trading activities of BFA and these\nAffiliates are carried out without reference\nto positions held directly or indirectly by\nthe Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate\nhaving positions in certain securities that\nare senior or junior to, or have interests\ndifferent from or adverse to, the securities\nthat are owned by the Fund. Neither BlackRock\nnor any Affiliate is under any obligation to\nshare any investment opportunity, idea or\nstrategy with the Fund. As a result, an\nAffiliate may compete with the Fund for\nappropriate investment opportunities. The\nresults of the Fund's investment activities,\ntherefore, may differ from those of an\nAffiliate and of other accounts managed by\nBlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible\nthat the Fund could sustain losses during\nperiods in which one or more Affiliates and\nother accounts achieve profits on their\ntrading for proprietary or other accounts. The\nopposite result is also possible. In addition,\nthe Fund may, from time to time, enter into\ntransactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or\nits or their directors, officers, employees or\nclients have an adverse interest. Furthermore,\ntransactions undertaken by clients advised or\nmanaged by BFA or its Affiliates may adversely\nimpact the Fund. Transactions by one or more\nclients or by BFA or its Affiliates or their\ndirectors, officers or employees may have the\neffect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging\nthe values, prices or investment strategies of\nthe Fund. The Fund's activities may be limited\nbecause of regulatory restrictions applicable\nto BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their\ninternal policies designed to comply with such\nrestrictions. Under a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board, the Fund has\nretained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as\nthe securities lending agent for the Fund to\nthe extent that the Fund participates in the\nsecurities lending program. For these\nservices, the securities lending agent will\nreceive a fee from the Fund, including a fee\nbased on the returns earned on the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment of the cash received as collateral\nfor the loaned securities. In addition, one or\nmore Affiliates may be among the entities to\nwhich the Fund may lend its portfolio\nsecurities under the securities lending\nprogram. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the\nFund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC\n(the \u201c Distributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an\nAffiliate of BFA, to perform certain order\nprocessing, Authorized Participant\ncommunications, and related services in\nconnection with the issuance and redemption of\nCreation Units of the Fund ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d\n). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard\ntransaction fee received from Authorized\nParticipants on each creation or redemption\norder from the Authorized Participant for the\nETF Services provided. BlackRock collaborated\n30 with, and received payment from, Citibank,\non the design and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may have, or from\ntime to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its affiliates. It is also possible\nthat, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its\nadvisory clients (including other funds and\nseparately managed accounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, purchase and\nhold shares of the Fund. The price,\navailability, liquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by\npurchases and sales of the Fund by BlackRock\nand/or its advisory clients. The activities of\nBFA and its Affiliates and their respective\ndirectors, officers or employees may give rise\nto other conflicts of interest that could\ndisadvantage the Fund and its shareholders.\nBFA has adopted policies and procedures\ndesigned to address these potential conflicts\nof interest. See the SAI for further\ninformation. Shareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder information, including\nhow to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is\navailable free of charge by calling toll-free:\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our\nwebsite at www.iShares.com. Buying and Selling\nShares. Shares of the Fund may be acquired or\nredeemed directly from the Fund only in\nCreation Units or multiples thereof, as\ndiscussed in the Creations and Redemptions\nsection of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized\nParticipant may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund. Once created, shares of the Fund\ngenerally trade in the secondary market in\namounts less than a Creation Unit. Shares of\nthe Fund are listed on a national securities\nexchange for trading during the trading day.\nShares can be bought and sold throughout the\ntrading day like shares of other publicly\ntraded companies. The Trust does not impose\nany minimum investment for shares of the Fund\npurchased on an exchange or otherwise in the\nsecondary market. The Fund's shares trade\nunder the ticker symbol \u201c IYLD. \u201d Buying or\nselling Fund shares on an exchange or other\nsecondary market involves two types of costs\nthat may apply to all securities transactions.\nWhen buying or selling shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. The commission\nis frequently a fixed amount and may be a\nsignificant proportional cost for investors\nseeking to buy or sell small amounts of\nshares. In addition, you may incur the cost of\nthe \u201c spread, \u201d that is, any difference\nbetween the bid price and the ask price. The\nspread varies over time for shares of the Fund\nbased on the Fund\u2019s trading volume and market\nliquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund\nhas high trading volume and market liquidity,\nand higher if the Fund has little trading\nvolume and market liquidity (which is often\nthe case for funds that are newly launched or\nsmall in size). The Fund's spread may also be\nimpacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of\nthe underlying securities held by the Fund,\nparticularly for newly launched or smaller\nfunds or in instances of significant\nvolatility of the underlying securities. The\nFund does not impose restrictions on the\nfrequency of purchases and redemptions of Fund\nshares directly with the Fund. The Board\ndetermined not to adopt policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent or monitor for\nfrequent purchases and redemptions of Fund\nshares because the Fund generally sells and\nredeems its shares directly through\ntransactions that are in-kind and/or for cash,\nwith a deadline for placing cash-related\ntransactions no later than the close of the\nprimary markets for the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities. However, the Fund has taken\ncertain measures ( e.g ., imposing transaction\nfees on purchases and redemptions of Creation\nUnits and reserving the right to reject\npurchases of Creation Units under certain\ncircumstances) to minimize the potential\nconsequences of frequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized Participants, such\nas increased tracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution to the Fund,\nand/or increased transaction costs. Further,\nthe vast majority of trading in Fund shares\noccurs on the secondary market, which does not\ninvolve the Fund directly, and such trading is\nunlikely to cause many of the harmful effects\nof frequent cash purchases or redemptions of\nFund shares. The national securities exchange\non which the Fund's shares are listed is open\nfor trading Monday through Friday and is\nclosed on weekends and the following holidays\n(or the days on which they are observed): New\nYear\u2019s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents\u2019 Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,\nJuneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange is Cboe BZX. Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts\ninvestments by investment companies, including\nforeign and unregistered investment companies,\nin the securities of other investment\ncompanies. For example, a registered\ninvestment company (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or\notherwise dispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any investment company\n(the \u201c Acquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company or\ncompanies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if,\nimmediately after such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or\n(ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by\nthe Acquiring Fund and other investment\ncompanies and companies controlled by them.\nAlthough SEC rules may permit registered\ninvestment companies and unit investment\ntrusts ( \u201c Investing Funds \u201d ) that enter into\nan investment agreement with the Trust to\ninvest in iShares funds beyond the limits set\nforth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\nsubject to certain terms and conditions, the\nFund does not permit such investments.\nAccordingly, Investing Funds must adhere to\nthe limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of\nthe 1940 Act when investing in the Fund. In\naddition, foreign investment companies are\npermitted to invest in the Fund only up to the\nlimits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject\nto any applicable SEC no-action relief. Book\nEntry. Shares of the Fund are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The Depository Trust\nCompany ( \u201c DTC \u201d ) or its nominee is the\nrecord owner of, and holds legal title to, all\noutstanding shares of the Fund. 31 Investors\nowning shares of the Fund are beneficial\nowners as shown on the records of DTC or its\nparticipants. DTC serves as the securities\ndepository for shares of the Fund. DTC\nparticipants include securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and other institutions that\ndirectly or indirectly maintain a custodial\nrelationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner\nof shares, you are not entitled to receive\nphysical delivery of stock certificates or to\nhave shares registered in your name, and you\nare not considered a registered owner of\nshares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an\nowner of shares, you must rely upon the\nprocedures of DTC and its participants. These\nprocedures are the same as those that apply to\nany other securities that you hold in book-\nentry or \u201c street name \u201d form. Share Prices.\nThe trading prices of the Fund\u2019s shares in the\nsecondary market generally differ from the\nFund\u2019s daily NAV and are affected by market\nforces such as the supply of and demand for\nETF shares and shares of underlying securities\nheld by the Fund, economic conditions and\nother factors. Determination of Net Asset\nValue. The NAV for each Fund normally is\ndetermined once daily Monday through Friday,\ngenerally as of the close of regular trading\nhours of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern\ntime) on each day that the NYSE is open for\ntrading, based on prices at the time of\nclosing, provided that any Fund assets or\nliabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates on the\ndate of valuation as quoted by one or more\ndata service providers. The NAV of the Fund is\ncalculated by dividing the value of the net\nassets of the Fund ( i.e. , the value of its\ntotal assets, which includes the values of the\nUnderlying Fund shares in which the Fund\ninvests, less total liabilities) by the total\nnumber of outstanding shares of the Fund,\ngenerally rounded to the nearest cent. The\nvalue of the securities and other assets and\nliabilities held by the Fund is determined\npursuant to BFA\u2019s valuation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been designated by the\nBoard as the valuation designee for the Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act.\nEquity securities and other equity instruments\nfor which market quotations are readily\navailable are valued at market value, which is\ngenerally determined using the last reported\nofficial closing price or, if a reported\nclosing price is not available, the last\ntraded price on the exchange or market on\nwhich the security or instrument is primarily\ntraded at the time of valuation. Shares of\nunderlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at net asset value.\nShares of underlying exchange-traded closed-\nend funds or other ETFs are valued at their\nmost recent closing price. Generally, trading\nin non-U.S. securities and money market\ninstruments is substantially completed each\nday at various times prior to the close of\nregular trading hours of the NYSE. The values\nof such securities used in computing the NAV\nof the Fund are determined as of such times.\nWhen market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in accordance with its policies\nand procedures. BFA may conclude that a market\nquotation is not readily available or is\nunreliable if a security or other asset or\nliability does not have a price source due to\nits lack of trading or other reasons, if a\nmarket quotation differs significantly from\nrecent price quotations or otherwise no longer\nappears to reflect fair value, where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is thinly\ntraded, when there is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent market\nquotation, or if the trading market on which a\nsecurity is listed is suspended or closed and\nno appropriate alternative trading market is\navailable. A \u201c significant event \u201d is deemed\nto occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable\nbusiness judgment prior to or at the time of\npricing the Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities, that\nthe event is likely to cause a material change\nto the last exchange closing price or closing\nmarket price of one or more assets held by, or\nliabilities of, the Fund. Fair value\nrepresents a good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset or liability. The fair value\nof an asset or liability held by the Fund is\nthe amount the Fund might reasonably expect to\nreceive from the current sale of that asset or\nthe cost to extinguish that liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments using fair value pricing will\nresult in prices that may differ from current\nmarket valuations and that may not be the\nprices at which those investments could have\nbeen sold during the period in which the\nparticular fair values were used. Use of fair\nvalue prices and certain current market\nvaluations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate the\nFund\u2019s NAV and the prices used by the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn, could result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the Underlying Index.\nDividends and Distributions. General Policies.\nDividends from net investment income, if any,\ngenerally are declared and paid at least once\na year by the Fund. The Fund generally\ndistributes its net capital gains, if any, to\nshareholders annually. Distributions of net\nrealized securities gains, if any, generally\nare declared and paid once a year, but the\nTrust may make distributions on a more\nfrequent basis for the Fund. The Trust\nreserves the right to declare special\ndistributions if, in its reasonable\ndiscretion, such action is necessary or\nadvisable to preserve its status as a\nregulated investment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) or to\navoid imposition of income or excise taxes on\nundistributed income or realized gains.\nDividends and other distributions on shares of\nthe Fund are distributed on a pro rata basis\nto beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend\npayments are made through DTC participants and\nindirect participants to beneficial owners\nthen of record with proceeds received from the\nFund. Dividend Reinvestment Service. No\ndividend reinvestment service is provided by\nthe Trust. Broker-dealers may make available\nthe DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment\nService for use by beneficial owners of the\nFund for reinvestment of their dividend\ndistributions. Beneficial owners should\ncontact their broker to determine the\navailability and costs of the service and the\ndetails of participation therein. Brokers may\nrequire beneficial owners to adhere to\nspecific procedures and timetables. If this\nservice is available and used, dividend\ndistributions of both income and realized\ngains will be automatically reinvested in\nadditional whole shares of the Fund purchased\nin the secondary market. 32 Note on Tax\nInformation. The following sections summarize\nsome of the consequences under current U.S.\nfederal tax law of an investment in the Fund.\nIt is not a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. You may also be subject to state and\nlocal taxation on Fund distributions and sales\nof shares. Certain states and localities may\nexempt from tax distributions attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal government\nobligations. Consult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of the Fund under all\napplicable tax laws. Taxes. As with any\ninvestment, you should consider how your\ninvestment in shares of the Fund will be\ntaxed. The tax information in this Prospectus\nis provided as general information, based on\ncurrent law. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of the Fund. Unless your\ninvestment in Fund shares is made through a\ntax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement\naccount, such as an IRA, in which case your\ndistributions generally will be taxable when\nwithdrawn, you need to be aware of the\npossible tax consequences when the Fund makes\ndistributions or you sell Fund shares. Taxes\non Distributions. Distributions from the\nFund\u2019s net investment income (other than\nqualified dividend income), including\ndistributions of income from securities\nlending and distributions out of the Fund\u2019s\nnet short-term capital gains, if any, are\ntaxable to you as ordinary income.\nDistributions by the Fund of net long-term\ncapital gains, if any, in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses (capital gain dividends)\nare taxable to you as long-term capital gains,\nregardless of how long you have held the\nFund\u2019s shares. Distributions by the Fund that\nqualify as qualified dividend income are\ntaxable to you at long-term capital gain\nrates. Long-term capital gains and qualified\ndividend income are generally eligible for\ntaxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for\nnon-corporate shareholders, depending on\nwhether their income exceeds certain threshold\namounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal\nMedicare contribution tax is imposed on \u201c net\ninvestment income, \u201d including, but not\nlimited to, interest, dividends, and net gain,\nof U.S. individuals with income exceeding\n$200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing\njointly) and of estates and trusts. Dividends\nwill be qualified dividend income to you if\nthey are attributable to qualified dividend\nincome received by the Fund. Generally,\nqualified dividend income includes dividend\nincome from taxable U.S. corporations and\nqualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that\nthe Fund satisfies certain holding period\nrequirements in respect of the stock of such\ncorporations and has not hedged its position\nin the stock in certain ways. Substitute\ndividends received by the Fund with respect to\ndividends paid on securities lent out will not\nbe qualified dividend income. For this\npurpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation\nmeans any non-U.S. corporation that is\neligible for benefits under a comprehensive\nincome tax treaty with the U.S., which\nincludes an exchange of information program,\nor if the stock with respect to which the\ndividend was paid is readily tradable on an\nestablished U.S. securities market. The term\nexcludes a corporation that is a passive\nforeign investment company. Dividends received\nby the Fund from a RIC generally are qualified\ndividend income only to the extent such\ndividend distributions are made out of\nqualified dividend income received by such\nRIC. Additionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by the Fund from a REIT and\ndistributed to a shareholder generally will be\ntaxable to the shareholder as ordinary income.\nHowever, for tax years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026,\nthe Fund may report dividends eligible for a\n20% \u201c qualified business income \u201d deduction\nfor non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the\nextent the Fund\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable\nFund expenses. For a dividend to be treated as\nqualified dividend income, the dividend must\nbe received with respect to a share of stock\nheld without being hedged by the Fund, and\nwith respect to a share of the Fund held\nwithout being hedged by you, for 61 days\nduring the 121-day period beginning at the\ndate which is 60 days before the date on which\nsuch share becomes ex-dividend with respect to\nsuch dividend or, in the case of certain\npreferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day\nperiod beginning 90 days before such date.\nFund distributions, to the extent attributable\nto dividends from U.S. corporations, will be\neligible for the dividends received deduction\nfor Fund shareholders that are corporations,\nsubject to certain hedging and holding\nrequirements. In general, your distributions\nare subject to U.S. federal income tax for the\nyear when they are paid. Certain distributions\npaid in January, however, may be treated as\npaid on December 31 of the prior year. Short\nterm capital gains earned by an Underlying\nFund will be ordinary income when distributed\nto the Fund and will not be offset by the\nFund's capital losses. Because the Fund is\nexpected to invest in the Underlying Funds,\nthe Fund\u2019s realized losses on sales of shares\nof an Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or\npermanently deferred as \u201c wash sales \u201d .\nCapital loss carryforwards of an Underlying\nFund, if any, would not offset net capital\ngains of the Fund. If the Fund\u2019s distributions\nexceed current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits, all or a portion of the distributions\nmade in the taxable year may be\nrecharacterized as a return of capital to\nshareholders. Distributions in excess of the\nFund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements, but\nnot in excess of the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. A return of capital distribution\ngenerally will not be taxable but will reduce\nthe shareholder\u2019s cost basis and result in a\nhigher capital gain or lower capital loss when\nthose shares on which the distribution was\nreceived are sold. Once a shareholder's cost\nbasis is reduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as capital gain,\nif the shareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets. Dividends, interest and\ncapital gains earned by an Underlying Fund\nwith respect to securities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers may give rise to withholding and other\ntaxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If\nmore than 50% of the total assets of an\nUnderlying Fund at the close of a year\nconsists of non-U.S. stocks or securities\n(generally, for this purpose, depositary\nreceipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S.\ncompanies are treated as \u201c non-U.S. \u201d ) (and\n50% of the 33 total assets of a Fund at the\nclose of the year consists of foreign\nsecurities, or, at the close of each quarter,\nshares of Underlying Funds), a Fund may \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to you certain non-U.S. income taxes\n(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund. For purposes of foreign\ntax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund,\nforeign capital gains taxes may not produce\nassociated foreign source income, thereby\nlimiting a U.S. person\u2019s ability to use such\ncredits. If you are neither a resident nor a\ncitizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S.\nentity (other than a pass-through entity to\nthe extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term capital gains)\nwill generally be subject to a 30% U.S.\nwithholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate\napplies, provided that withholding tax will\ngenerally not apply to any gain or income\nrealized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect\nof any distributions of long-term capital\ngains or upon the sale or other disposition of\nshares of the Fund. Separately, a 30%\nwithholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\n( \u201c IRS \u201d ) information regarding their direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders and (ii)\ncertain other foreign entities, unless they\ncertify certain information regarding their\ndirect and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid\nwithholding, foreign financial institutions\nwill need to (i) enter into agreements with\nthe IRS that state that they will provide the\nIRS information, including the names,\naddresses and taxpayer identification numbers\nof direct and indirect U.S. account holders,\ncomply with due diligence procedures with\nrespect to the identification of U.S.\naccounts, report to the IRS certain\ninformation with respect to U.S. accounts\nmaintained, agree to withhold tax on certain\npayments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information,\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event that an applicable intergovernmental\nagreement and implementing legislation are\nadopted, provide local revenue authorities\nwith similar account holder information. Other\nforeign entities may need to report the name,\naddress, and taxpayer identification number of\neach substantial U.S. owner or provide\ncertifications of no substantial U.S.\nownership unless certain exceptions apply. If\nyour Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending arrangement, you may lose\nthe ability to treat Fund dividends paid while\nthe shares are held by the borrower as\nqualified dividend income. In addition, you\nmay lose the ability to use foreign tax\ncredits passed through by the Fund if your\nFund shares are loaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending agreement. If you are a\nresident or a citizen of the U.S., by law,\nbackup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to\nyour distributions and proceeds if you have\nnot provided a taxpayer identification number\nor social security number and made other\nrequired certifications. Taxes When Shares Are\nSold. Currently, any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon a sale of Fund shares is\ngenerally treated as a long-term gain or loss\nif the shares have been held for more than one\nyear. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a\nsale of Fund shares held for one year or less\nis generally treated as short-term gain or\nloss, except that any capital loss on the sale\nof shares held for six months or less is\ntreated as long-term capital loss to the\nextent that capital gain dividends were paid\nwith respect to such shares. Any such capital\ngains, including from sales of Fund shares or\nfrom capital gain dividends, are included in \u201c\nnet investment income \u201d for purposes of the\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax\nmentioned above. Creations and Redemptions.\nPrior to trading in the secondary market,\nshares of the Fund are \u201c created \u201d at NAV by\nmarket makers, large investors and\ninstitutions only in block-size Creation Units\nor multiples thereof. Each \u201c creator \u201d or\nauthorized participant (an \u201c Authorized\nParticipant \u201d ) has entered into an agreement\nwith the Fund's Distributor, an affiliate of\nBFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. A creation transaction,\nwhich is subject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the Fund, generally takes\nplace when an Authorized Participant deposits\ninto the Fund a designated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other positions (a \u201c\ncreation basket \u201d ), and an amount of cash\n(including any cash representing the value of\nsubstituted securities, assets or other\npositions), if any, which together approximate\nthe holdings of the Fund in exchange for a\nspecified number of Creation Units. Similarly,\nshares can be redeemed only in Creation Units,\ngenerally for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other positions (a \u201c\nredemption basket \u201d ) held by the Fund and an\namount of cash (including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be substituted).\nThe Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer\nCreation Units partially or solely for cash.\nExcept when aggregated in Creation Units,\nshares are not redeemable by the Fund.\nCreation and redemption baskets may differ and\nthe Fund may accept \u201c custom baskets. \u201d More\ninformation regarding custom baskets is\ncontained in the Fund's SAI. The prices at\nwhich creations and redemptions occur are\nbased on the next calculation of NAV after a\ncreation or redemption order is received in an\nacceptable form under the authorized\nparticipant agreement. Only an Authorized\nParticipant may create or redeem Creation\nUnits with the Fund. Authorized Participants\nmay create or redeem Creation Units for their\nown accounts or for customers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of the Fund. In\nthe event of a system failure or other\ninterruption, including disruptions at market\nmakers or Authorized Participants, orders to\npurchase or redeem Creation Units either may\nnot be executed according to the Fund's\ninstructions or may not be executed at all, or\nthe Fund may not be able to place or change\norders. To the extent the Fund engages in in-\nkind transactions, the Fund intends to comply\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws in\naccepting securities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with redemption\nsecurities by, among other means, assuring\nthat any securities accepted 34 for deposit\nand any securities used to satisfy redemption\nrequests will be sold in transactions that\nwould be exempt from registration under the\n1933 Act. Further, an Authorized Participant\nthat is not a \u201c qualified institutional buyer,\n\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 144A under\nthe 1933 Act, will not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. Creations and redemptions\nmust be made through a firm that is either a\nmember of the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the National Securities Clearing\nCorporation or a DTC participant that has\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Unit aggregations. Information about\nthe procedures regarding creation and\nredemption of Creation Units (including the\ncut-off times for receipt of creation and\nredemption orders) is included in the Fund's\nSAI. Because new shares may be created and\nissued on an ongoing basis, at any point\nduring the life of the Fund a \u201c distribution,\n\u201d as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be\noccurring. Broker-dealers and other persons\nare cautioned that some activities on their\npart may, depending on the circumstances,\nresult in their being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters subject to the\nprospectus delivery and liability provisions\nof the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether\none is an underwriter must take into account\nall the relevant facts and circumstances of\neach particular case. Broker-dealers should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are participating in a\ndistribution (as contrasted to ordinary\nsecondary transactions), and thus dealing with\nshares that are part of an \u201c unsold allotment\n\u201d within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of\nthe 1933 Act, would be unable to take\nadvantage of the prospectus delivery exemption\nprovided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act.\nFor delivery of prospectuses to exchange\nmembers, the prospectus delivery mechanism of\nRule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only\nwith respect to transactions on a national\nsecurities exchange. Householding.\nHouseholding is an option available to certain\nFund investors. Householding is a method of\ndelivery, based on the preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a single copy of\ncertain shareholder documents can be delivered\nto investors who share the same address, even\nif their accounts are registered under\ndifferent names. Please contact your broker-\ndealer if you are interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a single copy of\nprospectuses and other shareholder documents,\nor if you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change your\nhouseholding status. Distribution The\nDistributor or its agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the Fund on an agency basis. The\nDistributor does not maintain a secondary\nmarket in shares of the Fund. The Distributor\nhas no role in determining the policies of the\nFund or the securities that are purchased or\nsold by the Fund. The Distributor\u2019s principal\naddress is 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001. BFA or its affiliates make payments to\nbroker-dealers, registered investment\nadvisers, banks or other intermediaries\n(together, \u201c intermediaries \u201d ) related to\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, data provision services, or\ntheir making shares of the Fund and certain\nother iShares funds available to their\ncustomers generally and in certain investment\nprograms. Such payments, which may be\nsignificant to the intermediary, are not made\nby the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by\nBFA or its affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or indirectly\nin part from fees paid by the iShares funds\ncomplex. Payments of this type are sometimes\nreferred to as revenue-sharing payments. A\nfinancial intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it recommends\nor makes available, or the level of services\nprovided, to its customers based on the\npayments or other financial incentives it is\neligible to receive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives offered or made\nto an intermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary and its\ncustomers and may cause the intermediary to\nrecommend the Fund or other iShares funds over\nanother investment. More information regarding\nthese payments is contained in the Fund's and\neach Underlying Fund's SAI. Please contact\nyour salesperson or other investment\nprofessional for more information regarding\nany such payments his or her firm may receive\nfrom BFA or its affiliates. 35\n\nFinancial Highlights The financial highlights\ntable is intended to help investors understand\nthe Fund\u2019s financial performance for the past\nfive years. Certain information reflects\nfinancial results for a single share of the\nFund.

This Example is intended\nto help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other\nfunds. The Example assumes that\nyou invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated\nand then sell all of your shares\nat the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each\nyear and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs\nmay be higher or lower, based on\nthese assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $15         $98     $202      $504  \n                                      \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund and\nthe underlying funds in which the\nFund invests (each, an \u201c\nUnderlying Fund \u201d and\ncollectively, the \u201c Underlying\nFunds \u201d ) may pay transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when\nthey buy and sell securities (or\n\u201c turn over \u201d their portfolios).\nA higher portfolio turnover rate\nfor the Fund or Underlying Funds\nmay indicate higher transaction\ncosts and may cause the Fund or\nthe Underlying Funds to incur\nincreased expenses. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses or\nin the Example (except costs to\nUnderlying Funds included as part\nof Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses), affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. During the most\nrecent fiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate was 39%\nof the average value of its\nportfolio. To the extent the\nUnderlying Funds incur costs from\nhigh portfolio turnover, such\ncosts may have a negative effect\non the performance of the Fund.\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\nThe Fund is a fund of funds and\nseeks to track the investment\nresults of the Morningstar \u00ae U.S.\nBond Market Yield-Optimized Index\nSM (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ).\nThe Underlying Index consists\nexclusively of underlying iShares\nexchange-traded funds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d\n) that themselves seek investment\nresults corresponding to their\nown underlying indexes. The Fund\ninvests primarily in the\nUnderlying Funds and cash and\ncash equivalents, including\nshares of money market funds\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates\n( \u201c BlackRock Cash Funds \u201d ). The\nUnderlying Index is a broadly\ndiversified fixed-income index\nthat seeks to deliver current\nincome while maintaining long-\nterm capital appreciation. The\nUnderlying Index is composed of\nUnderlying Funds within fixed-\nincome sectors that collectively\nhave demonstrated relatively high\nrisk-adjusted income on a\nconsistent basis and meet\nliquidity characteristics as\ndetermined by Morningstar, Inc.\u2019s\n( \u201c Morningstar \u201d or the \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ) proprietary index\nmethodology. The goal of the\nUnderlying Index is to represent\nan allocation to five distinct\nfixed-income sectors, with the\nexposure to each sector capped at\na specified percentage of the\nUnderlying Index. The five\nsectors currently included in the\nUnderlying Index, and each\nsector\u2019s respective current caps,\nare: between 10% to 50% U.S.\ngovernment and government-related\nfixed-income securities, between\n10% to 50% U.S. securitized\nfixed-income securities, S-2\n\nbetween 10% to 50% U.S.\ninvestment-grade (as determined\nby Morningstar) credit\nsecurities, no more than 20% U.S.\nnon-investment-grade credit\nsecurities and no more than 10%\nemerging market debt. These five\nsectors are represented by\nUnderlying Funds that Morningstar\nconsiders to deliver higher risk-\nadjusted yields. Each fixed-\nincome sector has its own return\nand risk profile. The combined\nallocation percentages of the\nfive represented sectors will\nequal 100%. The Underlying Index\nis rebalanced and reconstituted\nquarterly. As of September 23,\n2024, the Underlying Index\nincluded the following Underlying\nFunds within (i) the U.S.\ngovernment related sector:\niShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond\nETF; (ii) the U.S. securitized\nsector: iShares CMBS ETF; (iii)\nthe U.S. investment-grade credit\nsector: iShares 10+ Year\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond\nETF and iShares Floating Rate\nBond ETF; (iv) the U.S. non-\ninvestment-grade sector: iShares\nBroad USD High Yield Corporate\nBond ETF; and (v) the emerging\nmarket debt sector: iShares J.P.\nMorgan EM High Yield Bond ETF.\nThe Underlying Index may add,\neliminate or replace Underlying\nFunds at reconstitution. The\nUnderlying Index may indirectly\ninclude securities issued by\nsovereign entities. As of\nSeptember 23, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Underlying Funds'\nUnderlying Indexes is represented\nby securities of companies in the\nfinancials industry or sector.\nThe components of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies,\nthe Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not\nseek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or\nappear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially\noutperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the\nrisks of active management, such\nas poor security selection.\nIndexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep\nportfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. To the\nextent that BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an\napplicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected\nto have, in the aggregate,\ninvestment characteristics (based\non factors such as market value\nand industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability and yield)\nand liquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund or each\nUnderlying Fund may or may not\nhold all of the securities in the\napplicable Underlying Index. The\nFund will invest at least 80% of\nits assets in the component\nsecurities of the Underlying\nIndex and to-be-announced\ntransactions ( \u201c TBAs \u201d ) that\nhave economic characteristics\nthat are substantially identical\nto the economic characteristics\nof the component securities of\nthe Underlying Index, and the\nFund will invest at least 90% of\nits assets in fixed income\nsecurities of the types included\nin the Underlying Index that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track\nthe Underlying Index. The Fund\nS-3 will invest no more than 10%\nof its assets in futures, options\nand swaps contracts that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track\nthe Underlying Index as well as\nin fixed income securities other\nthan the types included in the\nUnderlying Index, but which BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track\nthe Underlying Index. Cash and\ncash equivalent investments\nassociated with a TBA position\nwill be treated as part of that\nposition for purposes of\ncalculating investments in the\ncomponent securities of the\nUnderlying Index. Cash and cash\nequivalent investments associated\nwith a derivative position will\nbe treated as part of that\nposition for the purposes of\ncalculating the percentage of\ninvestments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks\nto track the investment results\nof the Underlying Index before\nfees and expenses of the Fund.\nThe Fund may lend securities\nrepresenting up to one-third of\nthe value of the Fund's total\nassets (including the value of\nany collateral received). The\nUnderlying Index is sponsored by\nMorningstar, which is independent\nof the Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition and relative\nweightings of the securities in\nthe Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding\nthe market value of the\nUnderlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments\n( i.e. , hold 25% or more of its\ntotal assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries\nto approximately the same extent\nthat the Underlying Index is\nconcentrated. For purposes of\nthis limitation, securities of\nthe U.S. government (including\nits agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase\nagreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities are not\nconsidered to be issued by\nmembers of any industry. Summary\nof Principal Risks As with any\ninvestment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the\nFund, and the Fund's performance\ncould trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject\nto certain risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below\n(either directly or through its\ninvestments in the Underlying\nFunds), any of which may\nadversely affect the Fund's NAV,\ntrading price, yield, total\nreturn and ability to meet its\ninvestment objective. Certain key\nrisks are prioritized below (with\nothers following in alphabetical\norder), but the relative\nsignificance of any risk is\ndifficult to predict and may\nchange over time. You should\nreview each risk factor\ncarefully. Interest Rate Risk .\nDuring periods of very low or\nnegative interest rates, the Fund\nmay be unable to maintain\npositive returns or pay dividends\nto Fund shareholders. Very low or\nnegative interest rates may\nmagnify interest rate risk.\nChanging interest rates,\nincluding rates that fall below\nzero, may have unpredictable\neffects on markets, result in\nheightened market volatility and\ndetract from the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to the extent the\nFund is exposed to such interest\nrates. Additionally, under\ncertain market conditions in\nwhich interest rates are low and\nthe market prices for portfolio\nsecurities have increased, the\nFund may have a very low or even\nnegative yield. A low or negative\nyield would cause the Fund to\nlose money in certain conditions\nand over certain time periods. An\nincrease in interest rates will\ngenerally cause the value of\nsecurities held by the Fund or\nS-4 an Underlying Fund to\ndecline, may lead to heightened\nvolatility in the fixed-income\nmarkets and may adversely affect\nthe liquidity of certain fixed-\nincome investments, including\nthose held by the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund. Because rates on\ncertain floating rate debt\nsecurities typically reset only\nperiodically, changes in\nprevailing interest rates (and\nparticularly sudden and\nsignificant changes) can be\nexpected to cause some\nfluctuations in the net asset\nvalue of the Underlying Fund to\nthe extent that it invests in\nfloating rate debt securities.\nThe historically low interest\nrate environment in recent years\nheightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates.\nCredit Risk . Debt issuers and\nother counterparties may be\nunable or unwilling to make\ntimely interest and/or principal\npayments when due or otherwise\nhonor their obligations. Changes\nin an issuer\u2019s credit rating or\nthe market\u2019s perception of an\nissuer\u2019s creditworthiness may\nalso adversely affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investment in that\nissuer. The degree of credit risk\ndepends on an issuer's or\ncounterparty's financial\ncondition and on the terms of an\nobligation. Investment in\nUnderlying Funds Risk. The Fund\nexpects to invest substantially\nall of its assets in the\nUnderlying Funds, so the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment performance is likely\nto be directly related to the\nperformance of the Underlying\nFunds. The Fund\u2019s NAV will change\nwith changes in the value of the\nUnderlying Funds and other\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests based on their market\nvaluations. An investment in the\nFund will entail more costs and\nexpenses than a direct investment\nin the Underlying Funds. As the\nUnderlying Funds, or the Fund\u2019s\nallocations among the Underlying\nFunds, change from time to time,\nor to the extent that the total\nannual fund operating expenses of\nany Underlying Fund change, the\nweighted average operating\nexpenses borne by the Fund may\nincrease or decrease. Through its\ninvestment in Underlying Funds,\nthe Fund may be exposed to\nManagement Risk, Market Risk,\nMarket Trading Risk, Passive\nInvestment Risk, and Tracking\nError Risk . Market Risk . The\nFund and the Underlying Funds\ncould lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market\nmovements and over longer periods\nduring more prolonged market\ndownturns. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts\nof terrorism, public health\nissues, recessions, the prospect\nor occurrence of a sovereign\ndefault or other financial\ncrisis, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the\nFund, the Underlying Funds and\ntheir investments and could\nresult in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s or\nUnderlying Fund's NAV. Index-\nRelated Risk. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\ndisruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an\nadverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nability to adjust its exposure to\nthe required levels in order to\ntrack the Underlying Index.\nErrors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction\nof the Underlying Index in\naccordance with its methodology\nmay occur from time to time and\nmay not be identified and\ncorrected by the Index Provider\nfor S-5 a period of time or at\nall, which may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural\ndisasters, political unrest or\nwar) may impact the Index\nProvider or a third-party data\nprovider, and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Affiliated Fund\nRisk. In managing the Fund, BFA\nhas the ability to select\nUnderlying Funds and substitute\nother ETFs consistent with the\nsector allocations of the\nUnderlying Index which it\nbelieves will achieve the Fund\u2019s\nobjective. BFA may be subject to\npotential conflicts of interest\nin selecting Underlying Funds and\nsubstituting other ETFs because\nthe fees paid to BFA by some\nUnderlying Funds and other ETFs\nmanaged by BFA may be higher than\nthe fees paid by other Underlying\nFunds. This risk may be reduced\nto the extent BFA has agreed to\nwaive Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses with respect to an\nUnderlying Fund. If an Underlying\nFund or other ETF holds interests\nin an affiliated fund in excess\nof a certain amount, the Fund may\nbe prohibited from purchasing\nshares of that Underlying Fund or\nother ETF. Allocation Risk. The\nFund\u2019s ability to achieve its\ninvestment objective depends upon\nthe Index Provider's ability to\ndevelop a model that accurately\nassesses the Fund\u2019s asset class\nallocation and selects the best\nmix of Underlying Funds and other\nETFs. There is a risk that the\nIndex Provider's evaluations and\nassumptions regarding asset\nclasses or Underlying Funds,\nwhich are utilized as inputs in\nthe model, may be incorrect in\nview of actual market conditions.\nAsset Class Risk. Securities and\nother assets in the Underlying\nIndex or in the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's portfolio may\nunderperform in comparison to the\ngeneral financial markets, a\nparticular financial market or\nother asset classes. Authorized\nParticipant Concentration Risk.\nOnly an Authorized Participant\n(as defined in the Creations and\nRedemptions section of this\nprospectus (the \u201c Prospectus \u201d ))\nmay engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly\nwith the Fund, and none of those\nAuthorized Participants is\nobligated to engage in creation\nand/or redemption transactions.\nThe Fund has a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants on an\nagency basis ( i.e., on behalf of\nother market participants). To\nthe extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or\nare unable to proceed with\ncreation or redemption orders\nwith respect to the Fund and no\nother Authorized Participant is\nable to step forward to create or\nredeem, Fund shares may be more\nlikely to trade at a premium or\ndiscount to NAV and possibly face\ntrading halts or delisting.\nAuthorized Participant\nconcentration risk may be\nheightened for ETFs, such as the\nFund, that invest in securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers or\nother securities or instruments\nthat have lower trading volumes.\nCalculation Methodology Risk. The\nIndex Provider relies on various\nsources of information to assess\nthe criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s calculation S-6\nmethodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an\naccurate assessment of included\ncomponents. Call Risk . During\nperiods of falling interest\nrates, an issuer of a callable\nbond held by the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may \u201c call \u201d or\nrepay the security before its\nstated maturity, and the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund may have to\nreinvest the proceeds in\nsecurities with lower yields,\nwhich would result in a decline\nin the Fund's income, or in\nsecurities with greater risks or\nwith other less favorable\nfeatures. Concentration Risk. The\nFund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund's or\nan Underlying Fund's investments\nare concentrated in the\nsecurities and/or other assets of\na particular issuer or issuers,\ncountry, group of countries,\nregion, market, industry, group\nof industries, sector, market\nsegment or asset class.\nCybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds, the Fund's or\nan Underlying Fund's adviser,\ndistributor, the Index Provider\nand other service providers,\nmarket makers, Authorized\nParticipants or the issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund invests have\nthe ability to cause disruptions,\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s\nbusiness operations and/or\npotentially result in financial\nlosses to the Fund and its\nshareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans and risk management systems\nseeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are\ninherent limitations in such\nplans and systems. Furthermore,\nthe Fund cannot control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems\nof the Fund\u2019s Index Provider and\nother service providers, market\nmakers, Authorized Participants\nor issuers of securities in which\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund\ninvests. Extension Risk. During\nperiods of rising interest rates,\ncertain debt obligations may be\npaid off substantially more\nslowly than originally\nanticipated and the value of\nthose securities may fall\nsharply, resulting in a decline\nin the Fund\u2019s or the Underlying\nFunds' income and potentially in\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's investments.\nFinancials Sector Risk . The\nperformance of companies in the\nfinancials sector may be\nadversely impacted by many\nfactors, including, among others,\nchanges in government\nregulations, economic conditions,\nand interest rates, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public\nperception, exposure\nconcentration and decreased\nliquidity in credit markets. The\nimpact of changes in regulation\nof any individual financial\ncompany, or of the financials\nsector as a whole, cannot be\npredicted. Cybersecurity\nincidents and technology\nmalfunctions and failures have\nbecome increasingly frequent and\nhave caused significant losses to\ncompanies in this sector, which\nmay negatively impact an\nUnderlying Fund. Geographic Risk\n. A natural disaster could occur\nin a geographic region in which\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund\ninvests, which could adversely\naffect the economy or the\nbusiness operations of companies\nin the specific geographic\nregion, causing an adverse impact\non the Fund's investments in, or\nwhich are exposed to, the\naffected region. High Portfolio\nTurnover Risk. High portfolio\nturnover (considered by the S-7\nFund and the Underlying Funds to\nmean higher than 100% annually)\nmay result in increased\ntransaction costs to the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund, including\nbrokerage commissions, dealer\nmark-ups and other transaction\ncosts on the sale of the\nsecurities and on reinvestment in\nother securities. High Yield\nSecurities Risk. Securities that\nare rated below investment-grade\n(commonly referred to as \u201c junk\nbonds, \u201d which may include those\nbonds rated below \u201c BBB- \u201d by S&P\nGlobal Ratings and Fitch Ratings,\nInc. ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ) or below \u201c\nBaa3 \u201d by Moody's Investors\nService, Inc. ( \u201c Moody's \u201d )),\nor are unrated, may be deemed\nspeculative, may involve greater\nlevels of risk than higher-rated\nsecurities of similar maturity\nand may be more likely to\ndefault. Illiquid Investments\nRisk . The Fund may not acquire\nany illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have\ninvested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments.\nAn illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that the Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold\nor disposed of in current market\nconditions in seven calendar days\nor less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the\ninvestment. To the extent the\nFund holds illiquid investments,\nthe illiquid investments may\nreduce the returns of the Fund\nbecause the Fund may be unable to\ntransact at advantageous times or\nprices. In addition, if the Fund\nis limited in its ability to sell\nilliquid investments during\nperiods when shareholders are\nredeeming their shares, the Fund\nwill need to sell liquid\nsecurities to meet redemption\nrequests and illiquid securities\nwill become a larger portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings. During\nperiods of market volatility,\nliquidity in the market for the\nFund\u2019s shares may be impacted by\nthe liquidity in the market for\nthe underlying securities or\ninstruments held by the Fund,\nwhich could lead to the Fund\u2019s\nshares trading at a premium or\ndiscount to the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nIncome Risk. The Fund's income\nmay decline due to a decline in\ninflation, deflation or changes\nin inflation expectations.\nIndexing Investment Risk . The\nFund and the Underlying Funds are\nnot actively managed, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to\ntake defensive positions under\nany market conditions, including\ndeclining markets. Infectious\nIllness Risk. A widespread\noutbreak of an infectious\nillness, such as the COVID-19\npandemic, may result in travel\nrestrictions, disruption of\nhealthcare services, prolonged\nquarantines, cancellations,\nsupply chain disruptions,\nbusiness closures, lower consumer\ndemand, layoffs, ratings\ndowngrades, defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and\npolitical impacts. Markets may\nexperience temporary closures,\nextreme volatility, severe\nlosses, reduced liquidity and\nincreased trading costs. Such\nevents may adversely affect the\nFund and its investments and may\nimpact the Fund\u2019s ability to\npurchase or sell securities or\ncause elevated tracking error and\nincreased premiums or discounts\nto the Fund's NAV. Despite the\ndevelopment of vaccines, the\nduration of the COVID-19 pandemic\nand its effects cannot be\npredicted with certainty. Issuer\nRisk . The performance of the\nFund depends on the performance\nof individual securities to which\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund\nhas exposure. The Fund may be\nadversely affected if an issuer\nof underlying securities held S-8\nby the Fund or an Underlying Fund\nis unable or unwilling to repay\nprincipal or interest when due.\nChanges in the financial\ncondition or credit rating of an\nissuer of those securities may\ncause the value of the securities\nto decline. Management Risk . As\nthe Fund will not fully replicate\nthe Underlying Index, it is\nsubject to the risk that BFA's\ninvestment strategy may not\nproduce the intended results. The\nFund is also subject to the risk\nthat the investment strategy of\nan Underlying Fund may not\nproduce the intended results.\nMarket Trading Risk . The Fund\nand the Underlying Funds face\nnumerous market trading risks,\nincluding the potential lack of\nan active market for their\nshares, losses from trading in\nsecondary markets, periods of\nhigh volatility and disruptions\nin the creation/redemption\nprocess. ANY OF THESE FACTORS,\nAMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE\nFUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S\nSHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR\nDISCOUNT TO NAV . Model Risk .\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the\nUnderlying Index's allocation\nmodel will achieve its intended\nresults or maximize returns or\nminimize risk, or be appropriate\nfor every investor seeking a\nparticular risk profile. Non-U.S.\nIssuers Risk. Securities issued\nby non-U.S. issuers carry\ndifferent risks from securities\nissued by U.S. issuers. These\nrisks include differences in\naccounting, auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards,\nthe possibility of expropriation\nor confiscatory taxation, adverse\nchanges in investment or exchange\ncontrol regulations, political\ninstability, regulatory and\neconomic differences, and\npotential restrictions on the\nflow of international capital.\nOperational Risk . The Fund and\nthe Underlying Funds are exposed\nto operational risks arising from\na number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s or\neach Underlying Fund's service\nproviders, counterparties or\nother third parties, failed or\ninadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures.\nThe Fund, the Underlying Funds\nand BFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Privately\nIssued Securities Risk. The Fund\nor Underlying Funds may invest in\nprivately issued securities,\nincluding those that are normally\npurchased pursuant to Rule 144A\nor Regulation S promulgated under\nthe Securities Act of 1933, as\namended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ).\nPrivately issued securities are\nsecurities that have not been\nregistered under the 1933 Act and\nas a result may be subject to\nlegal restrictions on resale.\nPrivately issued securities are\ngenerally not traded on\nestablished markets. As a result\nof the absence of a public\ntrading market, privately issued\nsecurities may be deemed to be\nilliquid investments, may be more\ndifficult to value than publicly\ntraded securities and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in\nvalue. Delay or difficulty in\nselling such securities may\nresult in a loss to the Fund.\nReinvestment Risk . The Fund or\nan Underlying Fund may invest a\nportion of its assets in short-\nterm fixed-income instruments\nand, as a result, may be S-9\nadversely affected if interest\nrates fall because they may have\nto invest in lower-yielding bonds\nas bonds in the Underlying Index\nare substituted. Risk of\nInvesting in China . Investments\nin bonds of Chinese issuers\n(including variable interest\nentities associated with an\nunderlying Chinese operating\ncompany) subject the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds to risks\nspecific to China. China may be\nsubject to considerable degrees\nof economic, political and social\ninstability. China is an emerging\nmarket and demonstrates\nsignificantly higher volatility\nfrom time to time in comparison\nto developed markets. Over the\nlast few decades, the Chinese\ngovernment has undertaken reform\nof economic and market practices\nand has expanded the sphere of\nprivate ownership of property in\nChina. However, Chinese markets\ngenerally continue to experience\ninefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies resulting from\ngovernmental influence, a lack of\npublicly available information\nand/or political and social\ninstability. Chinese issuers are\nalso subject to the risk that\nChinese authorities can intervene\nin their operations and\nstructure. Internal social unrest\nor confrontations with\nneighboring countries, including\nmilitary conflicts in response to\nsuch events, may also disrupt\neconomic development in China and\nresult in a greater risk of\ncurrency fluctuations, currency\nnon-convertibility, interest rate\nfluctuations and higher rates of\ninflation. China has experienced\nsecurity concerns, such as\nterrorism and strained\ninternational relations.\nAdditionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against\nforeign companies and foreign\ngovernments. Actual and\nthreatened responses to such\nactivity and strained\ninternational relations,\nincluding purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs\nor cyberattacks on the Chinese\ngovernment or Chinese companies,\nmay impact China\u2019s economy and\nChinese issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests. Incidents\ninvolving China's or the region's\nsecurity may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely\naffect the Chinese economy and\nthe Fund's investments. Export\ngrowth continues to be a major\ndriver of China's rapid economic\ngrowth. Reduction in spending on\nChinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification,\ninstitution of additional tariffs\nor other trade barriers\n(including as a result of\nheightened trade tensions or a\ntrade war between China and the\nU.S. or in response to actual or\nalleged Chinese cyber activity)\nor a downturn in any of the\neconomies of China's key trading\npartners may have an adverse\nimpact on the Chinese economy.\nThe Underlying Index may include\ncompanies that are subject to\neconomic or trade restrictions\n(but not investment restrictions)\nimposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national\nsecurity, human rights or other\nconcerns of such government. So\nlong as these restrictions do not\ninclude restrictions on\ninvestments, the Fund is\ngenerally expected to invest in\nsuch companies, consistent with\nits objective to track the\nperformance of the Underlying\nIndex. Chinese issuers are not\nsubject to the same degree of\nregulatory requirements,\naccounting standards or auditor\noversight as issuers in more\ndeveloped countries. As a result,\nS-10 information about the\nChinese securities in which the\nFund invests may be less reliable\nor complete. There may be\nsignificant obstacles to\nobtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or\nlitigation against Chinese\nissuers, and investors may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund\nis not actively managed and does\nnot select investments based on\ninvestor protection\nconsiderations. Risk of Investing\nin Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s and the Underlying Fund's\ninvestment in developed country\nissuers will subject the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with\ndeveloped countries. Developed\ncountries tend to represent a\nsignificant portion of the global\neconomy and have generally\nexperienced slower economic\ngrowth than some less developed\ncountries. Certain developed\ncountries have experienced\nsecurity concerns, such as war,\nterrorism and strained\ninternational relations.\nIncidents involving a country\u2019s\nor region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and\nmay adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying\nFund's investments. In addition,\ndeveloped countries may be\nadversely impacted by changes to\nthe economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens\nand the price or availability of\ncertain commodities. Risk of\nInvesting in Saudi Arabia . The\nability of foreign investors\n(such as the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund) to invest in the\nsecurities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers is relatively new. Such\nability could be restricted by\nthe Saudi Arabian government at\nany time, and unforeseen risks\ncould materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership in such\nsecurities. The economy of Saudi\nArabia is dominated by petroleum\nexports. A sustained decrease in\npetroleum prices could have a\nnegative impact on all aspects of\nthe economy. Investments in the\nsecurities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers involve risks not\ntypically associated with\ninvestments in securities of\nissuers in more developed\ncountries that may negatively\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s or\nUnderlying Fund's investments.\nSuch heightened risks may\ninclude, among others,\nexpropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets,\nrestrictions on and government\nintervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation,\npolitical instability, including\nauthoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental\ndecision making, armed conflict,\ncrime and instability as a result\nof religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. There\nremains the possibility that\ninstability in the larger Middle\nEast region could adversely\nimpact the economy of Saudi\nArabia, and there is no assurance\nof political stability in Saudi\nArabia. Risk of Investing in the\nU.S . Certain changes in the U.S.\neconomy, such as when the U.S.\neconomy weakens or when its\nfinancial markets decline, may\nhave an adverse effect on the\nsecurities to which the Fund or\nthe Underlying Funds have\nexposure. Securities Lending\nRisk. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund may engage in securities\nlending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund\nor the Underlying Funds may lose\nmoney because the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return\nthe securities in a timely manner\nor at all. The Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline\nin the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned S-11\nsecurities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse\ntax consequences for the Fund.\nTracking Error Risk . The Fund\nand the Underlying Funds may be\nsubject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d\nwhich is the divergence of the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\nperformance from that of the\napplicable underlying index.\nTracking error may occur because\nof differences between the\nsecurities and other instruments\nheld in the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's portfolio and\nthose included in the applicable\nunderlying index, pricing\ndifferences (including, as\napplicable, differences between a\nsecurity\u2019s price at the local\nmarket close and the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's valuation of a\nsecurity at the time of\ncalculation of the Fund's or\nUnderlying Fund's NAV,\nrespectively), transaction costs\nincurred by the Fund, the Fund\u2019s\nor an Underlying Fund's holding\nof uninvested cash, differences\nin timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of distributions, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-\nthrough tax treatment, portfolio\ntransactions carried out to\nminimize the distribution of\ncapital gains to shareholders,\nacceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the applicable\nunderlying index or the costs to\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund of\ncomplying with various new or\nexisting regulatory requirements,\namong other reasons. This risk\nmay be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund or an Underlying\nFund incurs fees and expenses,\nwhile the applicable underlying\nindex does not. Valuation Risk .\nThe price the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund could receive\nupon the sale of a security or\nother asset may differ from the\nFund's or the Underlying Fund's\nvaluation of the security,\ninstrument or other asset and\nfrom the value used by its\nunderlying index, particularly\nfor securities or other assets\nthat trade in low volume or\nvolatile markets or that are\nvalued using a fair value\nmethodology as a result of trade\nsuspensions or for other reasons.\nIn addition, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in the\nFund's or an Underlying Fund's\nportfolio may change on days or\nduring time periods when\nshareholders will not be able to\npurchase or sell the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's shares.\nAuthorized Participants who\npurchase or redeem Fund shares on\ndays when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or\nlower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities not\nbeen fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology.\nThe ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological\nissues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party\nservice providers. S-12\n\nPerformance Information The bar\nchart and table that follow show\nhow the Fund has performed on a\ncalendar year basis and provide\nsome indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing\nhow the Fund\u2019s average annual\nreturns for 1 and 5 years and\nsince inception compare with the\nUnderlying Index.Both assume that\nall dividends and distributions\nhave been reinvested in the Fund.\nPast performance (before and\nafter taxes) does not necessarily\nindicate how the Fund will\nperform in the future.If BFA had\nnot waived certain Fund fees\nduring certain periods, the\nFund's returns would have been\nlower.

Fund\nreturns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund\nshares are calculated assuming\nthat an investor has sufficient\ncapital gains of the same\ncharacter from other investments\nto offset any capital losses from\nthe sale of Fund shares. As a\nresult, Fund returns after taxes\non distributions and sales of\nFund shares may exceed Fund\nreturns before taxes and/or\nreturns after taxes on\ndistributions.\n\nS-13\n\nManagement Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer\nHsui, Greg Savage and Paul\nWhitehead (the \u201c Portfolio\nManagers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. Each\nPortfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms.\nHsui, Mr. Savage and Mr.\nWhitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2022.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares\nThe Fund is an ETF. Individual\nshares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (a premium) or\nless than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs\nattributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase\nshares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling\nshares in the secondary market\n(the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to\nmake distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income\nor capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan\nor an IRA, in which case, your\ndistributions generally will be\ntaxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you\npurchase shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a\nbank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing\nactivities and presentations,\neducational training programs,\nconferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and\nreporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the\nbroker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson\nto recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your\nfinancial intermediary\u2019s website\nfor more information. S-14 More\nInformation About the Fund This\nProspectus contains important\ninformation about investing in\nthe Fund. Please read this\nProspectus carefully before you\nmake any investment decisions.\nAdditional information regarding\nthe Fund is available at\nwww.iShares.com. BFA is the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund.\nShares of the Fund are listed for\ntrading on NYSE Arca, Inc. ( \u201c\nNYSE Arca \u201d ). The market price\nfor a share of the Fund may be\ndifferent from the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. ETFs are funds that\ntrade like other publicly traded\nsecurities. The Fund is designed\nto track an index. Similar to\nshares of an index mutual fund,\neach share of the Fund represents\nan ownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of\nsecurities and other instruments\nintended to track a market index.\nUnlike shares of a mutual fund,\nwhich can be bought and redeemed\nfrom the issuing fund by all\nshareholders at a price based on\nNAV, shares of the Fund may be\npurchased or redeemed directly\nfrom the Fund at NAV solely by\nAuthorized Participants and only\nin aggregations of a specified\nnumber of shares ( \u201c Creation\nUnits \u201d ). Also unlike shares of\na mutual fund, shares of the Fund\nare listed on a national\nsecurities exchange and trade in\nthe secondary market at market\nprices that change throughout the\nday. An index is a financial\ncalculation, based on a grouping\nof financial instruments, and is\nnot an investment product, while\nthe Fund is an actual investment\nportfolio. The performance of the\nFund and the Underlying Index may\nvary for a number of reasons,\nincluding transaction costs,\nnon-U.S. currency valuations,\nasset valuations, corporate\nactions (such as mergers and\nspin-offs), timing variances and\ndifferences between the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and the Underlying\nIndex resulting from the Fund's\nor Underlying Fund's use of\nrepresentative sampling or from\nlegal restrictions (such as\ndiversification requirements)\nthat apply to the Fund but not to\nthe Underlying Index. From time\nto time, the Index Provider may\nmake changes to the methodology\nor other adjustments to the\nUnderlying Index. Unless\notherwise determined by BFA, any\nsuch change or adjustment will be\nreflected in the calculation of\nthe Underlying Index performance\non a going-forward basis after\nthe effective date of such change\nor adjustment. Therefore, the\nUnderlying Index performance\nshown for periods prior to the\neffective date of any such change\nor adjustment will generally not\nbe recalculated or restated to\nreflect such change or\nadjustment. \u201c Tracking error \u201d is\nthe divergence of the Fund's\nperformance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. To the extent\nthat the Fund uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy, it can be expected to\nhave a larger tracking error than\nif it used a replication indexing\nstrategy. \u201c Replication \u201d is an\nindexing strategy in which a fund\ninvests in substantially all of\nthe securities in its underlying\nindex in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying\nindex. An investment in the Fund\nis not a bank deposit and it is\nnot insured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other\ngovernment agency, BFA or any of\nits affiliates. 1 The Fund's\ninvestment objective and the\nUnderlying Index may be changed\nwithout shareholder approval. A\nFurther Discussion of Principal\nRisks The Fund is subject to\nvarious risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s NAV, trading price, yield,\ntotal return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. The\nFund may be exposed to these\nrisks directly or indirectly\nthrough the Fund's investments in\nthe Underlying Funds. You could\nlose all or part of your\ninvestment in the Fund, and the\nFund could underperform other\ninvestments. The order of the\nbelow risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. The Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com.\nAffiliated Fund Risk. In managing\nthe Fund, BFA has the ability to\nselect Underlying Funds and\nsubstitute other ETFs consistent\nwith the sector allocations of\nthe Underlying Index which it\nbelieves will achieve the Fund\u2019s\nobjective. BFA may be subject to\npotential conflicts of interest\nin selecting Underlying Funds and\nsubstituting other ETFs because\nthe fees paid to BFA by some\nUnderlying Funds and other ETFs\nmanaged by BFA may be higher than\nthe fees paid by other Underlying\nFunds. This risk may be reduced\nto the extent BFA has agreed to\nwaive Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses with respect to an\nUnderlying Fund. If an Underlying\nFund or other ETF holds interests\nin an affiliated fund, the Fund\nmay be prohibited from purchasing\nshares of that Underlying Fund or\nother ETF. Allocation Risk. The\nFund\u2019s ability to achieve its\ninvestment objective depends upon\nthe Index Provider\u2019s ability to\ndevelop a model that accurately\nassesses the Fund\u2019s asset class\nallocation and selects the best\nmix of Underlying Funds and other\nETFs. There is a risk that the\nIndex Provider\u2019s evaluations and\nassumptions regarding asset\nclasses or Underlying Funds,\nwhich are utilized as inputs in\nthe model, may be incorrect in\nview of actual market conditions.\nThe Fund\u2019s Underlying Index may\noverweight certain asset classes\nrelative to market\ncapitalization-weighted\nbenchmarks. The Fund will\nunderperform such benchmarks when\nasset classes that are\noverweighted in the Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index underperform\nother asset classes. Asset Class\nRisk. The securities and other\nassets in the Underlying Index or\nin the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying\nFund's portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to other securities\nor indexes that track other\ncountries, groups of countries,\nregions, industries, groups of\nindustries, markets, market\nsegments, asset classes or\nsectors. Various types of\nsecurities, currencies and\nindexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and\nunderperformance in comparison to\nthe general financial markets\ndepending upon a number of\nfactors including, among other\nthings, inflation, interest\nrates, productivity, global\ndemand for local products or\nresources, and regulation and\ngovernmental controls. This may\ncause the Fund to underperform\nother investment vehicles that\ninvest in different asset\nclasses. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund, and none of those\nAuthorized Participants is\nobligated to engage in creation\nand/or redemption transactions.\nThe Fund has a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as\nAuthorized 2 Participants on an\nagency basis ( i.e. , on behalf\nof other market participants). To\nthe extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or\nare unable to proceed with\ncreation or redemption orders\nwith respect to the Fund and no\nother Authorized Participant is\nable to step forward to create or\nredeem Creation Units, Fund\nshares may be more likely to\ntrade at a premium or discount to\nNAV and possibly face trading\nhalts or delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk\nmay be heightened because ETFs,\nsuch as the Fund, that invest in\nsecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers or other securities or\ninstruments that are less widely\ntraded often involve greater\nsettlement and operational issues\nand capital costs for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the\navailability of Authorized\nParticipants. Calculation\nMethodology Risk. The Index\nProvider relies on various\nsources of information to assess\nthe criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index\nProvider's calculation\nmethodology or sources of\ninformation will provide an\naccurate assessment of included\ncomponents. Call Risk. During\nperiods of falling interest\nrates, an issuer of a callable\nbond held by the Fund and an\nUnderlying Fund may \u201c call \u201d or\nrepay the security before its\nstated maturity, and the Fund and\nan Underlying Fund may have to\nreinvest the proceeds in\nsecurities with lower yields,\nwhich would result in a decline\nin the Fund\u2019s income, or in\nsecurities with greater risks or\nwith other less favorable\nfeatures. Concentration Risk. The\nFund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund's or\nan Underlying Fund's investments\nare concentrated in the\nsecurities and/or other assets of\na particular issuer or issuers,\ncountry, group of countries,\nregion, market, industry, group\nof industries, project types,\ngroup of project types, sector,\nmarket segment or asset class.\nThe Fund may be more adversely\naffected by the underperformance\nof those securities and/or other\nassets, may experience increased\nprice volatility and may be more\nsusceptible to adverse economic,\nmarket, political or regulatory\noccurrences affecting those\nsecurities and/or other assets\nthan a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments.\nCredit Risk. Credit risk is the\nrisk that the issuer or guarantor\nof a debt instrument or the\ncounterparty to a derivatives\ncontract, repurchase agreement or\nloan of portfolio securities will\nbe unable or unwilling to make\nits timely interest and/or\nprincipal payments when due or\notherwise honor its obligations.\nThere are varying degrees of\ncredit risk, depending on an\nissuer\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s\nfinancial condition and on the\nterms of an obligation, which may\nbe reflected in the issuer\u2019s or\ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating.\nThere is the chance that the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\nportfolio holdings will have\ntheir credit ratings downgraded\nor will default ( i.e., fail to\nmake scheduled interest or\nprincipal payments), or that the\nmarket\u2019s perception of an\nissuer\u2019s creditworthiness may\nworsen, potentially reducing the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\nincome level or share price.\nCybersecurity Risk. The Fund, the\nUnderlying Funds, Authorized\nParticipants, service providers\nand the relevant listing exchange\nare susceptible to operational,\ninformation security and related\n\u201c cyber \u201d risks both directly and\nthrough their service providers.\n3 Similar types of cybersecurity\nrisks are also present for\nissuers of securities in which\nthe Fund or the Underlying Funds\ninvest, which could result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for\nsuch issuers and may cause the\nFund\u2019s or the Underlying Funds'\ninvestment in such issuers to\nlose value. In general, cyber\nincidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or\nunintentional events. Cyber\nincidents include, but are not\nlimited to, gaining unauthorized\naccess to digital systems ( e.g.\n, through \u201c hacking \u201d or\nmalicious software coding) for\npurposes of misappropriating\nassets or sensitive information,\ncorrupting data, or causing\noperational disruption.\nCyberattacks may also be carried\nout in a manner that does not\nrequire gaining unauthorized\naccess, such as causing denial-\nof-service attacks on websites (\ni.e. , efforts to make network\nservices unavailable to intended\nusers). Geopolitical tensions may\nincrease the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate\nattacks, particularly those from\nnation-states or from entities\nwith nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity failures by, or\nbreaches of, the systems of the\nFund's or the Underlying Funds'\nadviser, distributor and other\nservice providers (including, but\nnot limited to, index and\nbenchmark providers, fund\naccountants, custodians, transfer\nagents and administrators),\nmarket makers, Authorized\nParticipants or the issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund or\nthe Underlying Funds invest have\nthe ability to cause disruptions\nand impact business operations,\npotentially resulting in:\nfinancial losses, interference\nwith the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying\nFund's ability to calculate its\nNAV, disclosure of confidential\ntrading information, impediments\nto trading, submission of\nerroneous trades or erroneous\ncreation or redemption orders,\nthe inability of the Fund, the\nUnderlying Funds or their service\nproviders to transact business,\nviolations of applicable privacy\nand other laws, regulatory fines,\npenalties, reputational damage,\nreimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, or additional\ncompliance costs. In addition,\ncyberattacks may render records\nof Fund assets and transactions,\nshareholder ownership of Fund\nshares, and other data integral\nto the functioning of the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund inaccessible,\ninaccurate or incomplete.\nSubstantial costs may be incurred\nby the Fund or an Underlying Fund\nin order to resolve or prevent\ncyber incidents. While the Fund\nand the Underlying Funds have\nestablished business continuity\nplans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent,\nsuch cyber incidents, there are\ninherent limitations in such\nplans and systems, including the\npossibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that\nprevention and remediation\nefforts will not be successful or\nthat cyberattacks will go\nundetected. Furthermore, the Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems put in place by\nservice providers to the Fund,\nissuers in which the Fund\ninvests, the Index Provider,\nmarket makers or Authorized\nParticipants. The Fund and its\nshareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. Extension\nRisk. During periods of rising\ninterest rates, certain debt\nobligations may be paid off\nsubstantially more slowly than\noriginally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may\nfall sharply, resulting in a\ndecline in the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's income and\npotentially in the value of the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestments. Financials Sector\nRisk. Companies in the financials\nsector are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation and\nintervention, which may adversely\naffect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and\nliquid assets they 4 must\nmaintain and, potentially, their\nsize. Governmental regulation may\nchange frequently and may have\nsignificant adverse consequences\nfor companies in the financials\nsector, including effects not\nintended by such regulation.\nIncreased risk taking by\nfinancial companies may also\nresult in greater overall risk in\nthe U.S. and global financials\nsector. The impact of changes in\ncapital requirements, or recent\nor future regulation in various\ncountries, on any individual\nfinancial company or on the\nfinancials sector as a whole\ncannot be predicted. Certain\nrisks may impact the value of\ninvestments in the financials\nsector more severely than those\nof investments outside this\nsector, including the risks\nassociated with companies that\noperate with substantial\nfinancial leverage. Companies in\nthe financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of\ntheir borrowers and\ncounterparties, who may be\nleveraged to an unknown degree,\nincluding through swaps and other\nderivatives products. Financial\nservices companies may have\nsignificant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties,\nwith the result that a borrower\u2019s\nor counterparty\u2019s inability to\nmeet its obligations to one\ncompany may affect other\ncompanies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty.\nThis interconnectedness of risk\nmay result in significant\nnegative impacts to companies\nwith direct exposure to the\ndefaulting counterparty as well\nas adverse cascading effects in\nthe markets and the financials\nsector generally. Companies in\nthe financials sector may also be\nadversely affected by increases\nin interest rates and loan\nlosses, decreases in the\navailability of money or asset\nvaluations, credit rating\ndowngrades, adverse public\nperception and adverse conditions\nin other related markets.\nInsurance companies, in\nparticular, may be subject to\nsevere price competition and/or\nrate regulation, which may have\nan adverse impact on their\nprofitability. The financials\nsector is particularly sensitive\nto fluctuations in interest\nrates. The financials sector is\nalso a target for cyberattacks.\nCybersecurity incidents and\ntechnology malfunctions and\nfailures have become increasingly\nfrequent and have caused\nsignificant losses to companies\nin this sector, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund. The\nextent to which the Fund may\ninvest in a company that engages\nin securities-related activities\nor banking is limited by\napplicable law. Geographic Risk.\nSome of the companies in which\nthe Fund or Underlying Funds\ninvest are located in parts of\nthe world that have historically\nbeen prone to natural disasters\nsuch as earthquakes, volcanic\neruptions, droughts, floods,\nhurricanes or tsunamis and are\neconomically sensitive to\nenvironmental events. Any such\nevent may adversely impact the\neconomies of these geographic\nareas or business operations of\ncompanies in these geographic\nareas, causing an adverse impact\non the value of the Fund. High\nPortfolio Turnover Risk. High\nportfolio turnover (considered by\nthe Fund and the Underlying Funds\nto mean higher than 100%\nannually) may result in increased\ntransaction costs to the Fund,\nincluding brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and other\ntransaction costs on the sale of\nthe securities and on\nreinvestment in other securities.\nThese effects of higher than\nnormal portfolio turnover may\nadversely affect Fund or\nUnderlying Fund performance. High\nYield Securities Risk. Securities\nthat are rated below investment-\ngrade (commonly referred to as \u201c\njunk bonds, \u201d which may include\nthose bonds rated below 5 \u201c BBB-\n\u201d by S&P Global Ratings and\nFitch, or below \u201c Baa3 \u201d by\nMoody\u2019s), or are unrated, may be\ndeemed speculative, may involve\ngreater levels of risk than\nhigher-rated securities of\nsimilar maturity and may be more\nlikely to default. The major\nrisks of high yield securities\ninvestments include: \u25a0 High yield\nsecurities may be issued by less\ncreditworthy issuers. Issuers of\nhigh yield securities may have a\nlarger amount of outstanding debt\nrelative to their assets than\nissuers of investment-grade\nbonds. In the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy, claims of\nother creditors may have priority\nover the claims of high yield\nsecurities holders, leaving few\nor no assets available to repay\nhigh yield securities holders. \u25a0\nPrices of high yield securities\nare subject to extreme price\nfluctuations. Adverse changes in\nan issuer\u2019s industry and general\neconomic conditions may have a\ngreater impact on the prices of\nhigh yield securities than on\nother higher rated fixed-income\nsecurities. The credit rating of\na high yield security does not\nnecessarily address its market\nvalue risk. Ratings and market\nvalue may change from time to\ntime, positively or negatively,\nto reflect new developments\nregarding the issuer. \u25a0 Issuers\nof high yield securities may be\nunable to meet their interest or\nprincipal payment obligations\nbecause of an economic downturn,\nspecific issuer developments, or\nthe unavailability of additional\nfinancing. \u25a0 High yield\nsecurities frequently have\nredemption features that permit\nan issuer to repurchase the\nsecurity from the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund before it\nmatures. If the issuer redeems\nhigh yield securities held by the\nFund or an Underlying Fund, the\nFund or an Underlying Fund may\nhave to invest the proceeds in\nbonds with lower yields and may\nlose income. \u25a0 High yield\nsecurities may be less liquid\nthan higher rated fixed-income\nsecurities, even under normal\neconomic conditions. There are\nfewer dealers in the high yield\nsecurities market, and there may\nbe significant differences in the\nprices quoted for high yield\nsecurities by the dealers.\nBecause high yield securities may\nbe less liquid than higher rated\nfixed-income securities, judgment\nmay play a greater role in\nvaluing certain of the Fund's\nsecurities than is the case with\nsecurities trading in a more\nliquid market. \u25a0 The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may incur\nexpenses to the extent necessary\nto seek recovery upon default or\nto negotiate new terms with a\ndefaulting issuer. Illiquid\nInvestments Risk. The Fund may\nnot acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after\nthe acquisition, the Fund would\nhave invested more than 15% of\nits net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that\nthe Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in\nseven calendar days or less\nwithout significantly changing\nthe market value of the\ninvestment. Liquid investments\nmay become illiquid after\npurchase by the Fund,\nparticularly during periods of\nmarket turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or\ninstrument that is deemed to be\nliquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long\nas it is held by the Fund, and\nany security or instrument held\nby the Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to\nthe Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent\nthe Fund holds illiquid\ninvestments, the illiquid\ninvestments may reduce the\nreturns of the Fund because the\nFund may be unable to transact at\n6 advantageous times or prices.\nAn investment may be illiquid due\nto, among other things, the\nreduced number and capacity of\ntraditional market participants\nto make a market in securities or\ninstruments, the lack of an\nactive market for such securities\nor instruments, capital controls,\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof local currency, or insolvency\nof local governments. To the\nextent that the Fund invests in\nsecurities or instruments with\nsubstantial market and/or credit\nrisk, the Fund will tend to have\nincreased exposure to the risks\nassociated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid investments\nmay be harder to value,\nespecially in changing markets.\nAlthough the Fund primarily seeks\nto redeem shares of the Fund on\nan in-kind basis, if the Fund is\nforced to sell underlying\ninvestments at reduced prices or\nunder unfavorable conditions to\nmeet redemption requests or for\nother cash needs, the Fund may\nsuffer a loss. This may be\nmagnified in a rising interest\nrate environment or other\ncircumstances where redemptions\nfrom the Fund may be greater than\nnormal. Other market participants\nmay be attempting to liquidate\nholdings at the same time as the\nFund, causing increased supply of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying investments\nin the market and contributing to\nilliquid investments risk and\ndownward pricing pressure. In\naddition, if the Fund is limited\nin its ability to sell illiquid\ninvestments during periods when\nshareholders are redeeming their\nshares, the Fund will need to\nsell liquid securities to meet\nredemption requests and illiquid\nsecurities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings.\nDuring periods of market\nvolatility, liquidity in the\nmarket for the Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe impacted by the liquidity in\nthe market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by\nthe Fund, which could lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a\npremium or discount to the Fund's\nNAV. Income Risk. The Fund\u2019s\nincome may decline if interest\nrates fall. This decline in\nincome can occur because an\nUnderlying Fund may subsequently\ninvest in lower-yielding bonds as\nbonds in its portfolio mature,\nare near maturity or are called,\nor an Underlying Fund otherwise\nneeds to purchase additional\nbonds. Index-Related Risk. The\nFund seeks to achieve a return\nthat corresponds generally to the\nprice and yield performance,\nbefore fees and expenses, of the\nUnderlying Index as published by\nthe Index Provider. There is no\nassurance that the Index Provider\nor any agents that may act on its\nbehalf will compile the\nUnderlying Index accurately, or\nthat the Underlying Index will be\ndetermined, composed or\ncalculated accurately. While the\nIndex Provider provides\ndescriptions of what the\nUnderlying Index is designed to\nachieve, neither the Index\nProvider nor its agents provide\nany warranty or accept any\nliability in relation to the\nquality, accuracy or completeness\nof the Underlying Index or its\nrelated data, and they do not\nguarantee that the Underlying\nIndex will be in line with the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology.\nBFA\u2019s mandate as described in\nthis Prospectus is to manage the\nFund consistently with the\nUnderlying Index provided by the\nIndex Provider to BFA. BFA does\nnot provide any warranty or\nguarantee against the Index\nProvider\u2019s or any agent\u2019s errors.\nErrors in respect of the quality,\naccuracy and completeness of the\ndata used to compile the\nUnderlying Index may occur from\ntime to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of\ntime or at all, particularly\nwhere the indices are less\ncommonly used as benchmarks by\nfunds or managers. In addition,\nthere may be heightened risks\nassociated with the adequacy and\nreliability of the information\nthe Index Provider uses given the\nFund's exposure to emerging\nmarkets, as certain emerging\nmarkets may have less information\navailable or 7 less regulatory\noversight. Such errors may\nnegatively or positively impact\nthe Fund and its shareholders.\nFor example, during a period\nwhere the Underlying Index\ncontains incorrect constituents,\nthe Fund would have market\nexposure to such constituents and\nwould be underexposed to the\nUnderlying Index\u2019s other\nconstituents. Shareholders should\nunderstand that any gains from\nIndex Provider errors will be\nkept by the Fund and its\nshareholders and any losses or\ncosts resulting from Index\nProvider errors will be borne by\nthe Fund and its shareholders.\nUnusual market conditions or\nother unforeseen circumstances\n(such as natural disasters,\npolitical unrest or war) may\nimpact the Index Provider or a\nthird-party data provider, and\ncould cause the Index Provider to\npostpone a scheduled rebalance to\nthe Underlying Index. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. The postponement of\na scheduled rebalance could mean\nthat constituents of the\nUnderlying Index that would\notherwise be removed at rebalance\ndue to changes in market value,\nissuer credit ratings, or other\nreasons may remain, causing the\nperformance and constituents of\nthe Underlying Index to vary from\nthose expected under normal\nconditions. Apart from scheduled\nrebalances, the Index Provider or\nits agents may carry out\nadditional ad hoc rebalances to\nthe Underlying Index due to\nreaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market\nconditions or corporate events\nor, for example, to correct an\nerror in the selection of index\nconstituents. When the Underlying\nIndex is rebalanced and the Fund\nin turn rebalances its portfolio\nto attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and the Underlying\nIndex, any transaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising from such\nportfolio rebalancing will be\nborne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. Therefore,\nerrors and additional ad hoc\nrebalances carried out by the\nIndex Provider or its agents to\nthe Underlying Index may increase\nthe costs to and the tracking\nerror risk of the Fund. Similar\nrisks exist for the Underlying\nFunds in tracking their\nbenchmarks, which may result in\nthe Fund's performance deviating\nfrom the return of the Underlying\nIndex. Indexing Investment Risk.\nThe Fund and the Underlying Funds\nare not actively managed and may\nbe affected by a general decline\nin market segments related to\ntheir underlying indexes. The\nFund and Underlying Funds invest\nin securities included in, or\nrepresentative of, the applicable\nunderlying index, regardless of\ntheir investment merits. BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to\ninvest the Fund's assets in\ndefensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including\ndeclining markets. The Fund may\nalso be exposed to indexing\ninvestment risk through its\ninvestment in the Underlying\nFunds. Infectious Illness Risk. A\nwidespread outbreak of an\ninfectious illness, such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, may adversely\naffect the economies of many\nnations and the global economy\nand may impact individual issuers\nand capital markets in ways that\ncannot be foreseen. An infectious\nillness outbreak may result in\ntravel restrictions, closed\ninternational borders, disruption\nof healthcare services, prolonged\nquarantines, cancellations,\nsupply chain disruptions, lower\nconsumer demand, temporary and\npermanent closures of businesses,\nlayoffs, defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and\npolitical impacts, as well as\ngeneral concern and uncertainty.\n8 An infectious illness outbreak\nmay result in extreme volatility,\nsevere losses, credit\ndeterioration of issuers, and\ndisruptions in markets, which\ncould adversely impact the Fund\nand its investments, including\nimpairing any hedging activity.\nCertain local markets may be\nsubject to closures. Any\nsuspension of trading in markets\nin which the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund invests will have\nan impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments and will impact the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\nability to purchase or sell\nsecurities in such markets.\nMarket or economic disruptions\ncould result in elevated tracking\nerror and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund's NAV.\nAdditionally, an outbreak could\nimpair the operations of the\nFund\u2019s service providers,\nincluding BFA, which could\nadversely impact the Fund.\nGovernmental and quasi-\ngovernmental authorities and\nregulators throughout the world\nmay respond to an outbreak and\nany resulting economic\ndisruptions with a variety of\nfiscal and monetary policy\nchanges, including direct capital\ninfusions into companies and\nother issuers, new monetary\npolicy tools, and changes in\ninterest rates. A reversal of\nthese policies, or the\nineffectiveness of such policies,\nis likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments. An\noutbreak may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social\nand economic risks in certain\ncountries or globally, which\ncould adversely affect the Fund\nand its investments and could\nresult in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund's NAV.\nDespite the development of\nvaccines, the duration of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and its effects\ncannot be predicted with\ncertainty. Interest Rate Risk. If\ninterest rates rise, the value of\nfixed-income securities or other\ninstruments held by the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund would likely\ndecrease. A measure investors\ncommonly use to determine this\nprice sensitivity is called\nduration. Fixed-income securities\nwith longer durations tend to be\nmore sensitive to interest rate\nchanges, usually making their\nprices more volatile than those\nof securities with shorter\ndurations. For example, if a bond\nhas a duration of five years and\ninterest rates rise, the price of\nthe bond will likely decline by a\ngreater percentage than if the\nbond had a one year duration. To\nthe extent the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund invests a\nsubstantial portion of its assets\nin fixed-income securities with\nlonger duration, rising interest\nrates may cause the value of the\nFund's or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestments to decline\nsignificantly, which would\nadversely affect the value of the\nFund. An increase in interest\nrates may lead to heightened\nvolatility in the fixed-income\nmarkets and adversely affect\ncertain fixed-income investments,\nincluding those held by the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund. Because\nrates on certain floating rate\ndebt securities typically reset\nonly periodically, changes in\nprevailing interest rates (and\nparticularly sudden and\nsignificant changes) can be\nexpected to cause some\nfluctuations in the net asset\nvalue of the Underlying Fund to\nthe extent that it invests in\nfloating rate debt securities. In\naddition, decreases in fixed-\nincome dealer market-making\ncapacity may lead to lower\ntrading volume, heightened\nvolatility, wider bid-ask spreads\nand less transparent pricing in\ncertain fixed-income markets. The\nhistorically low interest rate\nenvironment in recent years was\ncreated in part by the world\u2019s\nmajor central banks keeping their\novernight policy interest rates\nat, near or below zero percent\nand implementing monetary policy\nfacilities, such as asset 9\npurchase programs, to anchor\nlonger-term interest rates below\nhistorical levels. During periods\nof very low or negative interest\nrates, the Fund may be unable to\nmaintain positive returns or pay\ndividends to Fund shareholders.\nCertain countries have recently\nexperienced negative interest\nrates on certain fixed-income\ninstruments. Very low or negative\ninterest rates may magnify\ninterest rate risk. Changing\ninterest rates, including rates\nthat fall below zero, may have\nunpredictable effects on markets,\nresult in heightened market\nvolatility and detract from the\nFund\u2019s performance to the extent\nthe Fund is exposed to such\ninterest rates. Additionally,\nunder certain market conditions\nin which interest rates are set\nat low levels and the market\nprices of portfolio securities\nhave increased, the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may have a very\nlow or even negative yield. A low\nor negative yield would cause the\nFund or an Underlying Fund to\nlose money in certain conditions\nand over certain time periods.\nCentral banks may increase their\nshort-term policy rates or begin\nphasing out, or \u201c tapering, \u201d\naccommodative monetary policy\nfacilities in the future. The\ntiming, coordination, magnitude\nand effect of such policy changes\non various markets are uncertain,\nand such changes in monetary\npolicy may adversely affect the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s investments.\nInvestment in Underlying Funds\nRisk. The Fund expects to invest\nsubstantially all of its assets\nin the Underlying Funds, so the\nFund\u2019s investment performance is\nlikely to be directly related to\nthe performance of the Underlying\nFunds. The Fund may also invest\nin other funds, including money\nmarket funds. The Fund\u2019s NAV will\nchange with changes in the value\nof the Underlying Funds and other\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests based on their market\nvaluations. An investment in the\nFund will entail more direct and\nindirect costs and expenses than\na direct investment in the\nUnderlying Funds. For example, in\naddition to the expenses of the\nFund, the Fund indirectly pays a\nportion of the expenses\n(including operating expenses and\nmanagement fees) incurred by the\nUnderlying Funds, although some\nof such fees will be offset by\nthe fee waiver by BFA. One\nUnderlying Fund may buy the same\nsecurities that another\nUnderlying Fund sells. Also, an\ninvestor in the Fund may receive\ntaxable gains from portfolio\ntransactions by the Underlying\nFunds, as well as taxable gains\nfrom transactions in shares of\nthe Underlying Funds by the Fund.\nAs the Underlying Funds, or the\nFund's allocations among the\nUnderlying Funds, change from\ntime to time, or to the extent\nthat the total annual fund\noperating expenses of the\nUnderlying Funds change, the\nweighted average operating\nexpenses borne by the Fund may\nincrease or decrease. Issuer\nRisk. The performance of the Fund\ndepends on the performance of\nindividual securities to which\nthe Fund or the Underlying Funds\nhave exposure. The Fund may be\nadversely affected if an issuer\nof underlying securities held by\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund is\nunable or unwilling to repay\nprincipal or interest when due.\nAny issuer of these securities\nmay perform poorly, causing the\nvalue of its securities to\ndecline. Poor performance may be\ncaused by poor management\ndecisions, competitive pressures,\nchanges in technology, expiration\nof patent protection, disruptions\nin supply, labor problems or\nshortages, corporate\nrestructurings, fraudulent\ndisclosures, credit deterioration\nof the issuer or other factors.\nChanges to the financial\ncondition or 10 credit rating of\nan issuer of those securities may\ncause the value of the securities\nto decline. An issuer may also be\nsubject to risks associated with\nthe countries, states and regions\nin which the issuer resides,\ninvests, sells products, or\notherwise conducts operations.\nManagement Risk. Because BFA uses\na representative sampling\nindexing strategy, the Fund will\nnot fully replicate the\nUnderlying Index and may hold\nsecurities not included in the\nUnderlying Index. As a result,\nthe Fund is subject to the risk\nthat BFA\u2019s investment strategy,\nthe implementation of which is\nsubject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the\nintended results. The Fund is\nalso subject to the risk that the\ninvestment strategy of an\nUnderlying Fund may not produce\nthe intended results. Market\nRisk. The Fund and the Underlying\nFunds could lose money over short\nperiods due to short-term market\nmovements and over longer periods\nduring more prolonged market\ndownturns. The value of a\nfinancial instrument or other\nasset may decline due to changes\nin general market conditions,\neconomic trends or events that\nare not specifically related to\nthe particular instrument or\nasset, or factors that affect one\nor more issuers, counterparties,\nexchanges, countries, regions,\nmarkets, industries, sectors or\nasset classes, as applicable.\nLocal, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism,\npublic health issues, recessions,\nthe prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact\non the Fund, the Underlying Funds\nand their investments and could\nresult in increased premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u2019s or\nUnderlying Fund's NAV. Changes in\nmarket and economic conditions\ngenerally do not have the same\nimpact on all types of\ninstruments and assets. Market\nTrading Risk. Absence of Active\nMarket. Although shares of the\nFund and the Underlying Funds are\nlisted for trading on one or more\nstock exchanges, there can be no\nassurance that an active trading\nmarket for such shares will\ndevelop or be maintained by\nmarket makers or Authorized\nParticipants. Risk of Secondary\nListings. The Fund's and each\nUnderlying Fund's shares may be\nlisted or traded on U.S. and\nnon-U.S. stock exchanges other\nthan the U.S. stock exchange\nwhere the Fund's or Underlying\nFund's primary listing is\nmaintained, and may otherwise be\nmade available to non-U.S.\ninvestors through funds or\nstructured investment vehicles\nsimilar to depositary receipts.\nThere can be no assurance that\nthe Fund\u2019s or each Underlying\nFund's shares will continue to\ntrade on any such stock exchange\nor in any market or that the\nFund\u2019s or each Underlying Fund's\nshares will continue to meet the\nrequirements for listing or\ntrading on any exchange or in any\nmarket. The Fund's or Underlying\nFund's shares may be less\nactively traded in certain\nmarkets than in others, and\ninvestors are subject to the\nexecution and settlement risks\nand market standards of the\nmarket where they or their broker\ndirect their trades for\nexecution. Certain information\navailable to investors who trade\nFund or Underlying Fund shares on\na U.S. stock exchange during\nregular U.S. market hours may not\nbe available to investors who\ntrade in other markets, which may\nresult in secondary market prices\nin such markets being less\nefficient. 11 Secondary Market\nTrading Risk. Shares of the Fund\nor the Underlying Funds may trade\nin the secondary market at times\nwhen the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds do not accept orders to\npurchase or redeem shares. At\nsuch times, shares may trade in\nthe secondary market with more\nsignificant premiums or discounts\nthan might be experienced at\ntimes when the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds accept purchase\nand redemption orders. If the\nFund purchases shares of an\nUnderlying Fund at a time when\nthe market price of Underlying\nFund shares is at a premium to\ntheir NAV or sells Underlying\nFund shares when their market\nprice is at a discount to their\nNAV, the Fund may incur losses.\nSecondary market trading in Fund\nor Underlying Fund shares may be\nhalted by a stock exchange\nbecause of market conditions or\nfor other reasons. In addition,\ntrading in Fund or Underlying\nFund shares on a stock exchange\nor in any market may be subject\nto trading halts caused by\nextraordinary market volatility\npursuant to \u201c circuit breaker \u201d\nrules on the stock exchange or\nmarket. Shares of the Fund and\nthe Underlying Funds, similar to\nshares of other issuers listed on\na stock exchange, may be sold\nshort and are therefore subject\nto the risk of increased\nvolatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short.\nIn addition, trading activity in\nderivative products based on the\nFund or an Underlying Fund may\nlead to increased trading volume\nand volatility in the secondary\nmarket for the shares of the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund. Shares of\nthe Fund and the Underlying Funds\nMay Trade at Prices Other Than\nNAV. Shares of the Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds each trade on\nstock exchanges at prices at,\nabove or below the Fund\u2019s and the\nUnderlying Fund's most recent\nrespective NAV. The NAV of the\nFund and each Underlying Fund is\ncalculated at the end of each\nbusiness day and fluctuates with\nchanges in the market value of\nthe Fund\u2019s or an Underlying\nFund's holdings. The trading\nprice of each of the Fund's and\nUnderlying Funds' shares\nfluctuates continuously\nthroughout trading hours based on\nboth market supply of and demand\nfor their shares and the\nunderlying value of their\nportfolio holdings or NAV. As a\nresult, the trading prices of the\nFund\u2019s and each Underlying Fund's\nshares may deviate significantly\nfrom NAV during periods of market\nvolatility, including during\nperiods of significant redemption\nrequests or other unusual market\nconditions. ANY OF THESE FACTORS,\nAMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE\nFUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUNDS'\nSHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR\nDISCOUNT TO NAV . However,\nbecause shares can be created and\nredeemed in Creation Units at\nNAV, BFA believes that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the NAV\nof the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds, as applicable, are not\nlikely to be sustained over the\nlong term (unlike shares of many\nclosed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While\nthe creation/redemption feature\nis designed to make it more\nlikely that the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's shares normally\nwill trade on stock exchanges at\nprices close to the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's next calculated\nNAV, exchange prices are not\nexpected to correlate exactly\nwith their respective NAV due to\ntiming reasons, supply and demand\nimbalances and other factors. In\naddition, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions,\nincluding disruptions at market\nmakers, Authorized Participants,\nor other market participants, and\nduring periods of significant\nmarket volatility, may result in\n12 trading prices for shares of\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund\nthat differ significantly from\ntheir respective NAV. Authorized\nParticipants may be less willing\nto create or redeem Fund or\nUnderlying Fund shares if there\nis a lack of an active market for\nsuch shares or its underlying\ninvestments, which may contribute\nto the Fund\u2019s or Underlying\nFund's shares trading at a\npremium or discount to NAV. Costs\nof Buying or Selling Fund Shares.\nBuying or selling Fund shares on\nan exchange involves two types of\ncosts that apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling shares of the\nFund through a broker, you will\nlikely incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. In\naddition, you may incur the cost\nof the \u201c spread \u201d ; that is, the\ndifference between what investors\nare willing to pay for Fund\nshares (the \u201c bid \u201d price) and\nthe price at which they are\nwilling to sell Fund shares (the\n\u201c ask \u201d price). The spread, which\nvaries over time for shares of\nthe Fund based on trading volume\nand market liquidity, is\ngenerally narrower if the Fund\nhas more trading volume and\nmarket liquidity and wider if the\nFund has less trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. In addition,\nincreased market volatility may\ncause wider spreads. There may\nalso be regulatory and other\ncharges that are incurred as a\nresult of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in\nbuying or selling Fund shares,\nfrequent trading may detract\nsignificantly from investment\nresults and an investment in Fund\nshares may not be advisable for\ninvestors who anticipate\nregularly making small\ninvestments through a brokerage\naccount. Model Risk. Neither the\nFund nor BFA can offer any\nassurance that the allocation\nmodel used to calculate the\nUnderlying Index will achieve its\nintended results or maximize\nreturns or minimize risks, nor\ncan the Fund or BFA offer\nassurance that a particular\nallocation will be the\nappropriate allocation in all\ncircumstances for every investor\nseeking a particular risk profile\nor time horizon. Non-U.S. Issuers\nRisk . Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers have different\nrisks from securities issued by\nU.S. issuers. These risks include\ndifferences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting\nstandards, the possibility of\nexpropriation or confiscatory\ntaxation, adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control\nregulations, political\ninstability which could affect\nU.S. investments in non-U.S.\ncountries, uncertainties of\ntransnational litigation, and\npotential restrictions on the\nflow of international capital,\nincluding the possible seizure or\nnationalization of the securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers held\nby the Fund or an Underlying\nFund. Non-U.S. issuers may be\nsubject to less governmental\nregulation than U.S. issuers.\nMoreover, individual non-U.S.\neconomies may differ favorably or\nunfavorably from the U.S. economy\nin such respects as growth of\ngross domestic product, rate of\ninflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and\nbalance of payment positions.\nUnfavorable political, economic\nor governmental developments in\nnon-U.S. countries could affect\nthe payment of a security\u2019s\nprincipal and interest.\nSecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers may also be less liquid\nthan, and more difficult to value\nthan, securities of U.S. issuers.\nIn addition, the value of these\nsecurities may fluctuate due to\nchanges in the exchange rate of\nthe issuer\u2019s local currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar.\nOperational Risk. The Fund and\nthe Underlying Funds are exposed\nto operational risks arising from\na number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund's or\neach Underlying Fund's service 13\nproviders, counterparties or\nother third parties, failed or\ninadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures.\nThe Fund, the Underlying Funds\nand BFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Privately\nIssued Securities Risk. The Fund\nor Underlying Funds may invest in\nprivately issued securities,\nincluding those that are normally\npurchased pursuant to Rule 144A\nor Regulation S under the 1933\nAct. Privately issued securities\ntypically may be resold only to\nqualified institutional buyers,\nor in a privately negotiated\ntransaction, or to a limited\nnumber of purchasers, or in\nlimited quantities after they\nhave been held for a specified\nperiod of time and other\nconditions are met for an\nexemption from registration.\nBecause there may be relatively\nfew potential purchasers for such\nsecurities, especially under\nadverse market or economic\nconditions or in the event of\nadverse changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuer, the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund may find it\nmore difficult to sell such\nsecurities when it may be\nadvisable to do so or it may be\nable to sell such securities only\nat prices lower than if such\nsecurities were more widely held\nand traded. At times, it also may\nbe more difficult to determine\nthe fair value of such securities\nfor purposes of computing the\nFund\u2019s NAV due to the absence of\nan active trading market. There\ncan be no assurance that a\nprivately issued security that is\ndeemed to be liquid when\npurchased will continue to be\nliquid for as long as it is held\nby the Fund or an Underlying\nFund, and its value may decline\nas a result. Reinvestment Risk .\nThe Fund or an Underlying Fund\nmay invest a portion of its\nassets in short-term fixed-income\ninstruments and as a result, may\nbe adversely affected when\ninterest rates fall because they\nmay have to invest in lower\nyielding bonds as bonds in the\nUnderlying Index are substituted.\nThis may cause the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's income to\ndecline, which may adversely\naffect the value of the Fund.\nThis risk is typically greater\nwith respect to short-term bond\nfunds and lower for long-term\nbond funds. Risk of Investing in\nChina. Investments in bonds of\nChinese issuers (including\nvariable interest entities\nassociated with an underlying\nChinese operating company)\nsubject the Fund to risks\nspecific to China. The Chinese\neconomy is subject to a\nconsiderable degree of economic,\npolitical and social instability.\nPolitical and Social Risk. The\nChinese government is\nauthoritarian and has\nperiodically used force to\nsuppress civil dissent.\nDisparities of wealth and the\npace of economic liberalization\nmay lead to social turmoil,\nviolence and labor unrest. In\naddition, China continues to\nexperience disagreements related\nto integration with Hong Kong and\nreligious and nationalist\ndisputes in Tibet and Xinjiang.\nThere is also a greater risk in\nChina than in many other\ncountries of currency\nfluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate\nfluctuations and higher rates of\ninflation as a result of internal\nsocial unrest or conflicts with\nother countries. Unanticipated\npolitical or social developments\nmay result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses.\nChina's growing income\ninequality, rapidly aging\npopulation and significant\nenvironmental issues also are\nfactors that may affect the\nChinese economy. 14 Government\nControl and Regulations. The\nChinese government has\nimplemented significant economic\nreforms in order to liberalize\ntrade policy, promote foreign\ninvestment in the economy, reduce\ngovernment control of the economy\nand develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, government control over\ncertain sectors or enterprises\nand significant regulation of\ninvestment and industry is still\npervasive, including restrictions\non investment in companies or\nindustries deemed to be sensitive\nto particular national interests,\ntrading of securities of Chinese\nissuers, foreign ownership of\nChinese corporations and/or the\nrepatriation of assets by foreign\ninvestors. Limitations or\nrestrictions on foreign ownership\nof securities may have adverse\neffects on the liquidity and\nperformance of the Underlying\nFund and could lead to higher\ntracking error. Chinese\ngovernment intervention in the\nmarket may have a negative impact\non market sentiment, which may in\nturn affect the performance of\nthe Chinese economy and the\nFund\u2019s investments. Chinese\nmarkets generally continue to\nexperience inefficiency,\nvolatility and pricing anomalies\nthat may be connected to\ngovernmental influence, lack of\npublicly available information,\nand political and social\ninstability. Chinese issuers,\nsuch as those in the financial\nservices or technology sectors,\nand potentially other sectors are\nalso subject to the risk that\nChinese authorities can intervene\nin their operations and\nstructure, which may negatively\naffect the value of the Fund's or\nan Underlying Fund's investments.\nEconomic Risk. The Chinese\neconomy may be adversely affected\nby, among other things, a\ndeterioration in global demand\nfor Chinese exports or a\ncontraction in spending on\ndomestic goods by Chinese\nconsumers. In addition, China may\nexperience substantial rates of\ninflation, significant\nindebtedness or economic\nrecessions, which would have a\nnegative effect on its economy\nand securities market. Delays in\nenterprise restructuring, slow\ndevelopment of well-functioning\nfinancial markets and widespread\ncorruption have also hindered the\nperformance of the Chinese\neconomy. China continues to\nreceive substantial pressure from\ntrading partners to liberalize\nofficial currency exchange rates.\nReduction in spending on Chinese\nproducts and services, supply\nchain diversification,\ninstitution of additional\ntariffs, sanctions or other trade\nbarriers (including as a result\nof heightened trade tensions\nbetween China and the U.S. or in\nresponse to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a\ndownturn in any of the economies\nof China\u2019s key trading partners\nmay have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy and companies in\nwhich the Fund invests. Certain\nChinese companies (which may\nchange from time to time) are\ndirectly or indirectly subject to\neconomic or trade restrictions\nimposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national\nsecurity, human rights or other\nconcerns of such government. For\nexample, certain foreign\ntechnology companies are subject\nto U.S. export controls as those\ncompanies are believed to pose a\nrisk to U.S. interests. The U.S.\nalso bans imports of goods\nproduced in certain regions of\nChina or by certain Chinese\ncompanies due to concerns about\nforced labor. Such restrictions\nmay have unanticipated and\nadverse effects on the Chinese\neconomy and companies. Any action\nthat targets Chinese financial\nmarkets or securities exchanges\ncould interfere with orderly\ntrading, delay settlement or\ncause market disruptions. The\nUnderlying Index may include\ncompanies that are subject to\neconomic or trade restrictions\n(but not investment restrictions)\nimposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments. So long as these\nrestrictions do not include\nrestrictions on investments, the\nFund is generally expected 15 to\ninvest in such companies,\nconsistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Expropriation\nRisk. The Chinese government\nmaintains a major role in\neconomic policymaking, and\ninvesting in China involves risk\nof loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of\nassets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and on\nrepatriation of capital invested.\nSecurity Risk. China has strained\ninternational relations with\nTaiwan, Japan, India, Russia and\nother neighbors due to\nterritorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, defense concerns and\nother security concerns.\nHeightened tensions or an\noutbreak of hostilities between\nChina and Taiwan may adversely\nimpact China\u2019s economy as well as\nthe global economy and the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investments.\nAdditionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against\nforeign companies and foreign\ngovernments. Actual and\nthreatened responses to such\nactivity and strained\ninternational relations,\nincluding purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs\nor cyberattacks on the Chinese\ngovernment or Chinese companies,\nmay impact China\u2019s economy and\nChinese issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests. Relations\nbetween China\u2019s Han ethnic\nmajority and other ethnic groups\nin China, including Tibetans and\nUighurs, are also strained and\nhave been marked by protests and\nviolence. These situations may\ncause uncertainty in the Chinese\nmarket and may adversely affect\nthe Chinese economy. In addition,\nconflict on the Korean Peninsula\ncould adversely affect the\nChinese economy. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. Hong Kong Political\nRisk. Hong Kong reverted to\nChinese sovereignty on July 1,\n1997 as a Special Administrative\nRegion of the People's Republic\nof China under the principle of \u201c\none country, two systems. \u201d\nAlthough China is obligated to\nmaintain the current capitalist\neconomic and social system of\nHong Kong through June 30, 2047,\nthe continuation of economic and\nsocial freedoms enjoyed in Hong\nKong is dependent on the\ngovernment of China. Since 1997,\nthere have been tensions between\nthe Chinese government and many\npeople in Hong Kong who perceive\nChina as tightening control over\nHong Kong\u2019s semi-autonomous\nliberal political, economic,\nlegal and social framework.\nRecent protests and unrest have\nincreased tensions even further.\nDue to the interconnected nature\nof the Hong Kong and Chinese\neconomies, this instability in\nHong Kong may cause uncertainty\nin the Hong Kong and Chinese\nmarkets. In addition, the Hong\nKong dollar trades at a fixed\nexchange rate in relation to (or\nis \u201c pegged \u201d to) the U.S.\ndollar, which has contributed to\nthe growth and stability of the\nHong Kong economy. However, it is\nuncertain how long the currency\npeg will continue or what effect\nthe establishment of an\nalternative exchange rate system\nwould have on the Hong Kong\neconomy. Because the Fund's NAV\nis denominated in U.S. dollars,\nthe establishment of an\nalternative exchange rate system\ncould result in a decline in the\nFund's NAV. Limited Information\nand Legal Remedies . Chinese\nissuers are not subject to the\nsame degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting\nstandards or auditor oversight as\nissuers in more developed\ncountries. As a result,\ninformation about the Chinese\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests may be less reliable or\ncomplete. There may be\nsignificant obstacles to\nobtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or 16\nlitigation against Chinese\nissuers, and investors may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund\nis not actively managed and does\nnot select investments based on\ninvestor protection\nconsiderations. Risk of Investing\nin Developed Countries.\nInvestment in developed country\nissuers will subject the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund to regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security,\neconomic and other risks\nassociated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries\ngenerally tend to rely on\nservices sectors ( e.g., the\nfinancial services sector) as the\nprimary means of economic growth.\nA prolonged slowdown in one or\nmore services sectors is likely\nto have a negative impact on\neconomies of certain developed\ncountries, although economies of\nindividual developed countries\ncan be impacted by slowdowns in\nother sectors. In the past,\ncertain developed countries have\nbeen targets of terrorism, and\nsome geographic areas in which\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund\ninvests have experienced strained\ninternational relations due to\nterritorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, defense concerns and\nother security concerns. These\nsituations may cause uncertainty\nin the financial markets in these\ncountries or geographic areas and\nmay adversely affect the\nperformance of the issuers to\nwhich the Fund or an Underlying\nFund has exposure. Heavy\nregulation of certain markets,\nincluding labor and product\nmarkets, may have an adverse\neffect on certain issuers. Such\nregulations may negatively affect\neconomic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession.\nMany developed countries are\nheavily indebted and face rising\nhealthcare and retirement\nexpenses. In addition, price\nfluctuations of certain\ncommodities and regulations\nimpacting the import of\ncommodities may negatively affect\ndeveloped country economies. Risk\nof Investing in Saudi Arabia. The\nability of foreign investors\n(such as the Fund and Underlying\nFund) to invest in the securities\nof Saudi Arabian issuers is\nrelatively new. Such ability\ncould be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time,\nand unforeseen risks could\nmaterialize with respect to\nforeign ownership in such\nsecurities. In addition, the\nSaudi Arabian government places\ninvestment limitations on the\nownership of Saudi Arabian\nissuers by foreign investors,\nincluding a limitation on the\nFund\u2019s and Underlying Fund's\nownership of any single issuer\nlisted on the Saudi Arabian Stock\nExchange, which may prevent the\nFund from investing in accordance\nwith its strategy and contribute\nto tracking error against the\nUnderlying Index. Saudi Arabia is\nhighly reliant on income from the\nsale of petroleum and trade with\nother countries involved in the\nsale of petroleum, and its\neconomy is therefore vulnerable\nto changes in foreign currency\nvalues and the market for\npetroleum. As global demand for\npetroleum fluctuates, Saudi\nArabia may be significantly\nimpacted. Like most Middle\nEastern governments, the\ngovernment of Saudi Arabia\nexercises substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private\nsector. Although liberalization\nin the wider economy is underway,\nin many areas it has lagged\nsignificantly: restrictions on\nforeign ownership persist, and\nthe government has an ownership\nstake in many key industries. The\nsituation is exacerbated by the\nfact that Saudi Arabia is\ngoverned by an absolute monarchy.\nSaudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced strained relations\nwith economic partners worldwide,\nincluding other countries in the\nMiddle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Governmental actions in\nthe future could have a\nsignificant effect on economic\nconditions in Saudi Arabia, which\ncould affect private sector\ncompanies and the Fund and\nUnderlying Fund, as well as the\nvalue of securities in the Fund\u2019s\nor Underlying 17 Fund's\nportfolio. Any economic sanctions\non Saudi Arabian individuals or\nSaudi Arabian corporate entities,\nor even the threat of sanctions,\nmay result in the decline of the\nvalue and liquidity of Saudi\nArabian securities, a weakening\nof the Saudi riyal or other\nadverse consequences to the Saudi\nArabian economy. In addition,\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s economy relies\nheavily on cheap, foreign labor,\nand changes in the availability\nof this labor supply could have\nan adverse effect on the economy.\nInvestments in the securities of\nSaudi Arabian issuers involve\nrisks not typically associated\nwith investments in securities of\nissuers in more developed\ncountries that may negatively\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s or\nUnderlying Fund's investments.\nSuch heightened risks may\ninclude, among others,\nexpropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets,\nrestrictions on and government\nintervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation,\npolitical instability, including\nauthoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental\ndecision making, armed conflict,\ncrime and instability as a result\nof religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Although\nthe political situation in Saudi\nArabia is largely stable, Saudi\nArabia has historically\nexperienced political\ninstability, and there remains\nthe possibility that instability\nin the larger Middle East region\ncould adversely impact the\neconomy of Saudi Arabia.\nPolitical instability in the\nlarger Middle East region has\ncaused significant disruptions to\nmany industries. Continued\npolitical and social unrest in\nthese areas may negatively affect\nthe value of securities in the\nFund\u2019s or Underlying Fund's\nportfolio. Risk of Investing in\nthe U.S. A decrease in imports or\nexports, changes in trade\nregulations, inflation and/or an\neconomic recession in the U.S.\nmay have a material adverse\neffect on the U.S. economy and\nthe securities listed on U.S.\nexchanges. Proposed and adopted\npolicy and legislative changes in\nthe U.S. are changing many\naspects of financial, commercial,\npublic health, environmental, and\nother regulation and may have a\nsignificant effect on U.S.\nmarkets generally, as well as on\nthe value of certain securities.\nGovernmental agencies project\nthat the U.S. will continue to\nmaintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable\nfuture. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily\nindicate or cause economic\nproblems, elevated public debt\nservice costs may constrain\nfuture economic growth.\nCircumstances could arise that\ncould prevent the timely payment\nof interest or principal on U.S.\ngovernment debt, such as reaching\nthe legislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. If U.S.\nrelations with certain countries\ndeteriorate, it could adversely\naffect U.S. issuers as well as\nnon-U.S. issuers that rely on the\nU.S. for trade. The U.S. has also\nexperienced increased internal\nunrest and discord. If these\ntrends were to continue, it may\nhave an adverse impact on the\nU.S. economy and the issuers in\nwhich the Fund or an Underlying\nFund invests. Securities Lending\nRisk. The Fund and the Underlying\nFunds may engage in securities\nlending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund may lose\nmoney because the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return\nthe securities in a timely manner\nor at all. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline\nin the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or\na decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash\ncollateral. These events 18 could\nalso trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund. BlackRock\nInstitutional Trust Company, N.A.\n( \u201c BTC \u201d ), the Fund's\nsecurities lending agent, will\ntake into account the tax impact\nto shareholders of substitute\npayments for dividends when\nmanaging the Fund's securities\nlending program. Tracking Error\nRisk. The Fund may be subject to\n\u201c tracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's performance\nfrom that of the applicable\nunderlying index. Tracking error\nmay occur because of differences\nbetween the securities and other\ninstruments held in the Fund\u2019s or\nan Underlying Fund's portfolio\nand those included in the\napplicable underlying index,\npricing differences (including,\nas applicable, differences\nbetween a security\u2019s price at the\nlocal market close and the Fund's\nor an Underlying Fund's valuation\nof a security at the time of\ncalculation of the Fund's or\nUnderlying Fund's NAV,\nrespectively), transaction costs\nincurred by the Fund, the Fund\u2019s\nor an Underlying Fund's holding\nof uninvested cash, differences\nin timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of distributions, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-\nthrough tax treatment, portfolio\ntransactions carried out to\nminimize the distribution of\ncapital gains to shareholders,\nacceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the applicable\nunderlying index or the costs to\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund of\ncomplying with various new or\nexisting regulatory requirements,\namong other reasons. This risk\nmay be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund or an Underlying\nFund incurs fees and expenses,\nwhile the applicable underlying\nindex does not. Valuation Risk.\nThe price the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund could receive\nupon the sale of a security or\nother asset may differ from the\nFund's or an Underlying Fund's\nvaluation of the security or\nother asset and from the value\nused by its underlying index,\nparticularly for securities or\nother assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or\nthat are valued using a fair\nvalue methodology as a result of\ntrade suspensions or for other\nreasons. Because non-U.S.\nexchanges may be open on days or\nduring time periods when the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund does not\nprice its shares, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund's\nportfolio may change on days or\nduring time periods when the Fund\nwill not be able to purchase or\nsell the Fund or an Underlying\nFund\u2019s shares. In addition, for\npurposes of calculating the\nFund's NAV, the value of assets\ndenominated in non-U.S.\ncurrencies is translated into\nU.S. dollars at the prevailing\nmarket rates. This translation\nmay result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to\ncalculate the Fund's NAV and the\nprices used by its underlying\nindex, which, in turn, could\nresult in a difference between\nthe Fund's performance and the\nperformance of its underlying\nindex. Authorized Participants\nwho purchase or redeem Fund\nshares on days when the Fund is\nholding fair-valued securities\nmay receive fewer or more shares,\nor lower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities not\nbeen fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology.\nThe ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological\nissues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party\nservice providers. 19 A Further\nDiscussion of Other Risks The\nFund may also be subject to\ncertain other risks associated\nwith its investments and\ninvestment strategies. The order\nof the below risk factors does\nnot indicate the significance of\nany particular risk factor. Asian\nEconomic Risk. Certain Asian\neconomies have experienced rapid\ngrowth and industrialization in\nrecent years, but there is no\nassurance that this growth rate\nwill be maintained. Other Asian\neconomies, however, have\nexperienced high inflation, high\nunemployment, currency\ndevaluations and restrictions,\nand over-extension of credit.\nGeopolitical hostility, political\ninstability, and economic or\nenvironmental events in any one\nAsian country may have a\nsignificant economic effect on\nthe entire Asian region, as well\nas on major trading partners\noutside Asia. Any adverse event\nin the Asian markets may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on\nsome or all of the economies of\nthe countries in which the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund invests. In\nparticular, China is a key\ntrading partner of many Asian\ncountries and any changes in\ntrading relationships between\nChina and other Asian countries\nmay affect the region as a whole.\nMany Asian countries are subject\nto political risk, including\npolitical instability, corruption\nand regional conflict with\nneighboring countries. North\nKorea and South Korea each have\nsubstantial military\ncapabilities, and historical\ntensions between the two\ncountries present the risk of\nwar. Escalated tensions involving\nthe two countries and any\noutbreak of hostilities between\nthe two countries, or even the\nthreat of an outbreak of\nhostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire\nAsian region. Certain Asian\ncountries have developed\nincreasingly strained\nrelationships with the U.S. or\nwith China, and if these\nrelations were to worsen, they\ncould adversely affect Asian\nissuers that rely on the U.S. or\nChina for trade. In addition,\nmany Asian countries are subject\nto social and labor risks\nassociated with demands for\nimproved political, economic and\nsocial conditions. These risks,\namong others, may adversely\naffect the value of the Fund's or\nan Underlying Fund's investments.\nCentral and South American\nEconomic Risk. Certain Central\nand South American countries have\nexperienced high interest rates,\neconomic volatility, high levels\nof inflation, currency\ndevaluations, regime changes,\ngovernment defaults and high\nunemployment rates. Additionally,\ncommodities such as oil and gas,\nminerals and metals represent a\nsignificant percentage of the\nregion\u2019s exports, and the\neconomies of countries in the\nregion are particularly sensitive\nto fluctuations in commodity\nprices as a result. The impact of\nany of the foregoing events in\none country could have a\nsignificant effect on the entire\nregion. Close-Out Risk for\nQualified Financial Contracts.\nRegulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require\ncounterparties that are part of\nU.S. or foreign global\nsystemically important banking\norganizations to include\ncontractual restrictions on\nclose-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified\nfinancial contracts. Qualified\nfinancial contracts include\nagreements relating to swaps,\ncurrency forwards and other\nderivatives as well as repurchase\nagreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions\nprevent the Fund from closing out\na qualified financial contract\nduring a specified time period if\nthe counterparty is subject to\nresolution proceedings and also\nprohibit the Fund from exercising\ndefault rights due to a 20\nreceivership or similar\nproceeding of an affiliate of the\ncounterparty. These requirements\nmay increase credit risk and\nother risks to the Fund.\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed\nSecurities Risk. The commercial\nmortgage-backed securities ( \u201c\nCMBS \u201d ) in which the Fund\ninvests may be issued by\nentities, such as banks, mortgage\nlenders or other institutions.\nThese entities are not backed by\nthe full faith and credit of the\nU.S. government, and there can be\nno assurance that the U.S.\ngovernment would provide\nfinancial support to its agencies\nor instrumentalities where it is\nnot obligated to do so. CMBS\ndepend on cash flows generated by\nunderlying commercial real-estate\nloans, receivables or other\nassets, and can be significantly\naffected by changes in interest\nrates, the availability of\ninformation concerning the\nunderlying assets and their\nstructure, and the\ncreditworthiness of the\noriginators of the underlying\nassets. Due to the nature of the\nloans they represent, CMBS are\nsubject to a greater degree of\nprepayment and extension risk\nthan many other forms of fixed-\nincome securities. Small\nmovements in interest rates (both\nincreases and decreases) may\nquickly and significantly reduce\nthe value of certain CMBS.\nCertain CMBS are issued in\nseveral classes with different\nlevels of yield and credit\nprotection. The Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in CMBS with several\nclasses may be in the lower\nclasses that have greater risks\nthan the higher classes,\nincluding greater interest rate,\ncredit, prepayment and extension\nrisks. In addition, the value of\nCMBS may be adversely affected by\nregulatory or tax changes. CMBS\nissued by non-government entities\nmay offer higher yields than\nthose issued by government\nentities, but also may be subject\nto greater volatility than\ngovernment issues. In the recent\npast, the market for CMBS has\nexperienced volatility and\nreduced liquidity. Commodity\nRisk. Companies whose performance\nis reflected in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio or Underlying Index may\nbe adversely affected by changes\nor trends in commodity prices.\nCommodity prices may be\ninfluenced or characterized by\nunpredictable factors, including,\nwhere applicable, high\nvolatility, changes in supply and\ndemand relationships, weather,\nagriculture, trade, pestilence,\npolitical instability, war,\ncatastrophic events, changes in\ninterest rates and monetary and\nother governmental policies,\naction and inaction, including\nprice changes due to trade\nrelations. Securities of\ncompanies held by the Fund that\nare dependent on a single\ncommodity, or are concentrated in\na single commodity sector, may\ntypically exhibit even higher\nvolatility attributable to\ncommodity prices. Consumer Goods\nand Services Companies Risk. Many\nconsumer goods and services\ncompanies ( \u201c consumer companies\n\u201d ) rely heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer\nspending and may be impacted by\nsocial trends, marketing\ncampaigns, demographic shifts and\nother factors affecting consumer\npreferences and demand. In\naddition, damage to a brand or a\nreputation crisis can have a\nsubstantial adverse impact on\nconsumer companies. Certain\nconsumer companies, such as those\nproviding more discretionary\ngoods or services, may depend\nmore on business cycles, overall\neconomic conditions and consumer\nconfidence. Many consumer goods\nand services are subject to\ngovernment regulation and the\nrelated compliance costs, and\nconsumer companies also face the\n21 risk of product liability\nclaims. Consumer companies also\nmay be adversely affected by\nvolatility in commodity prices,\nsupply chain disruptions and\nlabor shortages. Custody Risk. An\nUnderlying Fund may be exposed to\ncustody risk. Custody risk refers\nto the risks inherent in the\nprocess of clearing and settling\ntrades, as well as the holding of\nsecurities by local banks, agents\nand depositories. Low trading\nvolumes and volatile prices in\nless developed markets may make\ntrades harder to complete and\nsettle, and governments or trade\ngroups may compel local agents to\nhold securities in designated\ndepositories that may not be\nsubject to independent\nevaluation. Local agents are held\nonly to the standards of care of\ntheir local markets. In general,\nthe less developed a country\u2019s\nsecurities markets are, the\nhigher the degree of custody\nrisk. Energy Sector Risk. The\nmarket value of securities issued\nby companies in the energy sector\nmay decline for the following\nreasons, among others: changes in\nand volatility of global energy\nprices, energy supply and demand,\nand spending on exploration and\nproduction of energy sources;\nexchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, and tax\ntreatment; changes in the actual\nor perceived availability of oil\nor other resource deposits; the\nenactment or cessation of trade\nsanctions or import controls; war\nor other geopolitical conflicts;\nnegative perception; increased\nlitigation; energy conservation\nefforts; energy infrastructure\ndevelopments or service failures;\nand increased competition and\ntechnological advances. Companies\nin this sector may be subject to\nsubstantial government regulation\nand contractual fixed pricing,\nwhich may increase the cost of\ndoing business and limit the\nearnings of these companies. A\nsignificant portion of the\nrevenues of these companies may\ndepend on a relatively small\nnumber of customers, including\ngovernmental entities and\nutilities. As a result,\ngovernmental budget constraints\nmay have a material adverse\neffect on the stock prices of\ncompanies in this sector. Energy\ncompanies may also operate in, or\nengage in transactions involving,\ncountries that have less\ndeveloped regulatory regimes or a\nhistory of expropriation,\nconfiscation of assets, foreign\ninvestment restrictions,\nnationalization or other adverse\npolicies or that are at greater\nrisk of political and social\nunrest, coups or labor\ndisruptions. Energy companies\nalso face a significant risk of\nliability from accidents\nresulting in injury or loss of\nlife or property, pollution or\nother environmental problems,\nequipment malfunctions or\nmishandling of materials and a\nrisk of loss from terrorism,\ncyber incident, political strife\nor natural disasters. Any such\nevent could have serious\nconsequences for the general\npopulation of the affected area\nand could have an adverse impact\non the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying\nFund's portfolio and the\nperformance of the Fund. Energy\ncompanies may have relatively\nhigh levels of debt and may be\nmore likely than other companies\nto restructure their businesses\nif there are downturns in energy\nmarkets or in the global economy.\nEnergy production companies,\nespecially those for oil and gas,\nmay also have to contend with\nservice disruptions, pipeline and\nequipment leaks and ruptures,\nexplosions, fires, unscheduled\ndowntime, transportation\ninterruptions, discharges or\nreleases of toxic or hazardous\ngases and other environmental\nrisks. The energy sector may\nexperience significant market\nvolatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine\non February 24, 2022 led to\ndisruptions and increased\nvolatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to\nactual and potential 22\ndisruptions in the supply and\ndemand for certain commodities,\nincluding oil and natural gas.\nThe U.S. and other actors have,\nin response, enacted various\nsanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia,\nwhich include restrictions on\nimports of oil, natural gas and\ncoal. The effect of the current\nsanctions and restrictions, as\nwell as the extent and duration\nof the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and\nassociated market disruptions on\nthe energy sector, are impossible\nto predict and depend on a number\nof factors. The effect of these\nevents or any related\ndevelopments could be significant\nand may have a severe adverse\neffect on the performance of the\nFund. European Economic Risk. The\nEconomic and Monetary Union (the\n\u201c eurozone \u201d ) of the European\nUnion (the \u201c EU \u201d ) requires\ncompliance by member states that\nare members of the eurozone with\nrestrictions on inflation rates,\ndeficits, interest rates and debt\nlevels, as well as fiscal and\nmonetary controls, each of which\nmay significantly affect every\ncountry in Europe, including\nthose countries that are not\nmembers of the eurozone.\nAdditionally, European countries\noutside of the eurozone may\npresent economic risks that are\nindependent of the indirect\neffects that eurozone policies\nhave on them. In particular, the\nUnited Kingdom's (the \u201c U.K. \u201d )\neconomy may be affected by global\neconomic, industrial and\nfinancial shifts. Changes in\nimports or exports, changes in\ngovernmental or EU regulations on\ntrade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro (the common\ncurrency of eurozone countries),\nthe default or threat of default\nby an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt and/or an economic\nrecession in an EU member state\nmay have a significant adverse\neffect on the economies of other\nEU member states and their\ntrading partners. The European\nfinancial markets have\nhistorically experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic\ndownturns or government debt\nlevels in several European\ncountries, including, but not\nlimited to, Austria, Belgium,\nCyprus, France, Greece, Ireland,\nItaly, Portugal, Spain and\nUkraine. These events have\naffected and may in the future\nadversely affect the exchange\nrate of the euro and may\nsignificantly affect European\ncountries. Responses to financial\nproblems by European governments,\ncentral banks and others,\nincluding austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the\ndesired results, may result in\nsocial unrest, may limit future\ngrowth and economic recovery or\nmay have other unintended\nconsequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt\ncould have additional adverse\neffects on economies, financial\nmarkets and asset valuations\naround the world. In addition,\none or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The U.K. left the EU ( \u201c\nBrexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020.\nBrexit could adversely affect\nEuropean or worldwide political,\nregulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute\nto instability in global\npolitical institutions,\nregulatory agencies and financial\nmarkets. The national politics of\ncountries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to\ninfluence by disruptive political\ngroups and ideologies, including,\nfor example, secessionist\nmovements. The governments of\nEuropean countries may be subject\nto change and such countries may\nexperience social and political\nunrest. Unanticipated or sudden\npolitical or social developments\nmay result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses.\nThe occurrence of terrorist\nincidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region could also\nimpact financial markets. The\nimpact of these events is not\nclear 23 but could be significant\nand far-reaching and could\nadversely affect the value and\nliquidity of the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's investments.\nRussian Invasion of Ukraine .\nRussia launched a large-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration\nof the military action, resulting\nsanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and\nthe value of the ruble against\nthe U.S. dollar, are impossible\nto predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused\nby Russian military action or\nother actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or\nresulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity,\nincluding purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts\nor changes in consumer or\npurchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions,\ntariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian\ncompanies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact\nRussia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which the Fund\ninvests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian\nmilitary action may also impact\nthe markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and\nnatural gas, as well as other\nsectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across\nEurope and globally. Floating\nRate Securities Risk. Securities\nwith floating or variable\ninterest rates can be less\nsensitive to interest rate\nchanges than securities with\nfixed interest rates, but may\ndecline in value if their\ninterest rates do not rise as\nmuch, or as quickly, as interest\nrates in general. Conversely,\nfloating rate securities will not\ngenerally increase in value if\ninterest rates decline. A decline\nin interest rates may result in a\nreduction in income received from\nfloating rate securities held by\nthe Fund and may adversely affect\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s shares.\nGenerally, floating rate\nsecurities carry lower yields\nthan fixed securities of the same\nmaturity. The interest rate for a\nfloating rate security resets or\nadjusts periodically by reference\nto a benchmark interest rate. The\nimpact of interest rate changes\non floating rate investments is\ntypically mitigated by the\nperiodic interest rate reset of\nthe investments. Securities with\nlonger durations tend to be more\nsensitive to interest rate\nchanges, usually making them more\nvolatile than securities with\nshorter durations. Floating rate\nsecurities generally are subject\nto legal or contractual\nrestrictions on resale, may trade\ninfrequently, and their value may\nbe impaired when the Fund needs\nto liquidate such loans.\nBenchmark interest rates, such as\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR) or the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR), may not\naccurately track market interest\nrates. Government Debt Risk.\nInvestment in debt instruments\nissued or guaranteed by foreign\nsovereign governments can involve\na high degree of risk. The\ngovernmental entity that controls\nthe repayment of debt may not be\nable or willing to repay the\nprincipal and/or interest when\ndue in accordance with the terms\nof such debt. A governmental\nentity\u2019s willingness or ability\nto repay principal and interest\ndue in a timely manner may be\naffected by, among other factors,\nits cash flow situation, the\nextent of its foreign reserves,\nthe availability of sufficient\nforeign exchange on the date a\npayment is due, the relative size\nof the debt service burden to the\neconomy as a whole, the\ngovernmental entity\u2019s policy\ntowards the International\nMonetary Fund and the political\nconstraints to which a\ngovernmental entity may be\nsubject. Governmental entities\nalso may be dependent on expected\ndisbursements from other foreign\n24 governments, multilateral\nagencies and others abroad to\nreduce principal and interest\narrearages on their debt. The\ncommitment on the part of these\ngovernments, agencies and others\nto make such disbursements may be\nconditioned on the implementation\nof economic reforms and/or\neconomic performance and the\ntimely service of such debtor\u2019s\nobligations. Failure to implement\nsuch reforms, achieve such levels\nof economic performance or repay\nprincipal or interest when due\nmay result in the cancellation of\nsuch third parties\u2019 commitments\nto lend funds to the governmental\nentity, which may further impair\nsuch debtor\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to timely service its\ndebts. Consequently, governmental\nentities may default on their\ndebt. If a governmental entity\ndefaults, it may ask for more\ntime in which to pay or for\nfurther loans. There is no legal\nprocess for collecting sovereign\ndebt that a government does not\npay nor are there bankruptcy\nproceedings through which all or\npart of the sovereign debt that a\ngovernmental entity has not\nrepaid may be collected. In the\npast, certain governments\u2019\ncountries have refused to honor\ntheir payment obligations on\nissued debt. Healthcare Sector\nRisk. The profitability of\ncompanies in the healthcare\nsector may be adversely affected\nby the following factors, among\nothers: extensive government\nregulations, restrictions on\ngovernment reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of\nmedical products and services,\npricing pressure, an increased\nemphasis on outpatient services,\nchanges in the demand for medical\nproducts and services, a limited\nnumber of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in\ntechnologies and other market\ndevelopments. Many healthcare\ncompanies are heavily dependent\non patent protection. The\nexpiration of a company\u2019s patents\nmay adversely affect that\ncompany\u2019s profitability. Many\nhealthcare companies are subject\nto extensive litigation based on\nproduct liability and similar\nclaims. Healthcare companies are\nsubject to competitive forces\nthat may make it difficult to\nraise prices and, in fact, may\nresult in price discounting. The\nU.S. Inflation Reduction Act of\n2022 allows for the negotiation\nof prescription drug prices on\nbehalf of Medicare recipients,\nwhich may result in reduced\nprescription prices. This could\nreduce some healthcare companies\u2019\noverall profitability. Many new\nproducts in the healthcare sector\nmay be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of\nobtaining such approvals may be\nlong and costly, and such efforts\nultimately may be unsuccessful.\nCompanies in the healthcare\nsector may be thinly capitalized\nand may be susceptible to product\nobsolescence. In addition, a\nnumber of legislative proposals\nconcerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress\nin recent years. It is unclear\nwhat proposals will ultimately be\nenacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the\nhealthcare sector. Large\nShareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders, including an\nAuthorized Participant, a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser or an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, a market maker,\nor another entity, may from time\nto time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares\nor may invest in the Fund and\nhold their investment for a\nlimited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or\nloan Fund shares (to secure\nfinancing or otherwise), which\nmay result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party.\nThere can be no assurance that\nany large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment or that\nthe size of the Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares by\nthese shareholders may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s liquidity and\nnet assets. 25 To the extent the\nFund permits redemptions in cash,\nthese redemptions may force the\nFund to sell portfolio securities\nwhen it might not otherwise do\nso, which may negatively impact\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV, have a material\neffect on the market price of the\nShares and increase the Fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs and/or accelerate\nthe realization of taxable income\nand/or gains and cause the Fund\nto make taxable distributions to\nits shareholders earlier than the\nFund otherwise would have. In\naddition, under certain\ncircumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as\nreceiving a disproportionately\nlarge taxable distribution during\nor with respect to such tax year.\nThe Fund also may be required to\nsell its more liquid Fund\ninvestments to meet a large\nredemption, in which case the\nFund\u2019s remaining assets may be\nless liquid, more volatile, and\nmore difficult to price. To the\nextent these large shareholders\ntransact in shares on the\nsecondary market, such\ntransactions may account for a\nlarge percentage of the trading\nvolume for the shares of the Fund\nand may, therefore, have a\nmaterial upward or downward\neffect on the market price of the\nFund shares. In addition, large\npurchases of Fund shares may\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to the extent that\nthe Fund is delayed in investing\nnew cash and is required to\nmaintain a larger cash position\nthan it ordinarily would,\ndiluting its investment returns.\nMiddle Eastern Economic Risk.\nMany Middle Eastern countries\nhave little or no democratic\ntradition, and the political and\nlegal systems in such countries\nmay adversely impact the\ncompanies in which the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund invests and, as a\nresult, the value of the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund. Middle Eastern\ngovernments have exercised and\ncontinue to exercise substantial\ninfluence over many aspects of\nthe private sector. Many\neconomies in the Middle East are\nhighly reliant on income from the\nsale of oil and natural gas or\ntrade with countries involved in\nthe sale of oil and natural gas,\nand their economies are therefore\nvulnerable to changes in the\nmarket for oil and natural gas\nand foreign currency values. As\nglobal demand for oil and natural\ngas fluctuates, many Middle\nEastern economies may be\nsignificantly impacted. A\nsustained decrease in commodity\nprices could have a significant\nnegative impact on all aspects of\nthe economy in the region. Middle\nEastern economies may be subject\nto acts of terrorism, political\nstrife, religious, ethnic or\nsocioeconomic unrest and sudden\noutbreaks of hostilities with\nneighboring countries. Certain\nMiddle Eastern countries have\nstrained relations with other\nMiddle Eastern countries due to\nterritorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, international\nalliances, religious tensions or\ndefense concerns, which may\nadversely affect the economies of\nthese countries. Certain Middle\nEastern countries experience\nsignificant unemployment, as well\nas widespread underemployment.\nMany Middle Eastern countries\nperiodically have experienced\npolitical, economic and social\nunrest as protestors have called\nfor widespread reform. Some of\nthese protests have resulted in a\ngovernmental regime change,\ninternal conflict or civil war.\nIf further regime changes were to\noccur, internal conflict were to\nintensify, or a civil war were to\ncontinue in any of these\ncountries, such instability could\nadversely affect the economies of\nMiddle Eastern countries in which\nthe Fund or Underlying Fund\ninvests and could decrease the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s or Underlying\nFund's investments. Non-U.S.\nAgency Debt Risk. The Fund and\ncertain Underlying Funds may\ninvest in uncollateralized bonds\nissued by agencies, subdivisions\nor instrumentalities of foreign\n26 governments. Bonds issued by\nthese foreign government\nagencies, subdivisions or\ninstrumentalities are generally\nbacked only by the\ncreditworthiness and reputation\nof the entities issuing the bonds\nand may not be backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the foreign\ngovernment. Moreover, a foreign\ngovernment that explicitly\nprovides its full faith and\ncredit to a particular entity may\nbe, due to changed circumstances,\nunable or unwilling to actually\nprovide that support. If a\nnon-U.S. agency is unable to meet\nits obligations, the performance\nof the Fund or Underlying Fund\nwill be adversely impacted. A\nnon-U.S. agency\u2019s operations and\nfinancial condition are\ninfluenced by the foreign\ngovernment\u2019s economic and other\npolicies. Changes to the\nfinancial condition or credit\nrating of a foreign government\nmay cause the value of debt\nissued by that particular foreign\ngovernment\u2019s agencies,\nsubdivisions or instrumentalities\nto decline. During periods of\neconomic uncertainty, the trading\nof non-U.S. agency bonds may be\nless liquid while market prices\nmay be more volatile than prices\nof U.S. agency bonds. Additional\nrisks associated with non-U.S.\nagency investing include\ndifferences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting\nstandards, adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control\nregulations, political\ninstability, which could affect\nU.S. investments in foreign\ncountries, and potential\nrestrictions of the flow of\ninternational capital. Prepayment\nRisk. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, issuers of\ncertain debt obligations may\nrepay principal prior to the\nsecurity\u2019s maturity, which may\ncause the Fund or an Underlying\nFund to have to reinvest in\nsecurities with lower yields or\nhigher risk of default, resulting\nin a decline in the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's income or\nreturn potential. Also, if a\nsecurity subject to prepayment\nhad been purchased at a premium,\nthe value of the premium would be\nlost in the event of prepayment.\nPrivatization Risk. Some\ncountries in which the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund invests have\nprivatized, or have begun the\nprocess of privatizing, certain\nentities and industries. Newly\nprivatized companies may face\nstrong competition from\ngovernment-sponsored competitors\nthat have not been privatized. In\nsome instances, investors in\nnewly privatized entities have\nsuffered losses due to the\ninability of the newly privatized\nentities to adjust quickly to a\ncompetitive environment or\nchanging regulatory and legal\nstandards or, in some cases, due\nto re-nationalization of such\nprivatized entities. There is no\nassurance that similar losses\nwill not recur. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk. The\neconomies of many countries or\nregions in which certain of the\nUnderlying Funds invest are\nhighly dependent on trade with\ncertain key trading partners.\nReduction in spending on products\nand services by these key trading\npartners, institution of tariffs\nor other trade barriers or a\nslowdown in the economies of key\ntrading partners may adversely\naffect the performance of any\ncompany in which such Underlying\nFunds invest and may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nUnderlying Funds' performance.\nRisk of Investing in Emerging\nMarkets. Investments in emerging\nmarket issuers are subject to a\ngreater risk of loss than\ninvestments in issuers located or\noperating in more developed\nmarkets. This is due to, among\nother things, the potential for\ngreater market volatility, lower\ntrading volume, higher levels of\ninflation, social, political or\neconomic instability, greater\nrisk of a market shutdown and\nmore governmental 27 limitations\non foreign investments in\nemerging market countries than\nare typically found in more\ndeveloped markets. Some countries\nin which the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may invest may\nexperience economic instability,\nincluding instability resulting\nfrom substantial rates of\ninflation or significant\ndevaluations of their currency,\nor economic recessions, which\nwould have a negative effect on\nthe economies and securities\nmarkets of their economies. Some\nof these countries may also\nimpose restrictions on the\nexchange or export of currency or\nadverse currency exchange rates\nand may be characterized by a\nlack of available currency\nhedging instruments. Disparities\nof wealth, the pace and success\nof democratization and ethnic,\nreligious and racial\ndisaffection, among other\nfactors, may exacerbate social\nunrest, violence and labor unrest\nin some of the countries in which\nthe Fund may invest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political\nor social developments may result\nin sudden and significant\ninvestment losses. Companies in\nmany emerging markets are not\nsubject to the same degree of\nregulatory requirements,\naccounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more\ndeveloped countries, and as a\nresult, information about the\nsecurities in which the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund invests may be\nless reliable or complete.\nMoreover, emerging markets often\nhave less reliable securities\nvaluations and greater risks\nassociated with custody of\nsecurities than developed\nmarkets. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining\ninformation necessary for\ninvestigations into or litigation\nagainst companies and\nshareholders may have limited\nlegal remedies. The Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds are not actively\nmanaged and do not select\ninvestments based on investor\nprotection considerations. In\naddition, emerging markets often\nhave greater risk of capital\ncontrols through such measures as\ntaxes or interest rate control\nthan developed markets. Certain\nemerging market countries may\nalso lack the infrastructure\nnecessary to attract large\namounts of foreign trade and\ninvestment. Chronic structural\npublic sector deficits in some\ncountries in which the Fund may\ninvest may adversely impact\nsecurities held by the Fund.\nLocal securities markets in\nemerging market countries may\ntrade a small number of\nsecurities and may be unable to\nrespond effectively to changes in\ntrading volume, potentially\nmaking prompt liquidation of\nholdings difficult or impossible\nat times. Settlement procedures\nin emerging market countries are\nfrequently less developed and\nreliable than those in the U.S.\n(and other developed countries).\nIn addition, significant delays\nmay occur in certain markets in\nregistering the transfer of\nsecurities. Settlement or\nregistration problems may make it\nmore difficult for the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund to value its\nportfolio securities and could\nhave an adverse effect on the\nFund or an Underlying Fund in\nseeking to achieve its investment\nobjective. Investing in emerging\nmarket countries involves a\nhigher risk of loss due to\nexpropriation, nationalization,\nconfiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of\nrestrictions on foreign\ninvestments and on repatriation\nof capital invested in certain\nemerging market countries. As a\nresult, investments in certain\ncountries in which the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may invest may be\nsubject to loss due to\nexpropriation or 28\nnationalization of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of\nrestrictions on foreign\ninvestments and repatriation of\ncapital. Risk of Investing in\nFrontier Markets. Frontier\nmarkets are those emerging\nmarkets considered to be among\nthe smallest, least mature and\nthe securities of the issuers of\nwhich are the least liquid.\nInvestments in frontier markets\ngenerally are subject to a\ngreater risk of loss than\ninvestments in developed markets\nor traditional emerging markets.\nThis is due to, among other\nthings, smaller economies, less\ndeveloped capital markets,\ngreater market volatility, lower\ntrading volume, political and\neconomic instability, greater\nrisk of a market shutdown,\ncapital controls, delays or\nlimits on repatriation of local\ncurrency, insolvency of local\ngovernments, and more\ngovernmental limitations on\nforeign investments than\ntypically found in more developed\nmarkets. Frontier markets are\neven more prone to economic\nshocks associated with political\nand economic risks than are\nemerging markets generally. Many\nfrontier market countries may be\ndependent on commodities, foreign\ntrade or foreign aid. As a\nresult, those risks traditionally\nassociated with investments in\nemerging markets may be more\npronounced with respect to\ninvestments in frontier market\neconomies. Risk of Investing in\nRussia. Investing in Russian\nsecurities involves significant\nrisks, in addition to those\ndescribed under \u201c Risk of\nInvesting in Emerging Markets \u201d\nand \u201c Non-U.S. Securities Risk, \u201d\nthat are not typically associated\nwith investing in U.S.\nsecurities, including: \u25a0 The risk\nof delays in settling portfolio\ntransactions and the risk of loss\narising out of the system of\nshare registration and custody\nused in Russia; \u25a0 Risks in\nconnection with the maintenance\nof a Fund\u2019s portfolio securities\nand cash with foreign sub-\ncustodians and securities\ndepositories, including the risk\nthat appropriate sub-custody\narrangements will not be\navailable to a Fund; \u25a0 The risk\nthat a Fund\u2019s ownership rights in\nportfolio securities could be\nlost through fraud or negligence\nbecause ownership in shares of\nRussian companies is recorded by\nthe companies themselves and by\nregistrars, rather than by a\ncentral registration system; \u25a0\nThe risk that a Fund may not be\nable to pursue claims on behalf\nof its shareholders because of\nthe system of share registration\nand custody, and because Russian\nbanking institutions and\nregistrars are not guaranteed by\nthe Russian government; and \u25a0 The\nrisk that various responses by\nother nation-states to alleged\nRussian cyber activity will\nimpact Russia\u2019s economy and\nRussian issuers of securities in\nwhich a Fund invests. Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine . Russia\nlaunched a large-scale invasion\nof Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\nThe extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting\nsanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and\nthe value of the ruble against\nthe U.S. dollar, are impossible\nto predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused\nby Russian military action or\nother actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or\nresulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity,\nincluding purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts\nor changes in consumer or\npurchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions,\ntariffs 29 or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian\ncompanies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact\nRussia\u2019s economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which a Fund\ninvests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian\nmilitary action may also impact\nthe markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and\nnatural gas, as well as other\nsectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across\nEurope and globally. Russia\nSanctions. Governments, including\nthe U.S., the E.U., the U.K, and\nmany other countries\n(collectively, the \u201c Sanctioning\nBodies \u201d ) have imposed economic\nsanctions on certain Russian\nindividuals, including\npoliticians, and Russian\ncorporate and banking entities,\nincluding banning Russia from\nglobal payments systems that\nfacilitate cross-border payments.\nIn an effort to curtail Russia\u2019s\nability to finance its war\neffort, the Sanctioning Bodies\ncontinue to elevate these\nmeasures and may, going forward,\ninstitute broader sanctions on\nRussia. These sanctions, or even\nthe threat of further sanctions,\nmay result in the decline of the\nvalue and liquidity of Russian\nsecurities, a weakening of the\nruble or other adverse\nconsequences to the Russian\neconomy. These sanctions could\nalso result in the immediate\nfreeze of Russian securities\nand/or funds invested in\nprohibited assets, impairing the\nability of a Fund to buy, sell,\nreceive or deliver those\nsecurities and/or assets. The\nsanctions against certain Russian\nissuers include broad asset\nfreezes and prohibitions on\ntransacting or otherwise dealing\nin select issuances of debt or\nequity of such issuers, among\nothers. Compliance with each of\nthese sanctions measures has\nimpaired, and may continue to\nimpair, the ability of a Fund to\nbuy, sell, hold, receive or\ndeliver the affected securities\nor other securities of such\nissuers. A Fund may also be\nlegally required to block (i.e.,\nfreeze) assets in a blocked\naccount and report the\naccompanying exposure to\nSanctioning Bodies. Sanctions\nhave resulted in Russia taking\ncounter measures or retaliatory\nactions, which has impaired the\nvalue and liquidity of Russian\nsecurities. These retaliatory\nmeasures include the immediate\nfreeze of Russian assets held by\na Fund. Due to the freeze of\nthese assets, including\ndepositary receipts, a Fund may\nneed to liquidate non-restricted\nassets in order to satisfy any\nFund redemption orders. The\nliquidation of Fund assets during\nthis time may also result in the\nFund receiving substantially\nlower prices for its securities.\nRussia may implement additional\nretaliatory measures, which may\nfurther impair the value and\nliquidity of Russian securities\nand the ability of a Fund to\nreceive dividend payments. Russia\nhas issued a number of\ncountersanctions, some of which\nrestrict the distribution of\nprofits by limited liability\ncompanies (e.g., dividends), and\nprohibits Russian persons from\nentering into transactions with\ndesignated persons from \u201c\nunfriendly states \u201d as well as\nthe export of raw materials or\nother products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons.\nRussian companies may be unable\nto pay dividends and, if they pay\ndividends, a Fund may be unable\nto receive them. These sanctions,\nthe decision by Russia to suspend\ntrading on the Moscow Exchange\n(MOEX) and prohibit non-resident\ninvestors from executing security\nsales, and other events have led\nindex providers to remove Russian\nsecurities from indexes. Each\nFund is currently restricted from\ntrading in Russian securities,\nincluding those in its portfolio\n30 (if any), and the Underlying\nIndexes have removed Russian\nsecurities (if any). This\ndisparity will also lead to\nincreased tracking error. The\ninability of a Fund to trade in\nRussian securities may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s ability to meet\nits investment objective. It is\nunknown when, or if, sanctions\nmay be lifted or a Fund\u2019s ability\nto trade in Russian securities\nwill resume. Sovereign and Quasi-\nSovereign Obligations Risk. An\ninvestment in sovereign or quasi-\nsovereign debt obligations\ninvolves special risks not\npresent in corporate debt\nobligations. Sovereign debt\nincludes securities issued by or\nguaranteed by a foreign sovereign\ngovernment, and quasi-sovereign\ndebt includes securities issued\nby or guaranteed by an entity\naffiliated with or backed by a\nsovereign government. The issuer\nof the sovereign debt that\ncontrols the repayment of the\ndebt may be unable or unwilling\nto repay principal or interest\nwhen due, and the Fund or\nUnderlying Funds may have limited\nrecourse in the event of a\ndefault. Similar to other\nissuers, changes to the financial\ncondition or credit rating of a\ngovernment may cause the value of\na sovereign debt obligation,\nincluding U.S. Treasury\nobligations, to decline. During\nperiods of economic uncertainty,\nthe market prices of sovereign\ndebt may be more volatile than\nprices of U.S. debt obligations\nand may affect the Fund's or\nUnderlying Fund's NAV. Quasi-\nsovereign debt obligations are\ntypically less liquid and less\nstandardized than sovereign debt\nobligations. In the past, certain\nemerging market countries have\nencountered difficulties in\nservicing their debt obligations,\nwithheld payments of principal\nand interest and declared\nmoratoria on the payment of\nprincipal and interest on their\nsovereign debts. Several\ncountries in which the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund invests have\ndefaulted on their sovereign debt\nobligations in the past or\nencountered downgrades of their\nsovereign debt obligations, and\nthose countries (or other\ncountries) may default or risk\nfurther downgrades in the future.\nTelecommunications Sector Risk.\nThe telecommunications sector is\nsubject to extensive government\nregulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental\nregulations, delays or failure to\nreceive required regulatory\napprovals, or the enactment of\nnew regulatory requirements may\nnegatively affect the business of\ntelecommunications companies in\nwhich the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds invest. Government actions\naround the world, specifically in\nthe area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices,\ncan be arbitrary and\nunpredictable. The domestic\ntelecommunications market is\ncharacterized by increasing\ncompetition and regulation by\nvarious state and federal\nregulatory authorities. Companies\nin the telecommunications sector\nmay encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit\nsubstantial capital to meet\nincreasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new\ntechnology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products\nand services of certain\ntelecommunications companies\nobsolete. Telecommunications\nproviders are generally required\nto obtain franchises or licenses\nin order to provide services in a\ngiven location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the\ntelecommunications sector are\nlimited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain\nparticipants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high\nbarriers to market entry and\nregulatory oversight, among other\nfactors, have led to\nconsolidation of companies within\nthe sector, which could lead to\nfurther regulation or other\nnegative effects in the future.\n31 Threshold/Underinvestment\nRisk. If certain aggregate and/or\nfund-level ownership thresholds\nare reached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates\nor the Fund, or as a result of\nthird-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or\nregulator, the ability of BFA and\nits affiliates on behalf of\nclients (including the Fund) to\npurchase or dispose of\ninvestments, or exercise rights\nor undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted\nby regulation or otherwise\nimpaired. The capacity of the\nFund to make investments in\ncertain securities may be\naffected by the relevant\nthreshold limits, and such\nlimitations may have adverse\neffects on the liquidity and\nperformance of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings compared to\nthe performance of the Underlying\nIndex. This may increase the risk\nof the Fund being underinvested\nto the Underlying Index and\nincrease the risk of tracking\nerror. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Fund\ninvests in securities issued by\ncompanies that operate in certain\nregulated industries or in\ncertain emerging or international\nmarkets, is subject to corporate\nor regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invests in\ncertain futures or other\nderivative transactions, there\nmay be limits on the aggregate\nand/or fund-level amount invested\nor voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts\n(including the Fund) that may not\nbe exceeded without the grant of\na license or other regulatory or\ncorporate consent or, if\nexceeded, may cause BFA and its\naffiliates, the Fund or other\nclient accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business\nrestrictions. U.S. Agency Debt\nRisk. Unsecured bonds or\ndebentures issued by the U.S.\ngovernment or one of its agencies\nor sponsored entities help\nfinance U.S. governmental\npolicies and public missions, but\nmay be backed only by the general\ncreditworthiness and reputation\nof the U.S. government agency or\ngovernment sponsored entity and\nnot the full faith and credit of\nthe U.S. government. For example,\ndebt issued by the Federal\nNational Mortgage Association ( \u201c\nFannie Mae \u201d ), the Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corporation ( \u201c\nFreddie Mac \u201d ) and the Federal\nHome Loan Banks provides\nfinancing, credit, and/or\nliquidity to the housing and\nmortgage markets, and is not\nbacked by the full faith and\ncredit of the U.S. government. In\naddition, debt issued by the TVA,\nwhich provides electricity\ngeneration and flood control in\nparts of the Southeast region of\nthe U.S., and the Federal Farm\nCredit Banks, which provide\ncredit and related services to\nthe agricultural sector, is not\nbacked by the full faith and\ncredit of the U.S. government.\nGinnie Mae securities and certain\nforeign government debt issuances\nguaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, including certain\nissuances by Iraq and Israel, are\nbacked by the full faith and\ncredit of the U.S. government.\nBonds or debentures that do not\ncarry the backing of the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment are subject to more\ncredit risk than securities that\nare supported by the full faith\nand credit of the U.S.\ngovernment. If a U.S. government\nagency or sponsored entity that\nis the issuer of securities in\nwhich the Fund or an Underlying\nFund invests is unable to meet\nits obligations or ceases to\nexist and no plan is made for\nrepayment of securities, the\nperformance of the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund will be adversely\naffected. There can be no\nassurance that the U.S.\ngovernment would provide\nfinancial support to any of these\nU.S. governmental agencies or\nsponsored entities if it is not\nobligated to do so. In 2008,\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac were\nplaced under the conservatorship\nof the U.S. government, which\nprovided financial support to the\nU.S. 32 government-sponsored\nentities. However, there can be\nno assurance that such past U.S.\ngovernment support will result in\nsupport in the future. Any actual\nor potential disruption to a U.S.\ngovernment agency or sponsored\nentity, or the financial\ncondition or credit of the U.S.\ngovernment, could cause the value\nof U.S. agency debt to decline.\nU.S. Agency Mortgage-Backed\nSecurities Risk. Certain\nUnderlying Funds invest in\nsecurities backed by pools of\nmortgages issued or guaranteed by\nthe U.S. government or one of its\nagencies or sponsored entities,\nincluding the Government National\nMortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie\nMae \u201d ), Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac. While securities guaranteed\nby Ginnie Mae are backed by the\nfull faith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment, securities issued by\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are\nnot backed by the full faith and\ncredit of the U.S. government,\nand there can be no assurance\nthat the U.S. government would\nprovide financial support to its\nagencies or sponsored entities\nwhere it is not obligated to do\nso. Bonds or debentures that do\nnot carry the backing of the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment are subject to more\ncredit risk than securities that\nare supported by the full faith\nand credit of the U.S.\ngovernment. To the extent that\nthe U.S. government has provided\nsupport to a U.S. agency or\nsponsored entity in the past,\nthere can be no assurance that\nthe U.S. government will provide\nsupport in the future if it is\nnot obligated to do so. If a U.S.\ngovernment agency or sponsored\nentity that is the issuer of\nsecurities in which an Underlying\nFund invests is unable to meet\nits obligations or ceases to\nexist and no plan is made for\nrepayment of securities, the\nperformance of an Underlying Fund\nwill be adversely affected.\nMortgage-backed securities ( \u201c\nMBS \u201d ) represent interests in \u201c\npools \u201d of mortgages and, due to\nthe nature of these loans they\nrepresent, are subject to\nprepayment and extension risk.\nPrepayment risk is the risk that,\nduring periods of falling\ninterest rates, an issuer of\nmortgages and other fixed-income\nsecurities may be able to repay\nprincipal prior to the security\u2019s\nmaturity. This may cause an\nUnderlying Fund to have to\nreinvest in securities with a\nlower yield or higher risk of\ndefault, resulting in a decline\nin an Underlying Fund's income or\nreturn potential. MBS are also\nsubject to extension risk, which\nis the risk that when interest\nrates rise, certain MBS will be\npaid off substantially more\nslowly than originally\nanticipated and the value of\nthose securities may fall\nsharply, resulting in a decline\nin income and potentially in the\nvalue of the investment. Because\nof prepayment and extension\nrisks, MBS react differently to\nchanges in interest rates than\nother bonds. Small movements in\ninterest rates (both increases\nand decreases) may quickly and\nsignificantly reduce the value of\ncertain MBS. These securities are\nalso subject to the risk of\ndefault on the underlying\nmortgage loans, particularly\nduring periods of economic\ndownturn. Certain Underlying\nFunds seek to obtain exposure to\nthe fixed-rate portion of U.S.\nagency mortgage pass-through\nsecurities primarily through TBA\nsecurities, or TBA transactions.\nTBAs refer to a commonly used\nmechanism for the forward\nsettlement of U.S. agency MBS,\nand not to a separate type of\nMBS. Default or bankruptcy of a\ncounterparty to a TBA transaction\nwould expose the Fund to possible\nlosses because of adverse market\naction, expenses or delays in\nconnection with the purchase or\nsale of the pools of mortgage\npass-through securities specified\nin the TBA transaction. 33 The\nFund intends to invest cash\npending settlement of TBA\ntransactions in money market\ninstruments, repurchase\nagreements, or other high\nquality, liquid short-term\ninstruments, including money\nmarket funds advised by BFA. The\nFund will pay its pro rata share\nof fees and expenses of any money\nmarket fund that it may invest\nin, in addition to the Fund\u2019s own\nfees and expenses. U.S. Economic\nRisk. The U.S. is a significant,\nand in some cases the most\nsignificant, trading partner of,\nor foreign investor in, certain\ncountry or countries in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests. As a\nresult, economic conditions of\nsuch countries may be\nparticularly affected by changes\nin the U.S. economy. A decrease\nin U.S. imports or exports, new\ntrade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S.\ndollar exchange rate or an\neconomic slowdown in the U.S. may\nhave a material adverse effect on\nthe economic conditions of such\ncountries and, as a result,\nsecurities to which an Underlying\nFund has exposure. Circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or\nprincipal on U.S. government\ndebt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. U.S.\nGovernment Issuers Risk.\nObligations of U.S. government\nagencies and authorities are\nsupported by varying degrees of\ncredit but generally are not\nbacked by the full faith and\ncredit of the U.S. government.\nBonds or debentures that do not\ncarry the backing of the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment are subject to more\ncredit risk than securities that\nare supported by the full faith\nand credit of the U.S.\ngovernment. To the extent that\nthe U.S. government has provided\nsupport to a U.S. agency or\nsponsored entity in the past,\nthere can be no assurance that\nthe U.S. government will provide\nsupport in the future if it is\nnot obligated to do so. If a U.S.\ngovernment agency or sponsored\nentity that is the issuer of\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests is unable to meet its\nobligations or ceases to exist\nand no plan is made for repayment\nof securities, the performance of\nthe Fund will be adversely\naffected. Similar to other\nissuers, changes to the financial\ncondition or credit rating of the\nU.S. government or U.S.\ngovernment agencies and\nauthorities may cause the value\nof the Fund's investments to\ndecline. U.S. Treasury securities\nare rated AA+ by S&P Global\nRatings. A downgrade of the\nrating of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities may cause the value of\nthe Fund's or an Underlying\nFund's U.S. Treasury obligations\nto decline. Because U.S.\ngovernment debt obligations are\noften used as a benchmark for\nother borrowing arrangements, a\ndowngrade could also result in\nhigher interest rates for a range\nof borrowers, cause disruptions\nin the international bond markets\nand have a substantial adverse\neffect on the U.S. and global\neconomy. A high national debt\nlevel may increase market\npressures to meet government\nfunding needs, which may drive\ndebt cost higher and lead the\ngovernment to issue additional\ndebt, thereby increasing\nrefinancing risk. A high national\ndebt also raises concerns that\nthe U.S. government will not be\nable to make principal or\ninterest payments when they are\ndue. If market participants\ndetermine that U.S. sovereign\ndebt levels have become\nunsustainable, the value of the\nU.S. dollar could decline, thus\nincreasing inflationary\npressures, particularly with\nrespect to services outsourced to\nnon-U.S. providers and imported\ngoods, and constrain or prevent\nthe U.S. government from\nimplementing effective\ncountercyclical fiscal policy in\neconomic downturns. Direct\nobligations of the 34 U.S.\nTreasury have historically\ninvolved little risk of loss of\nprincipal if held to maturity.\nHowever, due to fluctuations in\ninterest rates, the market value\nof such securities may vary\nduring the period that\nshareholders own shares of the\nFund. Notwithstanding that U.S.\nTreasury obligations are backed\nby the full faith and credit of\nthe United States, circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or\nprincipal, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nlosses to the Fund and\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system. U.S.\nTreasury Obligations Risk. U.S.\nTreasury obligations may differ\nfrom other securities in their\ninterest rates, maturities, times\nof issuance and other\ncharacteristics. Similar to other\nissuers, changes to the financial\ncondition or credit rating of the\nU.S. government may cause the\nvalue of the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. U.S.\nTreasury securities are rated AA+\nby S&P Global Ratings. A\ndowngrade of the rating of U.S.\nTreasury securities may cause the\nvalue of the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Because\nU.S. government debt obligations\nare often used as a benchmark for\nother borrowing arrangements, a\ndowngrade could also result in\nhigher interest rates for a range\nof borrowers, cause disruptions\nin the international bond markets\nand have a substantial adverse\neffect on the U.S. and global\neconomy. A high national debt\nlevel may increase market\npressures to meet government\nfunding needs, which may drive\ndebt cost higher and lead the\ngovernment to issue additional\ndebt, thereby increasing\nrefinancing risk. A high national\ndebt also raises concerns that\nthe U.S. government will not be\nable to make principal or\ninterest payments when they are\ndue. If market participants\ndetermine that U.S. sovereign\ndebt levels have become\nunsustainable, the value of the\nU.S. dollar could decline, thus\nincreasing inflationary\npressures, particularly with\nrespect to services outsourced to\nnon-U.S. providers and imported\ngoods, and constrain or prevent\nthe U.S. government from\nimplementing effective\ncountercyclical fiscal policy in\neconomic downturns. Direct\nobligations of the U.S. Treasury\nhave historically involved little\nrisk of loss of principal if held\nto maturity. However, due to\nfluctuations in interest rates,\nthe market value of such\nsecurities may vary during the\nperiod that shareholders own\nshares of the Fund.\nNotwithstanding that U.S.\nTreasury obligations are backed\nby the full faith and credit of\nthe United States, circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or\nprincipal, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nlosses to the Fund and\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system.\nPortfolio Holdings Information A\ndescription of the Trust's\npolicies and procedures with\nrespect to the disclosure of the\nFund\u2019s portfolio securities is\navailable in the Fund's Statement\nof Additional Information ( \u201c SAI\n\u201d ).

In addition to\ninvesting in the Underlying\nFunds, the Fund may borrow, lend\nits portfolio securities to\nbrokers, dealers and financial\ninstitutions, and may invest the\ncollateral in certain short-term\ninstruments, either directly or\nthrough one or more money market\nfunds, as described in greater\ndetail in the Fund's SAI. Certain\nUnderlying Funds may invest in\nnon-U.S. securities, emerging\nmarkets securities and debt\ninstruments, which are subject to\nadditional risks, as described in\nthis Prospectus and in the Fund's\nSAI. The investment model for the\nUnderlying Index is intended to\nrepresent a fixed income\nallocation strategy designed to\ndeliver high current income. The\nUnderlying Funds The Fund seeks\nto track the investment results\nof an index composed of\nunderlying fixed-income funds\nthat collectively seek to deliver\nhigh current income. Each\nUnderlying Fund generally holds\nassets that form a subset of the\nsecurities composing the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund's\nallocation of assets to the\nUnderlying Funds will generally\nclosely reflect the allocation\nweights represented in the\nUnderlying Index. The following\ntable lists the Fund's\ninvestments and asset allocation\nin each Underlying Fund as of\nSeptember 23, 2024. BFA allocates\nthe Fund\u2019s assets among the\nUnderlying Funds in accordance\nwith the Fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and policies. Any\nremaining assets are allocated to\nthe BlackRock Cash Funds. BFA is\nnot required to invest the Fund\u2019s\nassets in all of the Underlying\nFunds or in any particular\npercentage in any given\nUnderlying Fund.

In managing\ncertain of the Underlying Funds,\nBFA uses a representative\nsampling index strategy.\nRepresentative sampling is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively have an investment\nprofile similar to a specified\nbenchmark index. Securities\nselected for the Underlying Funds\nare expected to have, in the\naggregate, investment\ncharacteristics (based on factors\nsuch as market capitalization and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to\nthose of the applicable\nunderlying index. The Underlying\nFunds may or may not hold all of\nthe securities that are included\nin their respective underlying\nindexes and may hold certain\nsecurities that are not included\nin their respective underlying\nindexes. Additional information\nregarding the Underlying Funds\nand their principal investment\nstrategies is provided below. The\niShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond\nETF seeks to track the investment\nresults of the ICE \u00ae 0-3 Month US\nTreasury Securities Index, which\nmeasures the performance of\npublic obligations of the U.S.\nTreasury that have a remaining\nmaturity of less than or equal to\nthree months. As of February 29,\n2024, there were 37 components in\nthe ICE 0-3 Month US Treasury\nSecurities Index. The ICE 0-3\nMonth US Treasury Securities\nIndex is market value weighted\nbased on amounts outstanding of\nissuances consisting of publicly\nissued U.S. Treasury securities\nthat have a remaining term to\nfinal maturity of less than or\nequal to three months as of the\nrebalance date and $1 billion or\nmore of outstanding face value,\nexcluding amounts held by the\nFederal Reserve System Open\nMarket Account. In addition, the\nsecurities in the ICE 0-3 Month\nUS Treasury Securities Index must\nhave a fixed coupon schedule and\nbe denominated in U.S. dollars.\nExcluded from the ICE 0-3 Month\nUS Treasury Securities Index are\ninflation-linked securities and\nzero-coupon bonds that have been\nstripped from coupon-paying bonds\n( e.g ., Separate Trading of\nRegistered Interest and Principal\nof Securities). However, the\namounts outstanding of qualifying\ncoupon securities in the ICE 0-3\nMonth US Treasury Securities\nIndex are not reduced by any\nindividual components of such\nsecurities ( i.e ., coupon or\nprincipal) that have been\nstripped after inclusion in the\nICE 0-3 Month US Treasury\nSecurities Index. The ICE 0-3\nMonth US Treasury Securities\nIndex is rebalanced on the last\ncalendar day of each month. The\nICE 0-3 Month US Treasury\nSecurities Index does not provide\nfor the reinvestment of cash\nflows from coupon payments or the\nproceeds of maturing component 37\nsecurities between rebalance\ndates. Consequently, the iShares\n0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF may\nhold money market instruments.\nThe iShares 10+ Year Investment\nGrade Corporate Bond ETF seeks to\ntrack the investment results of\nthe ICE \u00ae BofA \u00ae 10+ Year US\nCorporate Index, which measures\nthe performance of investment-\ngrade corporate bonds of both\nU.S. and non-U.S. issuers that\nare U.S. dollar-denominated and\npublicly issued in the U.S.\ndomestic market and have a\nremaining maturity of greater\nthan or equal to ten years. As of\nFebruary 29, 2024, there were\n3,653 issues in the ICE BofA 10+\nYear US Corporate Index. As of\nFebruary 29, 2024, a significant\nportion of the ICE BofA 10+ Year\nUS Corporate Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the\nconsumer staples, financials,\nhealthcare, telecommunications\nand utilities industries or\nsectors. The components of the\nICE BofA 10+ Year US Corporate\nIndex are likely to change over\ntime. The ICE BofA 10+ Year US\nCorporate Index consists of\ninvestment-grade corporate bonds\nof both U.S. and non-U.S. issuers\nthat have a remaining maturity of\ngreater than or equal to ten\nyears, have been publicly issued\nin the U.S. domestic market, and\nhave $250 million or more of\noutstanding face value. IDI deems\nsecurities as \u201c investment grade\n\u201d based on the average rating of\nFitch Ratings, Inc. (BBB or\nbetter), Moody\u2019s Investors\nService, Inc. (Baa or better)\nand/or Standard & Poor's \u00ae\nFinancial Services LLC, a\nsubsidiary of S&P Global (BBB or\nbetter). In addition, the\nsecurities in the ICE BofA 10+\nYear US Corporate Index must be\ndenominated in U.S. dollars and\nmust be fixed-rate. Excluded from\nthe ICE BofA 10+ Year US\nCorporate Index are equity-linked\nsecurities, securities in legal\ndefault, hybrid securitized\ncorporate bonds, Eurodollar bonds\n(U.S. dollar-denominated\nsecurities not issued in the U.S.\ndomestic market), taxable and\ntax-exempt U.S. municipal\nsecurities and dividends-\nreceived-deduction-eligible\nsecurities. The ICE BofA 10+ Year\nUS Corporate Index is market\ncapitalization-weighted, and the\nsecurities in the ICE BofA 10+\nYear US Corporate Index are\nupdated on the last calendar day\nof each month. Under normal\ncircumstances, the iShares 10+\nYear Investment Grade Corporate\nBond ETF will seek to maintain a\nweighted average maturity that is\ngreater than ten years. Weighted\naverage maturity is a U.S.\ndollar-weighted average of the\nremaining term to maturity of the\nunderlying securities in the\niShares 10+ Year Investment Grade\nCorporate Bond ETF's portfolio.\nThe iShares Broad USD High Yield\nCorporate Bond ETF seeks to track\nthe investment results of the ICE\nBofA US High Yield Constrained\nIndex, which is a rules-based\nindex consisting of U.S. dollar-\ndenominated, high yield (as\ndetermined by IDI) corporate\nbonds publicly issued and settled\nin the U.S. The ICE BofA US High\nYield Constrained Index is\ndesigned to provide a broad\nrepresentation of the U.S.\ndollar-denominated high yield\ncorporate bond market. The ICE\nBofA US High Yield Constrained\nIndex is a modified market value-\nweighted index with a cap on each\nissuer of 2%. There is no limit\nto the number of issues in the\nICE BofA US High Yield\nConstrained Index, but as of\nOctober 31, 2023, the ICE BofA US\nHigh Yield Constrained Index\nincluded approximately 1,854\nconstituents and the issuers in\nthe ICE BofA US High Yield\nConstrained Index are principally\nlocated in the U.S. The\ncomponents of the ICE BofA US\nHigh Yield Constrained Index are\nlikely to change over time. 38 As\nof the date of iShares Broad USD\nHigh Yield Corporate Bond ETF\u2019s\nProspectus, the bonds eligible\nfor inclusion in the ICE BofA US\nHigh Yield Constrained Index\ninclude U.S. dollar-denominated\nhigh yield corporate bonds that:\n(i) are issued by companies\nhaving \u201c risk exposure \u201d to\ncountries ( i.e ., issuers that\nare subject to the risks of one\nor more of these countries as a\nresult of the principal country\nof domicile of the issuers (as\ndetermined by IDI)) that are\nmembers of the FX-G10, which\ninclude Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Cyprus, Estonia,\nFinland, France, Germany, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Japan, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPortugal, Slovakia, Slovenia,\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, the\nU.K. and the U.S. and their\nrespective territories; (ii) have\nan average rating of below\ninvestment grade (ratings from\nFitch, Moody's or S&P Global\nRatings are considered; if more\nthan one agency provides a\nrating, the average rating is\nattached to the bond); (iii) are\nregistered with the SEC, exempt\nfrom registration at issuance, or\noffered pursuant to Rule 144A\nunder the 1933 Act, with or\nwithout registration rights; (iv)\nhave at least $250 million of\noutstanding face value; (v) have\nan original maturity date of at\nleast 18 months; and (vi) have at\nleast one year to maturity. The\niShares CMBS ETF seeks to track\nthe investment results of the\nBloomberg U.S. CMBS (ERISA Only)\nIndex, which measures the\nperformance of investment-grade\n(as determined by Bloomberg)\nCMBS, which are classes of\nsecurities (known as \u201c\ncertificates \u201d ) that represent\ninterests in \u201c pools \u201d of\ncommercial mortgages. The\nBloomberg U.S. CMBS (ERISA Only)\nIndex includes only CMBS that are\nEmployee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act of 1974, as amended\n( \u201c ERISA \u201d ) eligible under the\nunderwriter\u2019s exemption, which\nwill deem ERISA eligible the\ncertificates with the first\npriority of principal repayment,\nas long as certain conditions are\nmet, including the requirement\nthat the certificates be rated in\none of the three highest rating\ncategories by Fitch, Moody's or\nS&P Global Ratings. The Bloomberg\nU.S. CMBS (ERISA Only) Index\nincludes investment-grade CMBS\nthat are ERISA eligible with $300\nmillion or more of aggregate\noutstanding transaction size. In\naddition, the original aggregate\ntransaction must be $500 million\nor more and the tranche size must\nbe $25 million or more. CMBS\ncertificates must have an\nexpected life of at least one\nyear and must be either fixed-\nrate or subject to an interest\nrate cap equal to the weighted\naverage coupon of the underlying\nasset pool. Excluded from the\nBloomberg U.S. CMBS (ERISA Only)\nIndex are non-ERISA eligible\nsecurities, agency transactions\nand privately issued securities,\nincluding those which may be\nresold in accordance with Rule\n144A under the 1933 Act. The\nsecurities in the Bloomberg U.S.\nCMBS (ERISA Only) Index are\nupdated on the last calendar day\nof each month. The iShares\nFloating Rate Bond ETF seeks to\ntrack the investment results of\nthe Bloomberg US Floating Rate\nNote \u02c2 5 Years Index, which\nmeasures the performance of U.S.\ndollar-denominated, investment-\ngrade (as determined by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited) floating\nrate notes. Securities in the\nBloomberg US Floating Rate Note \u02c2\n5 Years Index have a remaining\nmaturity of greater than or equal\nto one month and less than five\nyears, and have $300 million or\nmore of outstanding face value.\nAs of October 31, 2023, a\nsignificant portion of the\nBloomberg US Floating Rate Note \u02c2\n5 Years Index is represented by\nsecurities of companies in the\nfinancials industry or sector. As\nof October 31, 2023, the\nBloomberg US Floating Rate Note \u02c2\n5 Years Index 39 was composed of\nsecurities of companies in the\nfollowing countries or regions:\nAustralia, Canada, China,\nFinland, France, Germany, Japan,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Singapore, South Korea,\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, the\nU.K. and the U.S. The components\nof the Bloomberg US Floating Rate\nNote \u02c2 5 Years Index are likely\nto change over time. The\nBloomberg US Floating Rate Note \u02c2\n5 Years Index consists of debt\ninstruments that pay a variable\ncoupon rate, based on a reference\nrate such as the 3-month London\nInterbank Offered Rate or the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate\nand a fixed spread. The Bloomberg\nUS Floating Rate Note \u02c2 5 Years\nIndex is market capitalization-\nweighted and the securities in\nthe Bloomberg US Floating Rate\nNote \u02c2 5 Years Index are updated\non the last calendar day of each\nmonth. The Bloomberg US Floating\nRate Note \u02c2 5 Years Index may\ninclude U.S. registered, dollar-\ndenominated bonds of non-U.S.\ncorporations, governments and\nsupranational entities. The\niShares J.P. Morgan EM High Yield\nBond ETF seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the J.P.\nMorgan USD Emerging Markets High\nYield Bond Index, which tracks\nthe performance of below\ninvestment-grade U.S. dollar-\ndenominated, emerging market\nfixed and floating-rate debt\nsecurities issued by corporate,\nsovereign, and quasi-sovereign\nentities. The J.P. Morgan USD\nEmerging Markets High Yield Bond\nIndex includes securities that\nare classified as below\ninvestment-grade, also referred\nto as \u201c high yield \u201d (as\ndetermined by JPMorgan Chase &\nCo.), in the established J.P.\nMorgan EMBI Global Diversified\nCore and J.P. Morgan CEMBI Broad\nDiversified Core indices, and\ncombines them with a market value\nbased weighting. High yield bonds\nare also known as \u201c junk bonds. \u201d\nAn instrument is classified as\nhigh yield when the middle rating\nfrom Moody\u2019s, S&P Global Ratings,\nand Fitch (each a \u201c Credit Rating\nAgency \u201d and collectively, the \u201c\nCredit Rating Agencies \u201d ) is\nbelow investment-grade. When a\ncredit rating is only available\nfrom two Credit Rating Agencies,\nthe lower of the two must be\nbelow investment-grade. When only\none Credit Rating Agency rates an\ninstrument, that rating is used.\nAll instruments included in the\nJ.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets\nHigh Yield Bond Index are\nselected according to rules-based\ninclusion criteria regarding\namount outstanding, issuer type,\nand maturity, among others. The\nsecurities included in the J.P.\nMorgan USD Emerging Markets High\nYield Bond Index are rebalanced\non the last business day of each\nmonth. Bonds are eligible for\ninclusion in the J.P. Morgan USD\nEmerging Markets High Yield Bond\nIndex if (i) the issuer is\nheadquartered in an emerging\nmarket country, (ii) the issue is\n100% guaranteed by an entity\nwithin an emerging market\neconomy, or (iii) 100% of the\nissuer\u2019s operating assets are\nlocated within emerging market\neconomies. Corporate instruments\nwith a current face amount\noutstanding of $500 million or\nmore and with at least 2.5 years\nuntil maturity are considered for\ninclusion. Corporate entities\nmust be domiciled within Africa,\nAsia (excluding Japan), Eastern\nEurope, the Middle East, or Latin\nAmerica. Sovereign and quasi-\nsovereign instruments with a\ncurrent face amount outstanding\nof $1 billion or more and with at\nleast 2.5 years until maturity\nare considered for inclusion.\nQuasi-sovereign entities are\ndefined by the JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. as an entity that is 100%\nguaranteed or 100% government\nowned. All eligible component\nsecurities may remain in the J.P.\nMorgan USD Emerging Markets High\nYield Bond Index until one year\nbefore maturity. 40 The J.P.\nMorgan EMBI Global Diversified\nCore and J.P. Morgan CEMBI Broad\nDiversified Core indices employ a\ndiversification methodology, as\ndetermined by the JPMorgan Chase\n& Co., which limits the weights\nof those index countries with\nlarger debt stock by only\nincluding a specified portion of\nsuch countries\u2019 eligible current\nface amounts of debt outstanding.\nThe methodology is designed to\ndistribute the weights of issuers\nin each country within the J.P.\nMorgan EMBI Global Diversified\nCore and J.P. Morgan CEMBI Broad\nDiversified Core indices by\nlimiting the weights of countries\nwith higher debt outstanding and\nreallocating this excess to\nissuers in countries with lower\ndebt outstanding. As of October\n31, 2023, the J.P. Morgan USD\nEmerging Markets High Yield Bond\nIndex included issuers located in\n64 countries. As of October 31,\n2023, a significant portion of\nthe J.P. Morgan USD Emerging\nMarkets High Yield Bond Index is\nrepresented by sovereign and\nquasi-sovereign obligations. The\ncomponents of the J.P. Morgan USD\nEmerging Markets High Yield Bond\nIndex are likely to change over\ntime. The iShares J.P. Morgan EM\nHigh Yield Bond ETF will invest\nin privately issued securities,\nincluding those that are normally\npurchased pursuant to Rule 144A\nor Regulation S promulgated under\nthe 1933 Act. Management\nInvestment Adviser. As investment\nadviser, BFA has overall\nresponsibility for the general\nmanagement and administration of\nthe Fund. BFA provides an\ninvestment program for the Fund\nand manages the investment of the\nFund\u2019s assets. In managing the\nFund, BFA may draw upon the\nresearch and expertise of its\nasset management affiliates with\nrespect to certain portfolio\nsecurities. In seeking to achieve\nthe Fund's investment objective,\nBFA uses teams of portfolio\nmanagers, investment strategists\nand other investment specialists.\nThis team approach brings\ntogether many disciplines and\nleverages BFA\u2019s extensive\nresources. Pursuant to the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nbetween BFA and the Trust\n(entered into on behalf of the\nFund), BFA is responsible for\nsubstantially all expenses of the\nFund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition\nof portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses\nand any extraordinary expenses\n(as determined by a majority of\nthe Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the\nTrust). Operating expenses paid\nby BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nif any. Pursuant to the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement,\nBFA is entitled to a management\nfee at the annual rate of 0.28%\nof the Fund's average daily net\nassets. For the fiscal year ended\nOctober 31, 2023, BFA was paid a\nmanagement fee from the Fund, as\na percentage of the Fund's\naverage daily net assets, net of\nany applicable waivers, at the\nannual rate of 0.00%. For the\nfiscal year ended October 31,\n2023, the Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses of the Fund amounted to\nan annual rate of 0.19%. BFA has\ncontractually agreed to waive its\nmanagement fees through February\n28, 2026. The contractual waiver\nmay be terminated prior to\nFebruary 28, 2026 only upon 41\nwritten agreement of the Trust\nand BFA. In addition, BFA may\nfrom time to time voluntarily\nwaive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses in order to limit total\nannual fund operating expenses\n(excluding Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses, if any). Any such\nvoluntary waiver or reimbursement\nmay be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime. BFA is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA\n94105. It is an indirect wholly-\nowned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ). As of\nDecember 31, 2023, BFA and its\naffiliates provided investment\nadvisory services for assets of\napproximately $10.0 trillion. BFA\nand its affiliates trade and\ninvest for their own accounts in\nthe actual securities and types\nof securities in which the Fund\nmay also invest, which may affect\nthe price of such securities. A\ndiscussion regarding the basis\nfor the approval by the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d\n) of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement with BFA is available\nin the Fund's Annual Report for\nthe period ended October 31.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer\nHsui, Greg Savage and Paul\nWhitehead are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. The\nPortfolio Managers are\nresponsible for various functions\nrelated to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninvesting cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of\ntheir respective portfolio\nmanagement teams to focus on\ncertain asset classes,\nimplementing investment strategy,\nresearching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and\noverseeing members of their\nrespective portfolio management\nteams who have more limited\nresponsibilities. Jennifer Hsui\nhas been employed by BFA or its\naffiliates as a senior portfolio\nmanager since 2007. Prior to\nthat, Ms. Hsui was a portfolio\nmanager from 2006 to 2007 for\nBarclays Global Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBGFA \u201d ). Ms. Hsui has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund\nsince 2022. Greg Savage has been\nemployed by BFA or its affiliates\nas a senior portfolio manager\nsince 2006. Prior to that, Mr.\nSavage was a portfolio manager\nfrom 2001 to 2006 for BGFA. Mr.\nSavage has been a Portfolio\nManager of the Fund since 2022.\nPaul Whitehead has been with\nBlackRock since 1996, including\nhis years with Barclays Global\nInvestors ( \u201c BGI \u201d ), which\nmerged with BlackRock in 2009.\nMr. Whitehead has been employed\nby BlackRock as a Managing\nDirector since 2010 and a\nDirector from 2009 to 2010. Mr.\nWhitehead was employed by BGI as\nPrincipal from 2002 to 2009. Mr.\nWhitehead has been a Portfolio\nManager of the Fund since 2022.\nThe Fund's SAI provides\nadditional information about the\nPortfolio Managers' compensation,\nother accounts managed by the\nPortfolio Managers and the\nPortfolio Managers' ownership (if\nany) of shares in the Fund.\nAdministrator, Custodian and\nTransfer Agent. JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d ) is\nthe administrator, custodian and\ntransfer agent for the Fund.\nConflicts of Interest. The\ninvestment activities of BFA and\nits affiliates (including\nBlackRock and its subsidiaries\n(collectively, the \u201c Affiliates \u201d\n)), and their respective\ndirectors, officers or employees,\nin the management of, or their\ninterest in, their own accounts\nand other accounts they manage,\nmay present conflicts of interest\nthat could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. BFA and its\nAffiliates provide investment 42\nmanagement services to other\nfunds and discretionary managed\naccounts that may follow\ninvestment programs similar to\nthat of the Fund. BFA and its\nAffiliates are involved worldwide\nwith a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset\nmanagement activities and may\nengage in the ordinary course of\nbusiness in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests\nof their clients may conflict\nwith those of the Fund. BFA or\none or more Affiliates act, or\nmay act, as an investor, research\nprovider, investment manager,\ncommodity pool operator,\ncommodity trading advisor,\nfinancier, underwriter, adviser,\ntrader, lender, index provider,\nagent and/or principal, and have\nother direct and indirect\ninterests in securities,\ncurrencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other instruments\nin which the Fund may directly or\nindirectly invest. The Fund may\ninvest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions\nwith, companies with which an\nAffiliate has significant debt or\nequity investments or other\ninterests. The Fund may also\ninvest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for\nwhich an Affiliate provides and\nis compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to\nthe proceeds from the sale of\nsuch issuances. The Fund also may\ninvest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions\nwith, companies for which an\nAffiliate provides or may in the\nfuture provide research coverage.\nAn Affiliate may have business\nrelationships with, and purchase\nor distribute or sell services or\nproducts from or to,\ndistributors, consultants or\nothers who recommend the Fund or\nwho engage in transactions with\nor for the Fund, and may receive\ncompensation for such services.\nBFA or one or more Affiliates may\nengage in proprietary trading and\nadvise accounts and funds that\nhave investment objectives\nsimilar to those of the Fund\nand/or that engage in and compete\nfor transactions in the same\ntypes of securities, currencies\nand other instruments as the\nFund. This may include\ntransactions in securities issued\nby other open-end and closed-end\ninvestment companies (which may\ninclude investment companies that\nare affiliated with the Fund and\nBFA, to the extent permitted\nunder the Investment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended (the \u201c 1940\nAct \u201d )). The trading activities\nof BFA and these Affiliates are\ncarried out without reference to\npositions held directly or\nindirectly by the Fund and may\nresult in BFA or an Affiliate\nhaving positions in certain\nsecurities that are senior or\njunior to, or have interests\ndifferent from or adverse to, the\nsecurities that are owned by the\nFund. Neither BlackRock nor any\nAffiliate is under any obligation\nto share any investment\nopportunity, idea or strategy\nwith the Fund. As a result, an\nAffiliate may compete with the\nFund for appropriate investment\nopportunities. The results of the\nFund's investment activities,\ntherefore, may differ from those\nof an Affiliate and of other\naccounts managed by BlackRock or\nan Affiliate, and it is possible\nthat the Fund could sustain\nlosses during periods in which\none or more Affiliates and other\naccounts achieve profits on their\ntrading for proprietary or other\naccounts. The opposite result is\nalso possible. In addition, the\nFund may, from time to time,\nenter into transactions in which\nBFA or an Affiliate or its or\ntheir directors, officers,\nemployees or clients have an\nadverse interest. Furthermore,\ntransactions undertaken by\nclients advised or managed by BFA\nor its Affiliates may adversely\nimpact the Fund. Transactions by\none or more clients or by BFA or\nits Affiliates or their\ndirectors, officers or employees\nmay have the effect of diluting\nor otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment\nstrategies of the Fund. 43 The\nFund's activities may be limited\nbecause of regulatory\nrestrictions applicable to BFA or\none or more Affiliates and/or\ntheir internal policies designed\nto comply with such restrictions.\nUnder a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board,\nthe Fund has retained BTC, an\nAffiliate of BFA, to serve as the\nsecurities lending agent for the\nFund to the extent that the Fund\nparticipates in the securities\nlending program. For these\nservices, the securities lending\nagent will receive a fee from the\nFund based on the returns earned\non the Fund\u2019s lending activities,\nincluding investment of the cash\nreceived as collateral for the\nloaned securities. In addition,\none or more Affiliates may be\namong the entities to which the\nFund may lend its portfolio\nsecurities under the securities\nlending program. Under an ETF\nServices Agreement, the Fund has\nretained BlackRock Investments,\nLLC (the \u201c Distributor \u201d or \u201c\nBRIL \u201d ), an Affiliate of BFA, to\nperform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant\ncommunications, and related\nservices in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of\nCreation Units of the Fund ( \u201c\nETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will\nretain a portion of the standard\ntransaction fee received from\nAuthorized Participants on each\ncreation or redemption order from\nthe Authorized Participant for\nthe ETF Services provided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and\nreceived payment from, Citibank,\nN.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d ) on the\ndesign and development of the ETF\nServices platform. Citibank may\nhave, or from time to time may\ndevelop, additional relationships\nwith BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its affiliates. It is\nalso possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its\nadvisory clients (including other\nfunds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law,\npurchase and hold shares of the\nFund. The price, availability,\nliquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of the Fund may be\nimpacted by purchases and sales\nof the Fund by BlackRock and/or\nits advisory clients. The\nactivities of BFA and its\nAffiliates and their respective\ndirectors, officers or employees\nmay give rise to other conflicts\nof interest that could\ndisadvantage the Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted\npolicies and procedures designed\nto address these potential\nconflicts of interest. See the\nSAI for further information.\nShareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy\nand sell shares of the Fund, is\navailable free of charge by\ncalling toll-free: 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting our\nwebsite at www.iShares.com.\nBuying and Selling Shares. Shares\nof the Fund may be acquired or\nredeemed directly from the Fund\nonly in Creation Units or\nmultiples thereof, as discussed\nin the Creations and Redemptions\nsection of this Prospectus. Only\nan Authorized Participant may\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. Once created, shares of the\nFund generally trade in the\nsecondary market in amounts less\nthan a Creation Unit. Shares of\nthe Fund are listed on a national\nsecurities exchange for trading\nduring the trading day. Shares\ncan be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day like shares of\nother publicly traded companies.\nThe Trust does not impose any\nminimum investment 44 for shares\nof the Fund purchased on an\nexchange or otherwise in the\nsecondary market. The Fund's\nshares trade under the ticker\nsymbol \u201c BYLD. \u201d Buying or\nselling Fund shares on an\nexchange or other secondary\nmarket involves two types of\ncosts that may apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling shares of the\nFund through a broker, you may\nincur a brokerage commission and\nother charges. The commission is\nfrequently a fixed amount and may\nbe a significant proportional\ncost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell small amounts of shares.\nIn addition, you may incur the\ncost of the \u201c spread, \u201d that is,\nany difference between the bid\nprice and the ask price. The\nspread varies over time for\nshares of the Fund based on the\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market\nliquidity, and is generally lower\nif the Fund has high trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and\nhigher if the Fund has little\ntrading volume and market\nliquidity (which is often the\ncase for funds that are newly\nlaunched or small in size). The\nFund's spread may also be\nimpacted by the liquidity or\nilliquidity of the underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund,\nparticularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds or in instances\nof significant volatility of the\nunderlying securities. The Fund\ndoes not impose restrictions on\nthe frequency of purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with the Fund. The Board\ndetermined not to adopt policies\nand procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent\npurchases and redemptions of Fund\nshares because the Fund generally\nsells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions\nthat are in-kind and/or for cash,\nwith a deadline for placing cash-\nrelated transactions no later\nthan the close of the primary\nmarkets for the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities. However, the Fund has\ntaken certain measures ( e.g .,\nimposing transaction fees on\npurchases and redemptions of\nCreation Units and reserving the\nright to reject purchases of\nCreation Units under certain\ncircumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of\nfrequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased\ntracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution to\nthe Fund, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the\nvast majority of trading in Fund\nshares occurs on the secondary\nmarket, which does not involve\nthe Fund directly, and such\ntrading is unlikely to cause many\nof the harmful effects of\nfrequent cash purchases or\nredemptions of Fund shares. The\nnational securities exchange on\nwhich the Fund's shares are\nlisted is open for trading Monday\nthrough Friday and is closed on\nweekends and the following\nholidays (or the days on which\nthey are observed): New Year\u2019s\nDay, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents\u2019 Day, Good Friday,\nMemorial Day, Juneteenth,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. The Fund\u2019s primary listing\nexchange is NYSE Arca. Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments\nby investment companies,\nincluding foreign and\nunregistered investment\ncompanies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For\nexample, a registered investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Fund, may not\nknowingly sell or otherwise\ndispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any\ninvestment company (the \u201c\nAcquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company\nor companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately\nafter such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the\nAcquired Fund is owned by the\nAcquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund or (ii) more than\n10% of the total outstanding\nvoting 45 stock of the Acquired\nFund is owned by the Acquiring\nFund and other investment\ncompanies and companies\ncontrolled by them. Although SEC\nrules may permit registered\ninvestment companies and unit\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c Investing\nFunds \u201d ) that enter into an\ninvestment agreement with the\nTrust to invest in iShares funds\nbeyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\nsubject to certain terms and\nconditions, the Fund does not\npermit such investments.\nAccordingly, Investing Funds must\nadhere to the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\nwhen investing in the Fund. In\naddition, foreign investment\ncompanies are permitted to invest\nin the Fund only up to the limits\nset forth in Section 12(d)(1),\nsubject to any applicable SEC no-\naction relief. Book Entry. Shares\nof the Fund are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no\nstock certificates are issued.\nThe Depository Trust Company ( \u201c\nDTC \u201d ) or its nominee is the\nrecord owner of, and holds legal\ntitle to, all outstanding shares\nof the Fund. Investors owning\nshares of the Fund are beneficial\nowners as shown on the records of\nDTC or its participants. DTC\nserves as the securities\ndepository for shares of the\nFund. DTC participants include\nsecurities brokers and dealers,\nbanks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and other\ninstitutions that directly or\nindirectly maintain a custodial\nrelationship with DTC. As a\nbeneficial owner of shares, you\nare not entitled to receive\nphysical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares\nregistered in your name, and you\nare not considered a registered\nowner of shares. Therefore, to\nexercise any right as an owner of\nshares, you must rely upon the\nprocedures of DTC and its\nparticipants. These procedures\nare the same as those that apply\nto any other securities that you\nhold in book-entry or \u201c street\nname \u201d form. Share Prices. The\ntrading prices of the Fund\u2019s\nshares in the secondary market\ngenerally differ from the Fund\u2019s\ndaily NAV and are affected by\nmarket forces such as the supply\nof and demand for ETF shares and\nunderlying securities held by the\nFund, economic conditions and\nother factors. Determination of\nNet Asset Value. The NAV of the\nFund normally is determined once\ndaily Monday through Friday,\ngenerally as of the close of\nregular trading hours of the New\nYork Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d )\n(normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern\ntime) on each day that the NYSE\nis open for trading, based on\nprices at the time of closing,\nprovided that any Fund assets or\nliabilities denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S.\ndollar are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market\nrates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data\nservice providers. The NAV of the\nFund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the net assets of\nthe Fund ( i.e. , the value of\nits total assets, which includes\nthe values of the Underlying Fund\nshares in which the Fund invests,\nless total liabilities) by the\ntotal number of outstanding\nshares of the Fund, generally\nrounded to the nearest cent. The\nvalue of the securities and other\nassets and liabilities held by\nthe Fund is determined pursuant\nto BFA\u2019s valuation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the\nvaluation designee for the Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the\n1940 Act. Equity securities and\nother equity instruments for\nwhich market quotations are\nreadily available are valued at\nmarket value, which is generally\ndetermined using the last 46\nreported official closing price\nor, if a reported closing price\nis not available, the last traded\nprice on the exchange or market\non which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at\nthe time of valuation. Shares of\nunderlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds)\nare valued at net asset value.\nShares of underlying exchange-\ntraded closed-end funds or other\nETFs are valued at their most\nrecent closing price. The Fund\nvalues fixed-income portfolio\nsecurities using last available\nbid prices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or\nprices (including evaluated\nprices) supplied by the Fund's\napproved independent third-party\npricing services, each in\naccordance with BFA's valuation\npolicies and procedures. Pricing\nservices may use matrix pricing\nor valuation models that utilize\ncertain inputs and assumptions to\nderive values. Pricing services\ngenerally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly\ntransactions of an institutional\nround lot size, but the Fund may\nhold or transact in such\nsecurities in smaller odd lot\nsizes. Odd lots often trade at\nlower prices than institutional\nround lots. An amortized cost\nmethod of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations\nwith sixty days or less remaining\nto maturity unless BFA determines\nin good faith that such method\ndoes not represent fair value.\nGenerally, trading in non-U.S.\nsecurities and money market\ninstruments is substantially\ncompleted each day at various\ntimes prior to the close of\nregular trading hours of the\nNYSE. The values of such\nsecurities used in computing the\nNAV of the Fund are determined as\nof such times. When market\nquotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA\nto be unreliable, BFA will fair\nvalue the Fund\u2019s investments in\naccordance with its policies and\nprocedures. BFA may conclude that\na market quotation is not readily\navailable or is unreliable if a\nsecurity or other asset or\nliability does not have a price\nsource due to its lack of trading\nor other reasons, if a market\nquotation differs significantly\nfrom recent price quotations or\notherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value, where the\nsecurity or other asset or\nliability is thinly traded, when\nthere is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent\nmarket quotation, or if the\ntrading market on which a\nsecurity is listed is suspended\nor closed and no appropriate\nalternative trading market is\navailable. A \u201c significant event\n\u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable\nbusiness judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, that the\nevent is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last\nexchange closing price or closing\nmarket price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities\nof, the Fund. Fair value\nrepresents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair\nvalue of an asset or liability\nheld by the Fund is the amount\nthe Fund might reasonably expect\nto receive from the current sale\nof that asset or the cost to\nextinguish that liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. Valuing\nthe Fund\u2019s investments using fair\nvalue pricing will result in\nprices that may differ from\ncurrent market valuations and\nthat may not be the prices at\nwhich those investments could\nhave been sold during the period\nin which the particular fair\nvalues were used. Use of fair\nvalue prices and certain current\nmarket valuations could result in\na difference between the prices\nused to calculate the Fund\u2019s NAV\nand the prices used by the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn,\ncould result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. 47 Dividends\nand Distributions. General\nPolicies. Dividends from net\ninvestment income, if any,\ngenerally are declared and paid\nat least once a year by the Fund.\nThe Fund generally distributes\nits net capital gains, if any, to\nshareholders annually.\nDistributions of net realized\nsecurities gains, if any,\ngenerally are declared and paid\nonce a year, but the Trust may\nmake distributions on a more\nfrequent basis for the Fund. The\nTrust reserves the right to\ndeclare special distributions if,\nin its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or\nadvisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company\nor to avoid imposition of income\nor excise taxes on undistributed\nincome or realized gains.\nDividends and other distributions\non shares of the Fund are\ndistributed on a pro rata basis\nto beneficial owners of such\nshares. Dividend payments are\nmade through DTC participants and\nindirect participants to\nbeneficial owners then of record\nwith proceeds received from the\nFund. Dividend Reinvestment\nService. No dividend reinvestment\nservice is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make available\nthe DTC book-entry Dividend\nReinvestment Service for use by\nbeneficial owners of the Fund for\nreinvestment of their dividend\ndistributions. Beneficial owners\nshould contact their broker to\ndetermine the availability and\ncosts of the service and the\ndetails of participation therein.\nBrokers may require beneficial\nowners to adhere to specific\nprocedures and timetables. If\nthis service is available and\nused, dividend distributions of\nboth income and realized gains\nwill be automatically reinvested\nin additional whole shares of the\nFund purchased in the secondary\nmarket. Note on Tax Information.\nThe following sections summarize\nsome of the consequences under\ncurrent U.S. federal tax law of\nan investment in the Fund. It is\nnot a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. You may also be subject\nto state and local taxation on\nFund distributions and sales of\nshares. Certain states and\nlocalities may exempt from tax\ndistributions attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal\ngovernment obligations. Consult\nyour personal tax advisor about\nthe potential tax consequences of\nan investment in shares of the\nFund under all applicable tax\nlaws. Taxes. As with any\ninvestment, you should consider\nhow your investment in shares of\nthe Fund will be taxed. The tax\ninformation in this Prospectus is\nprovided as general information,\nbased on current law. You should\nconsult your own tax professional\nabout the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of the Fund.\nUnless your investment in Fund\nshares is made through a tax-\nexempt entity or tax-deferred\nretirement account, such as an\nIRA, you need to be aware of the\npossible tax consequences when\nthe Fund makes distributions or\nyou sell Fund shares. Taxes on\nDistributions. Distributions from\nthe Fund\u2019s net investment income,\nincluding distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and\ndistributions out of the Fund\u2019s\nnet short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as\nordinary income. Distributions by\nthe Fund of net long-term capital\ngains, if any, in excess of net\nshort-term capital losses\n(capital gain dividends) are\ntaxable to you as long-term\ncapital gains, regardless of how\nlong you have held the Fund\u2019s\nshares. Long-term capital gains\nand qualified dividend income are\ngenerally eligible for taxation\nat a maximum rate of 15% or 20%\nfor non-corporate shareholders,\ndepending on whether their income\n48 exceeds certain threshold\namounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S.\nfederal Medicare contribution tax\nis imposed on \u201c net investment\nincome, \u201d including, but not\nlimited to, interest, dividends,\nand net gain, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000\n(or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates\nand trusts. You may lose the\nability to use foreign tax\ncredits passed through by the\nFund if your Fund shares are\nloaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending agreement. In\ngeneral, your distributions are\nsubject to U.S. federal income\ntax for the year when they are\npaid. Certain distributions paid\nin January, however, may be\ntreated as paid on December 31 of\nthe prior year. Because the Fund\ninvests in Underlying Funds, the\nFund\u2019s realized losses on sales\nof shares of an Underlying Fund\nmay be indefinitely or\npermanently deferred as \u201c wash\nsales. \u201d Distributions of short-\nterm capital gains by an\nUnderlying Fund will be\nrecognized as ordinary income by\nthe Fund and would not be offset\nby the Fund\u2019s capital loss\ncarryforwards, if any. Capital\nloss carryforwards of an\nUnderlying Fund, if any, would\nnot offset net capital gains of\nthe Fund. If the Fund\u2019s\ndistributions exceed current and\naccumulated earnings and profits,\nall or a portion of the\ndistributions made in the taxable\nyear may be recharacterized as a\nreturn of capital to\nshareholders. Distributions in\nexcess of the Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but\nnot in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will\nnot constitute nontaxable returns\nof capital. A return of capital\ndistribution generally will not\nbe taxable but will reduce the\nshareholder\u2019s cost basis and\nresult in a higher capital gain\nor lower capital loss when those\nshares on which the distribution\nwas received are sold. Once a\nshareholder's cost basis is\nreduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as\ncapital gain, if the shareholder\nholds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets. Dividends,\ninterest and capital gains earned\nby an Underlying Fund with\nrespect to securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers may give rise to\nwithholding and other taxes\nimposed by non-U.S. countries.\nTax conventions between certain\ncountries and the U.S. may reduce\nor eliminate such taxes. If more\nthan 50% of the total assets of\nan Underlying Fund at the close\nof a year consists of non-U.S.\nstocks or securities (generally,\nfor this purpose, depositary\nreceipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated\nas \u201c non-U.S. \u201d ) (and 50% of the\ntotal assets of the Fund at the\nclose of the year consists of\nsecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers, or, at the close of each\nquarter, shares of an Underlying\nFund), the Fund may \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to you certain non-U.S.\nincome taxes (including\nwithholding taxes) paid by the\nFund or an Underlying Fund. This\nmeans that you would be\nconsidered to have received as an\nadditional dividend your share of\nsuch non-U.S. taxes, but you may\nbe entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in\ncalculating your taxable income,\nor, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in\ncalculating your U.S. federal\nincome tax. For purposes of\nforeign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of the Fund, foreign\ncapital gains taxes may not\nproduce associated foreign source\nincome, limiting the availability\nof such credits for U.S. persons.\nIf you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you\nare a non-U.S. entity (other than\na pass-through entity to the\nextent owned by U.S. persons),\nthe Fund\u2019s 49 ordinary income\ndividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term\ncapital gains) will generally be\nsubject to a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax, unless a lower treaty rate\napplies, provided that\nwithholding tax will generally\nnot apply to any gain or income\nrealized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder in respect of any\ndistributions of long-term\ncapital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of shares of\nthe Fund. Separately, a 30%\nwithholding tax is currently\nimposed on U.S.-source dividends,\ninterest and other income items\npaid to (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S.\ninvestment funds, unless they\nagree to collect and disclose to\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Service\n( \u201c IRS \u201d ) information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S.\naccount holders and (ii) certain\nother foreign entities, unless\nthey certify certain information\nregarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid\nwithholding, foreign financial\ninstitutions will need to (i)\nenter into agreements with the\nIRS that state that they will\nprovide the IRS information,\nincluding the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification\nnumbers of direct and indirect\nU.S. account holders, comply with\ndue diligence procedures with\nrespect to the identification of\nU.S. accounts, report to the IRS\ncertain information with respect\nto U.S. accounts maintained,\nagree to withhold tax on certain\npayments made to non-compliant\nforeign financial institutions or\nto account holders who fail to\nprovide the required information,\nand determine certain other\ninformation concerning their\naccount holders, or (ii) in the\nevent that an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are\nadopted, provide local revenue\nauthorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign\nentities will need to provide the\nname, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each\nsubstantial U.S. owner or\ncertifications of no substantial\nU.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. As the Fund\ninvests in only a limited number\nof positions, the Fund may be\nrequired to defer for tax\npurposes significant amounts of\nrealized losses on the sale of\nshares in Underlying Funds\nindefinitely. If you are a\nresident or a citizen of the\nU.S., by law, backup withholding\nat a 24% rate will apply to your\ndistributions and proceeds if you\nhave not provided a taxpayer\nidentification number or social\nsecurity number and made other\nrequired certifications. Taxes\nWhen Shares Are Sold. Currently,\nany capital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund shares is\ngenerally treated as a long-term\ngain or loss if the shares have\nbeen held for more than one year.\nAny capital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund shares held\nfor one year or less is generally\ntreated as short-term gain or\nloss, except that any capital\nloss on the sale of shares held\nfor six months or less is treated\nas long-term capital loss to the\nextent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect\nto such shares. Any such capital\ngains, including from sales of\nFund shares or from capital gain\ndividends, are included in \u201c net\ninvestment income \u201d for purposes\nof the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions. Prior\nto trading in the secondary\nmarket, shares of the Fund are \u201c\ncreated \u201d at NAV by market\nmakers, large investors and\ninstitutions only in block-size\nCreation Units or multiples\nthereof. Each \u201c creator \u201d or\nauthorized participant (an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d ) has\nentered into an agreement with\nthe Fund's Distributor, an\naffiliate of BFA. An Authorized\nParticipant is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency\nregistered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the\n50 Fund or one of its service\nproviders that allows such member\nor participant to place orders\nfor the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. A creation\ntransaction, which is subject to\nacceptance by the Distributor and\nthe Fund, generally takes place\nwhen an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into the Fund a\ndesignated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other\npositions (a \u201c creation basket \u201d\n), and an amount of cash\n(including any cash representing\nthe value of substituted\nsecurities, assets or other\npositions), if any, which\ntogether approximate the holdings\nof the Fund in exchange for a\nspecified number of Creation\nUnits. Similarly, shares can be\nredeemed only in Creation Units,\ngenerally for a designated\nportfolio of securities, assets\nor other positions (a \u201c\nredemption basket \u201d ) held by the\nFund and an amount of cash\n(including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be\nsubstituted). The Fund may, in\ncertain circumstances, offer\nCreation Units partially or\nsolely for cash. Except when\naggregated in Creation Units,\nshares are not redeemable by the\nFund. Creation and redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Fund\nwill accept \u201c custom baskets. \u201d\nMore information regarding custom\nbaskets is contained in the\nFund's SAI. The prices at which\ncreations and redemptions occur\nare based on the next calculation\nof NAV after a creation or\nredemption order is received in\nan acceptable form under the\nauthorized participant agreement.\nOnly an Authorized Participant\nmay create or redeem Creation\nUnits with the Fund. Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem\nCreation Units for their own\naccounts or for customers,\nincluding, without limitation,\naffiliates of the Fund. In the\nevent of a system failure or\nother interruption, including\ndisruptions at market makers or\nAuthorized Participants, orders\nto purchase or redeem Creation\nUnits either may not be executed\naccording to the Fund's\ninstructions or may not be\nexecuted at all, or the Fund may\nnot be able to place or change\norders. To the extent the Fund\nengages in in-kind transactions,\nthe Fund intends to comply with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws\nin accepting securities for\ndeposit and satisfying\nredemptions with redemption\nsecurities by, among other means,\nassuring that any securities\naccepted for deposit and any\nsecurities used to satisfy\nredemption requests will be sold\nin transactions that would be\nexempt from registration under\nthe 1933 Act. Further, an\nAuthorized Participant that is\nnot a \u201c qualified institutional\nbuyer, \u201d as such term is defined\nin Rule 144A under the 1933 Act,\nwill not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible\nfor resale under Rule 144A.\nCreations and redemptions must be\nmade through a firm that is\neither a member of the Continuous\nNet Settlement System of the\nNational Securities Clearing\nCorporation or a DTC participant\nthat has executed an agreement\nwith the Distributor with respect\nto creations and redemptions of\nCreation Unit aggregations.\nInformation about the procedures\nregarding creation and redemption\nof Creation Units (including the\ncut-off times for receipt of\ncreation and redemption orders)\nis included in the Fund's SAI.\nBecause new shares may be created\nand issued on an ongoing basis,\nat any point during the life of\nthe Fund a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933\nAct, may be occurring. Broker-\ndealers and other persons are\ncautioned that some activities on\ntheir part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their\nbeing deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that\ncould render them statutory\nunderwriters 51 subject to the\nprospectus delivery and liability\nprovisions of the 1933 Act. Any\ndetermination of whether one is\nan underwriter must take into\naccount all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each\nparticular case. Broker-dealers\nshould also note that dealers who\nare not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution\n(as contrasted to ordinary\nsecondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part\nof an \u201c unsold allotment \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C)\nof the 1933 Act, would be unable\nto take advantage of the\nprospectus delivery exemption\nprovided by Section 4(a)(3) of\nthe 1933 Act. For delivery of\nprospectuses to exchange members,\nthe prospectus delivery mechanism\nof Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is\navailable only with respect to\ntransactions on a national\nsecurities exchange.\nHouseholding. Householding is an\noption available to certain Fund\ninvestors. Householding is a\nmethod of delivery, based on the\npreference of the individual\ninvestor, in which a single copy\nof certain shareholder documents\ncan be delivered to investors who\nshare the same address, even if\ntheir accounts are registered\nunder different names. Please\ncontact your broker-dealer if you\nare interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a\nsingle copy of prospectuses and\nother shareholder documents, or\nif you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change\nyour householding status. 52\nDistribution The Distributor or\nits agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the Fund on an agency\nbasis. The Distributor does not\nmaintain a secondary market in\nshares of the Fund. The\nDistributor has no role in\ndetermining the policies of the\nFund or the securities that are\npurchased or sold by the Fund.\nThe Distributor\u2019s principal\naddress is 50 Hudson Yards, New\nYork, NY 10001. BFA or its\naffiliates make payments to\nbroker-dealers, registered\ninvestment advisers, banks or\nother intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to\nmarketing activities and\npresentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems,\ndata provision services, or their\nmaking shares of the Fund and\ncertain other iShares funds\navailable to their customers\ngenerally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such\npayments, which may be\nsignificant to the intermediary,\nare not made by the Fund. Rather,\nsuch payments are made by BFA or\nits affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or\nindirectly in part from fees paid\nby the iShares funds complex.\nPayments of this type are\nsometimes referred to as revenue-\nsharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it\nrecommends or makes available, or\nthe level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the\npayments or other financial\nincentives it is eligible to\nreceive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives\noffered or made to an\nintermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary\nand its customers and may cause\nthe intermediary to recommend the\nFund or other iShares funds over\nanother investment. More\ninformation regarding these\npayments is contained in the\nFund's and each Underlying Fund's\nSAI.

The Trust was\norganized as a Delaware statutory trust on\nDecember 16, 1999 and is authorized to have\nmultiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 Act.\nThe offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ). This SAI\nrelates solely to the Fund. The Fund is\nmanaged by BFA, an indirect wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally\nseeks to track the investment results of the\nspecific benchmark index identified in the\nFund's Prospectus (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ).\nThe Fund offers and issues shares at their net\nasset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares,\nassets or other positions (each, a \u201c Creation\nUnit \u201d ), generally in exchange for a\ndesignated portfolio of securities (including\nany portion of such securities for which cash\nmay be substituted) included in its Underlying\nIndex (the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d or \u201c\nCreation Basket \u201d ), together with the deposit\nof a specified cash payment (the \u201c Cash\nComponent \u201d ). Shares of the Fund are listed\nfor trading on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. ( \u201c\nCboe BZX \u201d or the \u201c Listing Exchange \u201d ), a\nnational securities exchange. Shares of the\nFund are traded in the secondary market and\nelsewhere at market prices that may be at,\nabove or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are\nredeemable only in Creation Units, and,\ngenerally, in exchange for portfolio\nsecurities and a Cash Amount (as defined in\nthe Creation and Redemption of Creation Units-\nRole of the Authorized Participant section of\nthis SAI). Creation Units typically are a\nspecified number of shares, generally 50,000\nor multiples thereof. The Trust reserves the\nright to permit or require that creations and\nredemptions of shares are effected fully or\npartially in cash and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of cash. Shares may be\nissued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities, subject to various conditions,\nincluding a requirement that the Authorized\nParticipant maintain with the Trust collateral\nas set forth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to purchase Deposit\nSecurities. See the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI.\nTransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith creations or redemptions that include a\ncash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin the Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of the Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe Prospectus. Shares of the Fund are listed\nfor trading, and trade throughout the day, on\nthe Listing Exchange and in other secondary\nmarkets. Shares of the Fund may also be listed\non certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no\nassurance that the requirements of the Listing\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nshares of the Fund will continue to be met.\nThe Listing Exchange may, but is not required\nto, remove the shares of the Fund from listing\nif, among other things: (i) the Fund is no\nlonger eligible to operate in reliance on Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act; (ii)\nany of the other listing requirements are not\ncontinuously maintained; or (iii) any event\nshall occur or condition shall exist that, in\nthe opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes\nfurther dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of the Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission determined by that broker, as well\nas other charges. The Trust reserves the right\nto adjust the share price of the Fund in the\nfuture to maintain convenient trading ranges\nfor investors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund.\n\n1\n\nInvestment Strategies and Risks The Fund seeks\nto achieve its objective by investing\nprimarily in the securities of the Underlying\nFunds that themselves seek investment results\ncorresponding to their own underlying indexes.\nThe Fund operates as an index fund and is not\nactively managed. Adverse performance of a\nsecurity in the Fund\u2019s portfolio will\nordinarily not result in the elimination of\nthe security from the Fund\u2019s portfolio. The\nFund engages in representative sampling, which\nis investing in a sample of securities\nselected by BFA to have a collective\ninvestment profile similar to that of the\nFund's Underlying Index. Securities selected\nhave aggregate investment characteristics\n(based on market capitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental characteristics (such\nas return variability, earnings valuation and\nyield) and liquidity measures similar to those\nof the Fund\u2019s Underlying Index. A fund that\nuses representative sampling generally does\nnot hold all of the securities that are in its\nunderlying index. Although the Fund does not\nseek leveraged returns, certain instruments\nused by the Fund may have a leveraging effect\nas described below. The Fund generally will\ninvest at least 80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities (including indirect\ninvestments through the Underlying Funds) of\nthe Underlying Index and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures, options and\nswap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding shares of money market funds advised\nby BFA or its affiliates, as well as in\nsecurities not included in the Underlying\nIndex, but which BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index. Set forth\nbelow is more detailed information regarding\ntypes of instruments in which the Underlying\nFunds, and in some cases, the Fund, may\ninvest, strategies BFA may employ in pursuit\nof the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestment objective, and related risks.\nAsset-Backed and Commercial Mortgage-Backed\nSecurities. Certain of the Underlying Funds\nmay invest in asset-backed securities ( \u201c ABS\n\u201d ) and commercial mortgage-backed securities\n( \u201c CMBS \u201d ). ABS are securities backed by\ninstallment contracts, credit-card receivables\nor other assets. CMBS are securities backed by\ncommercial real estate properties. Both ABS\nand CMBS represent interests in \u201c pools \u201d of\nassets in which payments of both interest and\nprincipal on the securities are made on a\nregular basis. The payments are, in effect, \u201c\npassed through \u201d to the holder of the\nsecurities (net of any fees paid to the issuer\nor guarantor of the securities). The average\nlife of ABS and CMBS varies with the\nmaturities of the underlying instruments and,\nas a result of prepayments, can often be less\nthan the original maturity of the assets\nunderlying the securities. For this and other\nreasons, the stated maturity of an ABS or CMBS\nmay be shortened, and the security\u2019s total\nreturn may be difficult to predict precisely.\nAlso see Mortgage Pass-Through Securities and\nMortgage Securities below. Beginning in the\nsecond half of 2007 through 2009, the market\nfor ABS and mortgage-backed securities ( \u201c MBS\n\u201d ) experienced substantially, often\ndramatically, lower valuations and reduced\nliquidity. These instruments continue to be\nsubject to liquidity constraints, price\nvolatility, credit downgrades and increases in\ndefault rates and, therefore, may be more\ndifficult to value and more difficult to\ndispose of than previously. Bonds. Certain of\nthe Underlying Funds may invest in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. A bond is\nan interest-bearing security issued by a U.S.\nor non-U.S. company or governmental unit. The\nissuer of a bond has a contractual obligation\nto pay interest at a stated rate on specific\ndates and to repay principal (the bond\u2019s face\nvalue) periodically or on a specified maturity\ndate. Bonds generally are used by issuers to\nborrow money from investors. An issuer may\nhave the right to redeem or \u201c call \u201d a bond\nbefore maturity, in which case an Underlying\nFund may have to reinvest the proceeds at\nlower market rates. Similarly, an Underlying\nFund may have to reinvest interest income or\npayments received when bonds mature, sometimes\nat lower market rates. Most bonds bear\ninterest income at a \u201c coupon \u201d rate that is\nfixed for the life of the bond. The value of a\nfixed-rate bond usually rises when market\ninterest rates fall, and falls when market\ninterest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed-rate\nbond\u2019s yield (income as a percent of the\nbond\u2019s current value) may differ from its\ncoupon rate as its value rises or falls. When\nan investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a\nprice that is greater than its face value, the\ninvestor is purchasing the bond at a premium.\nConversely, when an investor purchases a\nfixed-rate bond at a price that is less than\nits face value, the investor is purchasing the\nbond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are\npurchased at a discount pay less current\nincome than securities with comparable yields\nthat are purchased at face value, with the\nresult that prices for such fixed-rate\nsecurities can be more volatile than prices\nfor such securities that are purchased at face\nvalue. Other types of bonds bear interest at\nan interest rate that is adjusted\nperiodically. Interest rates on \u201c floating\nrate \u201d or \u201c variable\n\n2\n\nrate \u201d bonds may be higher or lower than\ncurrent market rates for fixed-rate bonds of\ncomparable quality with similar final\nmaturities. Because of their adjustable\ninterest rates, the value of \u201c floating rate \u201d\nor \u201c variable rate \u201d bonds fluctuates much\nless in response to market interest rate\nmovements than the value of fixed-rate bonds,\nbut their value may decline if their interest\nrates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as\ninterest rates in general. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may treat some of these bonds\nas having a shorter maturity for purposes of\ncalculating the weighted average maturity of\nits investment portfolio. Generally, prices of\nhigher quality issues tend to fluctuate less\nwith changes in market interest rates than\nprices of lower quality issues and prices of\nlonger maturity issues tend to fluctuate more\nthan prices of shorter maturity issues. Bonds\nmay be senior or subordinated obligations.\nSenior obligations generally have the first\nclaim on an issuer\u2019s earnings and assets and,\nin the event of liquidation, are paid before\nsubordinated obligations. Bonds may be\nunsecured (backed only by the issuer\u2019s general\ncreditworthiness) or secured (backed by\nspecified collateral). Borrowing. The Fund may\nborrow for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The purchase\nof securities while borrowings are outstanding\nmay have the effect of leveraging the Fund.\nThe incurrence of leverage increases the\nFund\u2019s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds\nare subject to interest costs that will reduce\nnet income. Purchasing securities while\nborrowings are outstanding creates special\nrisks, such as the potential for greater\nvolatility in the NAV of Fund shares and in\nthe yield on the Fund\u2019s portfolio. In\naddition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the\namount available (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\nthe Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by the Fund must be made from a\nbank or may result in the Fund being subject\nto covenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire the Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Corporate Bonds.\nCertain of the Underlying Funds may invest in\ninvestment grade and/or high yield corporate\nbonds. High yield corporate bonds may be\ndeemed speculative and more volatile than\nhigher rated securities of similar maturity.\nThe investment return of corporate bonds\nreflects interest earned on the security and\nchanges in the market value of the security.\nThe market value of a corporate bond may be\naffected by changes in the market rate of\ninterest, the credit rating of the issuer, the\nissuer\u2019s performance and perceptions of the\nissuer in the marketplace. There is a risk\nthat the issuers of the securities may not be\nable to meet their obligations on interest or\nprincipal payments at the time called for by\nan instrument. Currency Transactions. A\ncurrency forward contract is an over-the-\ncounter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) obligation to purchase or\nsell a specific currency at a future date,\nwhich may be any fixed number of days greater\nthan two days from the date on which the\ncontract is agreed upon by the parties, at a\nprice set at the time of the contract. A non-\ndeliverable currency forward is an OTC\ncurrency forward settled in a specified\ncurrency, on a specified date, based on the\ndifference between the agreed-upon exchange\nrate and the market exchange rate. A currency\nfutures contract is a contract that trades on\nan organized futures exchange involving an\nobligation to deliver or acquire a specified\namount of a specific currency, at a specified\nprice and at a specified future time. Currency\nfutures contracts may be settled on a net cash\npayment basis rather than by the sale and\ndelivery of the underlying currency. The Fund\nor Underlying Funds do not expect to engage in\ncurrency transactions for the purpose of\nhedging against declines in the value of the\nUnderlying Funds' assets that are denominated\nin a non-U.S. currency. The Underlying Fund\nmay enter into non-U.S. currency forward and\nnon-U.S. currency futures transactions to\nfacilitate local securities settlements or to\nprotect against currency exposure in\nconnection with its distributions to\nshareholders, but may not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes. Foreign\nexchange transactions involve a significant\ndegree of risk and the markets in which\nforeign exchange transactions are effected may\nbe highly volatile, highly specialized and\nhighly technical. Significant changes,\nincluding changes in liquidity and prices, can\noccur in such markets within very short\nperiods of time, often within minutes. Foreign\nexchange trading risks include, but are not\nlimited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty\nrisk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and\npotential interference by foreign governments\nthrough regulation of local exchange markets,\nforeign investment or particular transactions\nin non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the correlation of\n\n3\n\nthe Fund's or an Underlying Fund's return with\nthe performance of its Underlying Index and\nmay lower an Underlying Fund\u2019s return. Each\nUnderlying Fund could experience losses if the\nvalue of its currency forwards, options or\nfutures positions were poorly correlated with\nits other investments or if it could not close\nout its positions because of an illiquid\nmarket or otherwise. In addition, each\nUnderlying Fund could incur transaction costs,\nincluding trading commissions, in connection\nwith certain non-U.S. currency transactions.\nDiversification Status. The Fund is classified\nas a diversified fund under the 1940 Act. This\nmeans that the Fund may not purchase\nsecurities of an issuer (other than (i)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\nand (ii) securities of other investment\ncompanies) if, with respect to 75% of its\ntotal assets, (a) more than 5% of the Fund\u2019s\ntotal assets would be invested in securities\nof that issuer or (b) the Fund would hold more\nthan 10% of the outstanding voting securities\nof that issuer. With respect to the remaining\n25% of its total assets, the Fund may invest\nmore than 5% of its assets in one issuer.\nUnder the 1940 Act, the Fund cannot change its\nclassification from diversified to non-\ndiversified without shareholder approval. The\nFund intends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S.\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective. Equity Securities. Equity\nsecurities generally have greater price\nvolatility than fixed-income securities. The\nmarket price of equity securities may go up or\ndown, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.\nEquity securities may decline in value due to\nfactors affecting equity securities markets\ngenerally; particular industries, sectors or\ngeographic regions represented in those\nmarkets; or individual issuers. The types of\ndevelopments that may affect an issuer of an\nequity security include management\nperformance, financial leverage and reduced\ndemand for the issuer's goods or services.\nCommon and preferred stock represent equity or\nownership interests in an issuer. Preferred\nstock, however, pays dividends at a specified\nrate and has precedence over common stock in\nthe payment of dividends. In the event an\nissuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy,\nthe claims of owners of bonds and preferred\nstock take precedence over the claims of those\nwho own common stock. Futures, Options on\nFutures and Securities Options. Futures\ncontracts, options on futures and securities\noptions may be used by the Fund and certain of\nthe Underlying Funds to simulate investment in\ntheir respective underlying indexes, to\nfacilitate trading or to reduce transaction\ncosts. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\nenter into futures contracts and options on\nfutures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nfutures exchange. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund will not use futures, options on futures\nor securities options for speculative\npurposes. The Fund and each Underlying Fund\nintends to use futures and options on futures\nin accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d )\npromulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act (\n\u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA, with respect to the Fund, has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d in\naccordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with\nrespect to the Fund or an Underlying Fund, is\nnot subject to registration or regulation as a\ncommodity pool operator under the CEA. See the\nRegulation Regarding Derivatives section of\nthis SAI for more information. Futures\ncontracts provide for the future sale by one\nparty and purchase by another party of a\nspecified amount of a specific instrument or\nindex at a specified future time and at a\nspecified price. Stock index contracts are\nbased on investments that reflect the market\nvalue of common stock of the firms included in\nthe investments. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund will be required to deposit\nwith the broker an amount of cash or cash\nequivalents known as \u201c initial margin, \u201d which\nis similar to a performance bond or good faith\ndeposit on the contract and is returned to the\nFund or an Underlying Fund upon termination of\nthe futures contract if all contractual\nobligations have been satisfied. Subsequent\npayments, known as \u201c variation margin, \u201d will\nbe made to and from the broker daily as the\nprice of the instrument or index underlying\nthe futures contract fluctuates, making the\nlong and short positions in the futures\ncontract more or less valuable, a process\nknown as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any time\nprior to the expiration of a futures contract,\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund may elect to\nclose the position by taking an opposite\nposition, which will operate to terminate the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of\n\n4\n\nthe futures position by the writer of the\noption to the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof the Fund or an Underlying Fund. The\npotential for loss related to writing call\noptions is unlimited. The potential for loss\nrelated to writing put options is limited to\nthe agreed-upon price per share, also known as\nthe \u201c strike price, \u201d less the premium\nreceived from writing the put. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may purchase and write put and\ncall options on futures contracts that are\ntraded on an exchange as a hedge against\nchanges in value of its portfolio securities\nor in anticipation of the purchase of\nsecurities, and may enter into closing\ntransactions with respect to such options to\nterminate existing positions. There is no\nguarantee that such closing transactions can\nbe effected. Securities options may be used by\nthe Fund to obtain access to securities in the\nUnderlying Index or to dispose of securities\nin the Underlying Index at favorable prices,\nto invest cash in a securities index that\noffers similar exposure to that provided by\nthe Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve\nthe Fund\u2019s objective of tracking the\nUnderlying Index. A call option gives a holder\nthe right to purchase a specific security at a\nspecified price ( \u201c exercise price \u201d ) within\na specified period of time. A put option gives\na holder the right to sell a specific security\nat an exercise price within a specified period\nof time. The initial purchaser of a call\noption pays the \u201c writer \u201d a premium, which is\npaid at the time of purchase and is retained\nby the writer whether or not such option is\nexercised. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\npurchase put options to hedge its portfolio\nagainst the risk of a decline in the market\nvalue of securities held and may purchase call\noptions to hedge against an increase in the\nprice of securities it is committed to\npurchase. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\nwrite put and call options along with a long\nposition in options to increase its ability to\nhedge against a change in the market value of\nthe securities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\npurchase or sell securities options on a U.S.\nor non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC\nmarket through a transaction with a dealer.\nOptions on a securities index are typically\nsettled on a net basis based on the\nappreciation or depreciation of the index\nlevel over the strike price. Options on single\nname securities may be cash- or physically-\nsettled, depending upon the market in which\nthey are traded. Options may be structured so\nas to be exercisable only on certain dates or\non a daily basis. Options may also be\nstructured to have conditions to exercise (\ni.e. , \u201c Knock-in Events \u201d ) or conditions\nthat trigger termination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out\nEvents \u201d ). High Yield Securities. The Fund\nand certain of the Underlying Funds may invest\nin non-investment grade securities. Non-\ninvestment grade or \u201c high yield \u201d fixed-\nincome or convertible securities are commonly\nknown to investors as \u201c junk bonds \u201d or \u201c high\nyield bonds. \u201d These are generally debt\nsecurities that are rated below investment\ngrade by one or more of the major rating\nagencies or are unrated securities that BFA\nbelieves are of comparable quality. While\ngenerally providing greater income and\nopportunity for gain, non-investment grade\ndebt securities may be subject to greater\nrisks than securities that have higher credit\nratings, including a high risk of default, and\ntheir yields will fluctuate over time. High\nyield securities will generally be in the\nlower rating categories of recognized rating\nagencies (rated below Baa3 by Moody's\nInvestors Service, Inc. ( \u201c Moody's \u201d ) or\nbelow BBB- by Standard & Poor's \u00ae Global\nRatings, a subsidiary of S&P Global ( \u201c S&P\nGlobal Ratings \u201d ) or Fitch Ratings, Inc. ( \u201c\nFitch \u201d )) or be unrated. The credit rating of\na high yield security does not necessarily\naddress its market value risk, and ratings may\nfrom time to time change, positively or\nnegatively, to reflect developments regarding\nthe issuer\u2019s financial condition. High yield\nsecurities are considered to be speculative\nwith respect to the capacity of the issuer to\ntimely repay principal and pay interest in\naccordance with the terms of the obligation\nand may have more credit risk than higher\nrated securities. The major risks of high\nyield bond investments include the following:\n\u2022 High yield bonds may be issued by less\ncreditworthy issuers. These securities are\nvulnerable to adverse changes in the issuer\u2019s\nindustry or to general economic conditions.\nIssuers of high yield bonds may be unable to\nmeet their interest or principal payment\nobligations because of an economic downturn,\nspecific issuer developments or the\nunavailability of additional financing. \u2022 The\nissuers of high yield bonds may have a larger\namount of outstanding debt relative to their\nassets than issuers of investment grade bonds.\nIf the issuer experiences financial stress, it\nmay be unable to meet its debt obligations.\nThe issuer\u2019s ability to pay its debt\nobligations also may be lessened by specific\nissuer developments, or the unavailability\n\n5\n\nof additional financing. Issuers of high yield\nsecurities are often in the growth stage of\ntheir development and/or involved in a\nreorganization or takeover. \u2022 High yield bonds\nare frequently ranked junior to claims by\nother creditors. If the issuer cannot meet its\nobligations, the senior obligations are\ngenerally paid off before the junior\nobligations, which will potentially limit the\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s ability to fully recover\nprincipal, to receive interest payments when\nsenior securities are in default or to receive\nrestructuring benefits paid to holders of more\nsenior classes of debt. Thus, investors in\nhigh yield securities frequently have a lower\ndegree of protection with respect to principal\nand interest payments than do investors in\nhigher rated securities. \u2022 High yield bonds\nfrequently have redemption features that\npermit an issuer to repurchase the security\nfrom the Underlying Fund before it matures. If\nan issuer redeems the high yield bonds, the\nUnderlying Fund may have to invest the\nproceeds in bonds with lower yields and may\nlose income. \u2022 Prices of high yield bonds are\nsubject to extreme fluctuations. Negative\neconomic developments may have a greater\nimpact on the prices of high yield bonds than\non those of other higher rated fixed-income\nsecurities. \u2022 Under certain economic and/or\nmarket conditions, the Underlying Fund may\nhave difficulty disposing of certain high\nyield securities due to the limited number of\ninvestors in that sector of the market. There\nare fewer dealers in the high yield bond\nmarket, and there may be significant\ndifferences in the prices quoted for high\nyield bonds by dealers, and such quotations\nmay not be the actual prices available for a\npurchase or sale. Judgment may play a greater\nrole in the prices and values generated for\nsuch securities than in the case of securities\ntrading in a more liquid market. \u2022 The\nsecondary markets for high yield securities\nare not as liquid as the secondary markets for\nhigher rated securities. The secondary markets\nfor high yield securities are concentrated in\nrelatively few market makers and, participants\nin the markets are mostly institutional\ninvestors, including insurance companies,\nbanks, other financial institutions and mutual\nfunds. In addition, the trading volume for\nhigh yield securities is generally lower than\nthat for higher rated securities and the\nsecondary markets could contract under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the condition\nof a particular issuer. Under certain economic\nand/or market conditions, the Underlying Fund\nmay have difficulty disposing of certain high\nyield securities due to the limited number of\ninvestors in that sector of the market. An\nilliquid secondary market may adversely affect\nthe market price of the high yield security,\nwhich may result in increased difficulty\nselling the particular issue and obtaining\naccurate market quotations on the issue when\nvaluing an Underlying Fund's assets. Market\nquotations on high yield securities are\navailable only from a limited number of\ndealers, and such quotations may not be the\nactual prices available for a purchase or\nsale. When the secondary market for high yield\nsecurities becomes more illiquid, or in the\nabsence of readily available market quotations\nfor such securities, the relative lack of\nreliable objective data makes it more\ndifficult to value such securities, and\njudgment plays a more important role in\ndetermining such valuations. \u2022 The Underlying\nFund may incur expenses to the extent\nnecessary to seek recovery upon default or to\nnegotiate new terms with a defaulting issuer.\n\u2022 The high yield bond markets may react\nstrongly to adverse news about an issuer or\nthe economy, or to the perception or\nexpectation of adverse news, whether or not it\nis based on fundamental analysis.\nAdditionally, prices for high yield securities\nmay be affected by legislative and regulatory\ndevelopments. These developments could\nadversely affect the Underlying Fund\u2019s NAV and\ninvestment practices, the secondary market for\nhigh yield securities, the financial condition\nof issuers of these securities and the value\nand liquidity of outstanding high yield\nsecurities, especially in a thinly traded\nmarket. For example, federal legislation\nrequiring the divestiture by federally insured\nsavings and loan associations of their\ninvestments in high yield bonds and limiting\nthe deductibility of interest by certain\ncorporate issuers of high yield bonds\nadversely affected the market in the past.\nInflation-Protected Obligations. Certain of\nthe Underlying Funds invest almost exclusively\nin inflation-protected public obligations of\nthe U.S. Treasury, commonly known as \u201c TIPS. \u201d\nTIPS are a type of U.S. government obligation\nissued by the U.S. Treasury that are designed\nto provide inflation protection to investors.\nTIPS are income-generating instruments whose\ninterest and principal payments are adjusted\nfor inflation - a sustained increase in prices\nthat erodes the purchasing power of money. The\ninflation adjustment, which is typically\napplied monthly to the principal of the bond,\nfollows a designated inflation index, the\nconsumer price index ( \u201c CPI \u201d ), and TIPS\u2019\nprincipal payments are adjusted according to\nchanges in the CPI. A fixed-coupon rate is\napplied to the inflation-adjusted principal so\nthat as inflation rises, both the principal\nvalue and the\n\n6\n\ninterest payments increase. This can provide\ninvestors with a hedge against inflation, as\nit helps preserve the purchasing power of an\ninvestment. Because of this inflation\nadjustment feature, inflation-protected bonds\ntypically have lower yields than conventional\nfixed-rate bonds. Investments in Underlying\nFunds. Each Underlying Fund is a type of\ninvestment company referred to as an exchange-\ntraded fund ( \u201c ETF \u201d ). Each Underlying Fund\nis designed to track a particular index and is\nadvised by BFA. Shares of the Underlying Funds\nare listed for trading on national securities\nexchanges and trade throughout the day on\nthose exchanges and other secondary markets.\nThere can be no assurance that the\nrequirements of the national securities\nexchanges necessary to maintain the listing of\nshares of the Underlying Funds will continue\nto be met. A national securities exchange may,\nbut is not required to, remove the shares of\nthe Underlying Funds from listing if, among\nother things: (i) following the initial\n12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of an Underlying Fund,\nthere are fewer than 50 record and/or\nbeneficial holders of the shares for 30 or\nmore consecutive trading days, (ii) the value\nof an Underlying Fund's underlying index is no\nlonger calculated or available, or (iii) any\nother event shall occur or condition exist\nthat, in the opinion of the national\nsecurities exchange, makes further dealings on\nthe national securities exchange inadvisable.\nA national securities exchange will remove the\nshares of an Underlying Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of such Underlying\nFund. Shares of each Underlying Fund trade on\nexchanges at prices at, above or below their\nmost recent NAV. The per share NAV of each\nUnderlying Fund is calculated at the end of\neach business day and fluctuates with changes\nin the market value of such Underlying Fund's\nholdings since the most recent calculation.\nThe trading prices of an Underlying Fund's\nshares fluctuate continuously throughout\ntrading hours based on market supply and\ndemand rather than NAV. The trading prices of\nan Underlying Fund's shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during periods of\nmarket volatility. Any of these factors may\nlead to an Underlying Fund's shares trading at\na premium or discount to NAV. Exchange prices\nare not expected to correlate exactly with an\nUnderlying Fund's NAV due to timing reasons as\nwell as market supply and demand factors. In\naddition, disruptions to an Underlying Fund's\ncreations and redemptions or the existence of\nextreme market volatility may result in\ntrading prices of Underlying Fund shares that\ndiffer significantly from NAV. If the Fund\npurchases shares of the Underlying Funds at a\ntime when the market price of an Underlying\nFund's shares are at a premium to the NAV or\nsells at a time when the market price of an\nUnderlying Fund is at a discount to the NAV,\nthen the Fund may sustain losses. As in the\ncase of other publicly-traded securities,\nbrokers' commissions on buying or selling\nshares of the Underlying Funds will be based\non negotiated commission rates at customary\nlevels. An investment in an ETF generally\npresents the same primary risks as an\ninvestment in an open-end investment company\nthat is not exchange-traded and that has the\nsame investment objectives, strategies, and\npolicies. However, ETFs are subject to the\nfollowing risks that do not apply to an open-\nend investment company that is not exchange-\ntraded: (i) the market price of the ETF's\nshares may trade at a discount to their net\nasset value; (ii) an active trading market for\nan ETF's shares may not develop or be\nmaintained; or (iii) trading of an ETF's\nshares may be halted if the listing exchange's\nofficials deem such action appropriate, the\nshares are delisted from the exchange, or the\nactivation of market-wide \u201c circuit breakers \u201d\n(which are tied to large swings in stock\nprices) halts stock trading generally. Lending\nPortfolio Securities. The Fund may lend\nportfolio securities to certain borrowers that\nBFA determines to be creditworthy, including\nborrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers\nprovide collateral that is maintained in an\namount at least equal to the current market\nvalue of the securities loaned. No securities\nloan shall be made on behalf of the Fund if,\nas a result, the aggregate value of all\nsecurities loans of the Fund exceeds one-third\nof the value of the Fund's total assets\n(including the value of the collateral\nreceived). The Fund may terminate a loan at\nany time and obtain the return of the\nsecurities loaned. The Fund receives, by way\nof substitute payment, the value of any\ninterest or cash or non-cash distributions\npaid on the loaned securities that it would\nhave otherwise received if the securities were\nnot on loan. With respect to loans that are\ncollateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount\nof cash collateral. The Fund or the Underlying\nFunds are compensated by any positive\ndifference between the amount earned on the\nreinvestment of cash collateral and the fee\npaid to the borrower. In the case of\ncollateral other than cash, the Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of the Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nOther investment companies in which a Fund or\nan Underlying Fund invests can be expected to\nincur fees and expenses for operations, such\nas investment advisory and administration\nfees, that would be in addition to those\nincurred by a Fund or an Underlying Fund.\n\n7\n\nThe Fund and Underlying Funds conduct their\nsecurities lending pursuant to an exemptive\norder from the SEC permitting them to lend\nportfolio securities to borrowers affiliated\nwith the Fund and to retain an affiliate of\nthe Fund to act as securities lending agent.\nTo the extent that the Fund engages in\nsecurities lending, BlackRock Institutional\nTrust Company, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d ) acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund, subject\nto the overall supervision of BFA. BTC\nadministers the lending program in accordance\nwith guidelines approved by the Trust's Board\nof Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the trustees of\nwhich are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ). JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d ) serves as\ncustodian for the Fund in connection with\ncertain securities lending activities.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk (\ni.e ., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk ( i.e ., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees the Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (\ni.e. , the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If the Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, the Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return the Fund\u2019s securities as agreed,\nthe Fund\u2019s ability to participate in a\ncorporate action event may be impacted, or the\nFund may experience losses if the proceeds\nreceived from liquidating the collateral do\nnot at least equal the value of the loaned\nsecurity at the time the collateral is\nliquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nThis latter event could trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. The Fund could lose\nmoney if its short-term investment of the\ncollateral declines in value over the period\nof the loan. Substitute payments received by\nthe Fund representing dividends paid on\nsecurities loaned out by the Fund will not be\nconsidered qualified dividend income. BTC will\ntake into account the tax effects on\nshareholders caused by this difference in\nconnection with the Fund\u2019s securities lending\nprogram. Substitute payments received on tax-\nexempt securities loaned out will not be tax-\nexempt income. There could also be changes in\nthe status of issuers under applicable laws\nand regulations, including tax regulations,\nthat may impact the regulatory or tax\ntreatment of loaned securities and could, for\nexample, result in a delay in the payment of\ndividend equivalent payments owed to the Fund\n(as permitted by applicable law). Regulations\nadopted by global prudential regulators\nrequire certain bank-regulated counterparties\nand certain of their affiliates to include in\ncertain financial contracts, including many\nsecurities lending agreements, terms that\ndelay or restrict the rights of\ncounterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate\nsuch agreements, foreclose upon collateral,\nexercise other default rights or restrict\ntransfers of credit support in the event that\nthe counterparty and/or its affiliates are\nsubject to certain types of resolution or\ninsolvency proceedings. It is possible that\nthese requirements, as well as potential\nadditional government regulation and other\ndevelopments in the market, could adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s ability to terminate\nexisting securities lending agreements or to\nrealize amounts to be received under such\nagreements. Liquidity Risk Management. Rule\n22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the \u201c\nLiquidity Rule \u201d ) requires open-end funds,\nincluding ETFs such as the Fund, to establish\na liquidity risk management program (the \u201c\nLiquidity Program \u201d ) and enhance disclosures\nregarding fund liquidity. As required by the\nLiquidity Rule, the Fund has implemented a\nLiquidity Program, and the Board, including a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees of the\nTrust, has appointed BFA as the administrator\nof the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity\nProgram, BFA assesses, manages, and\nperiodically reviews the Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nand classifies each investment held by the\nFund as a \u201c highly liquid investment, \u201d \u201c\nmoderately liquid investment, \u201d \u201c less liquid\ninvestment \u201d or \u201c illiquid investment. \u201d The\nLiquidity Rule defines \u201c liquidity risk \u201d as\nthe risk that the Fund could not meet requests\nto redeem shares issued by the Fund without\nsignificant dilution of the remaining\ninvestors\u2019 interest in the Fund. The liquidity\nof the Fund's portfolio investments is\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment-specific considerations under\nthe Liquidity Program. There are exclusions\nfrom certain portions of the liquidity risk\nmanagement program requirements for \u201c in-kind\n\u201d ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To\nthe extent that an investment is deemed to be\nan illiquid investment or a less liquid\ninvestment, the Fund can expect to be exposed\nto greater liquidity risk. Mortgage Pass-\nThrough Securities. Certain of the Underlying\nFunds may invest in mortgage pass-through\nsecurities, which are backed by pools of\nmortgages and issued by the Government\nNational Mortgage Association or by one of\nseveral U.S. government-sponsored enterprises,\nsuch as the Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d ), the Federal\nHome\n\n8\n\nLoan Mortgage Corporation ( \u201c Freddie Mac \u201d ),\nor the Federal Home Loan Banks ( \u201c FHLBs \u201d ).\nIn the basic mortgage pass-through structure,\nmortgages with similar issuer, term and coupon\ncharacteristics are collected and aggregated\ninto a \u201c pool \u201d consisting of multiple\nmortgage loans. The pool is assigned a CUSIP\nnumber and undivided interests in the pool are\ntraded and sold as pass-through securities.\nThe holder of the security is entitled to a\npro rata share of principal and interest\npayments (including unscheduled prepayments)\nfrom the pool of mortgage loans. Mortgage\nsecurities issued by non-government entities\nmay be subject to greater credit risk than\nthose issued by government entities. The\nperformance of privately-issued mortgage\nsecurities may depend on the integrity and\ncompetence of the institutions that originate\nthe underlying mortgages, yet investors in\nthese mortgage securities may have only\nlimited access to information required to\nevaluate the practices of these mortgage\noriginators. In order to prevent defaults by\ntroubled mortgage borrowers, the sponsors of\nmortgage securities may have to renegotiate\nand investors in mortgage securities may have\nto accept less favorable interest rates or\nother terms on the mortgages underlying these\nsecurities. Unanticipated mortgage defaults or\nrenegotiations of mortgage terms are likely to\ndepress the prices of related mortgage\nsecurities. Although mortgage securities may\nbe supported by some form of government or\nprivate guarantee and/or insurance, there is\nno assurance that private guarantors or\ninsurers will meet their obligations.\nGuarantees, insurance and other forms of\ncredit enhancement supporting mortgage\nsecurities may also be insufficient to cover\nall losses on underlying mortgages if mortgage\nborrowers default at a greater than expected\nrate. An investment in a specific pool of\npass-through securities requires an analysis\nof the specific prepayment risk of mortgages\nwithin the covered pool (since mortgagors\ntypically have the option to prepay their\nloans). The level of prepayments on a pool of\nmortgage securities is difficult to predict\nand can impact the subsequent cash flows and\nvalue of the mortgage pool. In addition, when\ntrading specific mortgage pools, precise\nexecution, delivery and settlement\narrangements must be negotiated for each\ntransaction. These factors combine to make\ntrading in mortgage pools somewhat cumbersome.\nFor these and other reasons, an Underlying\nFund may obtain exposure to U.S. agency\nmortgage pass-through securities primarily\nthrough the use of \u201c to-be-announced \u201d or \u201c\nTBA transactions. \u201d \u201c TBA \u201d refers to a\ncommonly used mechanism for the forward\nsettlement of U.S. agency mortgage pass-\nthrough securities, and not to a separate type\nof MBS. Most transactions in mortgage pass-\nthrough securities occur through the use of\nTBA transactions. TBA transactions generally\nare conducted in accordance with widely-\naccepted guidelines that establish commonly\nobserved terms and conditions for execution,\nsettlement and delivery. In a TBA transaction,\nthe buyer and seller decide on general trade\nparameters, such as agency, settlement date,\npar amount, and price. The actual pools\ndelivered generally are determined two days\nprior to the settlement date. An Underlying\nFund may use TBA transactions in several ways.\nFor example, an Underlying Fund may regularly\nenter into TBA agreements and \u201c roll over \u201d\nsuch agreements prior to the settlement date\nstipulated in such agreements. This type of\nTBA transaction is sometimes known as a \u201c TBA\nroll. \u201d In a \u201c TBA roll, \u201d an Underlying Fund\ngenerally will sell the obligation to purchase\nthe pools stipulated in the TBA agreement\nprior to the stipulated settlement date and\nwill enter into a new TBA agreement for future\ndelivery of pools of mortgage pass-through\nsecurities. In addition, an Underlying Fund\nmay enter into TBA agreements and settle such\ntransactions on the stipulated settlement date\nby accepting actual receipt or delivery of the\npools of mortgage pass-through securities\nstipulated in the TBA agreement. Default by or\nbankruptcy of a counterparty to a TBA\ntransaction would expose an Underlying Fund to\npossible loss because of adverse market\naction, expenses or delays in connection with\nthe purchase or sale of the pools of mortgage\npass-through securities specified in the TBA\ntransaction. To minimize this risk, an\nUnderlying Fund will enter into TBA\ntransactions only with established\ncounterparties (such as major broker-dealers)\nand BFA will monitor the creditworthiness of\nsuch counterparties. The use of \u201c TBA rolls \u201d\nmay cause an Underlying Fund to experience\nhigher portfolio turnover and to pay higher\ncapital gain distributions, which may result\nin larger amounts of short-term capital gains\nallocable to interest holders. The Underlying\nFunds maintain liquid assets in connection\nwith TBA transactions. Mortgage Securities.\nCertain of the Underlying Funds may invest in\nmortgage securities. Mortgage securities are\nissued by government and non-government\nentities such as banks, mortgage lenders, or\nother institutions. A mortgage security is an\nobligation of the issuer that is backed by a\nmortgage or pool of mortgages or a direct\ninterest in an underlying pool of mortgages.\nSome mortgage securities, such as\ncollateralized mortgage obligations, make\npayments of both principal and interest at a\nrange of specified intervals; others make\nsemi-annual interest payments at a pre-\ndetermined rate and repay principal at\nmaturity (like a typical bond). Mortgage\nsecurities are based on different types of\nmortgages, including those on commercial real\nestate or residential properties. Stripped\nmortgage securities are created when the\ninterest and principal components of a\nmortgage security are separated and sold as\nindividual securities. In the case of a\nstripped mortgage security, the holder of the\n\u201c principal-only \u201d security (PO) receives the\nprincipal payments made by the underlying\nmortgage, while the holder of the \u201c interest-\nonly \u201d security (IO) receives interest\npayments from the same underlying mortgage.\n\n9\n\nThe value of mortgage securities may change\ndue to shifts in the market's perception of\nthe creditworthiness of issuers and changes in\ninterest rates or liquidity. The value of some\nMBS may be particularly sensitive to changes\nin prevailing interest rates. In addition,\nregulatory or tax changes may adversely affect\nthe mortgage securities market as a whole.\nMortgage securities issued by non-government\nentities may be subject to greater credit risk\nthan those issued by government entities. The\nperformance of privately-issued mortgage\nsecurities may depend on the integrity and\ncompetence of the institutions that originate\nthe underlying mortgages, yet investors in\nthese mortgage securities may have only\nlimited access to information required to\nevaluate the practices of these mortgage\noriginators. In order to prevent defaults by\ntroubled mortgage borrowers, the sponsors of\nmortgage securities may have to renegotiate\nand investors in mortgage securities may have\nto accept less favorable interest rates or\nother terms on the mortgages underlying these\nsecurities. Unanticipated mortgage defaults or\nrenegotiations of mortgage terms are likely to\ndepress the prices of related mortgage\nsecurities. Although mortgage securities may\nbe supported by some form of government or\nprivate guarantee and/or insurance, there is\nno assurance that private guarantors or\ninsurers will meet their obligations.\nGuarantees, insurance and other forms of\ncredit enhancement supporting mortgage\nsecurities may also be insufficient to cover\nall losses on underlying mortgages if mortgage\nborrowers default at a greater than expected\nrate. Non-government mortgage securities may\nbe subject to greater price changes than\ngovernment issues. Mortgage securities are\nsubject to prepayment risk. Prepayment risk is\nthe risk that early principal payments made on\nthe underlying mortgages, usually in response\nto a reduction in interest rates, will result\nin the return of principal to the investor,\ncausing the investor to be invested\nsubsequently at a lower current interest rate.\nAlternatively, in a rising interest rate\nenvironment, mortgage security values may be\nadversely affected when prepayments on\nunderlying mortgages do not occur as\nanticipated, resulting in the extension of the\nsecurity's effective maturity and the related\nincrease in interest rate sensitivity of a\nlonger-term instrument. The prices of stripped\nmortgage securities tend to be more volatile\nin response to changes in interest rates than\nthose of non-stripped mortgage securities. In\naddition, although mortgages and mortgage-\nrelated securities are generally supported by\nsome form of government or private guarantee\nand/or insurance, there is no assurance that\nprivate guarantors or insurers will meet their\nobligations. Non-Diversification Risk. Certain\nof the Underlying Funds may be classified as \u201c\nnon-diversified. \u201d This means that the\nUnderlying Funds may invest a large percentage\nof its assets in securities issued by or\nrepresenting a small number of issuers. As a\nresult, the Underlying Funds may be more\nsusceptible to the risks associated with these\nparticular issuers or to a single economic,\npolitical or regulatory occurrence affecting\nthese issuers. Non-U.S. Securities and\nEmerging Markets Securities. Certain of the\nUnderlying Funds may invest in the securities\nof non-U.S. issuers, which involves special\nrisks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in U.S. issuers.\nThese include differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards,\nthe possibility of expropriation or\npotentially confiscatory taxation, adverse\nchanges in investment or exchange control\nregulations, political instability which could\naffect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries,\npotential restrictions of the flow of\ninternational capital, generally less liquid\nand less efficient securities markets,\ngenerally greater price volatility, less\npublicly available information about issuers,\nhigher transaction and custody costs, delays\nand risks attendant in settlement procedures,\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual\nobligations, less developed judicial systems\nto settle disputes, lesser liquidity and\nsignificantly smaller market capitalization of\nmost non-U.S. securities markets, substantial\ngovernment interference with the economy and\ntransaction costs of foreign currency\nconversions. The Underlying Funds may have\ndifficulty valuing such securities due to\nthese or other considerations. Non-U.S.\nissuers may be subject to less governmental\nregulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover,\nindividual foreign economies may differ\nfavorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy\nwith respect to growth of gross domestic\nproduct ( \u201c GDP \u201d ), rate of inflation,\ncapital reinvestment, resource self-\nsufficiency and balance of payment positions.\nIn addition, changes in foreign exchange rates\nalso will affect the value of securities\ndenominated or quoted in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar. Certain foreign markets have\nspecific geographical risks such as a\nheightened likelihood of earthquakes,\ntsunamis, or volcanoes. Certain foreign\nmarkets also experience acts of terrorism,\nterritorial disputes or other defense\nconcerns. These situations may have a\nsignificant impact on the economies of, and\ninvestments in, these geographic areas. To the\nextent an Underlying Fund invests in publicly\ntraded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers,\ncertain investments in such stocks may be in\nthe form of American Depositary Receipts ( \u201c\nADRs \u201d ), Global Depositary Receipts ( \u201c GDRs\n\u201d ) and European Depositary Receipts ( \u201c EDRs\n\u201d ) (collectively, \u201c depositary receipts \u201d ).\nDepositary receipts are receipts, typically\nissued by a bank or trust issuer, which\nevidence ownership of underlying securities\nissued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary\nreceipts may not necessarily be denominated in\nthe same currency as their underlying\nsecurities. ADRs typically are issued by a\nU.S. bank or trust company and evidence\nownership of underlying securities issued by a\nforeign corporation. EDRs, which are sometimes\nreferred to as Continental depositary\nreceipts, are receipts issued in Europe,\ntypically by foreign banks and trust\ncompanies,\n\n10\n\nthat evidence ownership of either foreign or\ndomestic underlying securities. GDRs are\ndepositary receipts structured like global\ndebt issues to facilitate trading on an\ninternational basis. Generally, ADRs, issued\nin registered form, are designed for use in\nthe U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, in\nbearer form, are designed for use in European\nsecurities markets. GDRs are tradable both in\nthe U.S. and in Europe and are designed for\nuse throughout the world. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may invest in depositary\nreceipts through \u201c sponsored \u201d or \u201c\nunsponsored \u201d facilities. A sponsored facility\nis established jointly by the issuer of the\nunderlying security and a depositary, whereas\na depositary may establish an unsponsored\nfacility without participation by the issuer\nof the deposited security. Holders of\nunsponsored depositary receipts generally bear\nall the costs of such facilities and the\ndepositary of an unsponsored facility\nfrequently is under no obligation to\ndistribute interest holder communications\nreceived from the issuer of the deposited\nsecurity or to pass through voting rights to\nthe holders of such receipts in respect of the\ndeposited securities. The issuers of\nunsponsored depositary receipts are not\nobligated to disclose material information in\nthe U.S. and, therefore, there may be less\ninformation available regarding such issuers\nand there may not be a correlation between\nsuch information and the market value of the\ndepositary receipts. Depositary receipts are\ngenerally subject to the same risks as the\nforeign securities that they evidence or into\nwhich they may be converted. In addition to\ninvestment risks associated with the\nunderlying issuer, depositary receipts expose\neach Underlying Fund to additional risks\nassociated with the non-uniform terms that\napply to depositary receipt programs, credit\nexposure to the depository bank and to the\nsponsors and other parties with whom the\ndepository bank establishes the programs,\ncurrency risk and liquidity risk. Unsponsored\nprograms, which are not sanctioned by the\nissuer of the underlying common stock,\ngenerally expose investors to greater risks\nthan sponsored programs and do not provide\nholders with many of the shareholder benefits\nthat come from investing in sponsored\ndepositary receipts. Obligations of Foreign\nGovernments, Supranational Entities and Banks\n. The Fund and certain of the Underlying Funds\nmay invest in U.S. dollar-denominated short-\nterm obligations issued or guaranteed by one\nor more foreign governments or any of their\npolitical subdivisions, agencies or\ninstrumentalities that are determined by BFA\nto be of comparable quality to the other\nobligations in which such Underlying Funds may\ninvest. Certain foreign governments,\nspecifically foreign governments in emerging\nmarkets, historically have encountered\ndifficulties in servicing their debt\nobligations, withheld payments of principal\nand interest, and declared moratoria on the\npayment of principal and interest on their\nsovereign debts. Certain of the Underlying\nFunds may also invest in debt obligations of\nsupranational entities. Supranational entities\ninclude international organizations designated\nor supported by governmental entities to\npromote economic reconstruction or development\nand international banking institutions and\nrelated government agencies. Examples include\nthe International Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment (the World Bank), the Asian\nDevelopment Bank and the InterAmerican\nDevelopment Bank. The percentage of the\nUnderlying Funds\u2019 assets invested in\nobligations of foreign governments and\nsupranational entities will vary depending on\nthe relative yields of such securities, the\neconomic and financial markets of the\ncountries in which the investments are made\nand the interest rate climate of such\ncountries. Certain of the Underlying Funds may\ninvest a portion of their total assets in\nhigh-quality, short-term (one year or less)\ndebt obligations of foreign branches of U.S.\nbanks or U.S. branches of foreign banks that\nare denominated in and pay interest in U.S.\ndollars. Emerging Markets. Some non-U.S.\nmarkets in which certain of the Underlying\nFunds invest are considered to be emerging\nmarkets. Investment in these emerging markets\nsubjects an Underlying Fund to a greater risk\nof loss than investments in developed markets.\nThis is due to, among other things, greater\nmarket volatility, lower trading volume,\npolitical and economic instability, greater\nrisk of market shut down and more governmental\nlimitations on foreign investment policy than\nthose typically found in developed markets.\nRatings. An investment-grade rating generally\nmeans the security or issuer is rated\ninvestment-grade by one or more of Moody\u2019s,\nS&P Global Ratings, Fitch, or another credit\nrating agency designated as a nationally\nrecognized statistical rating organization ( \u201c\nNRSRO \u201d ) by the SEC, or is unrated but\nconsidered to be of equivalent quality by BFA.\nGenerally, bonds rated Baa3 or above by\nMoody\u2019s or BBB- or above by S&P Global Ratings\nand Fitch are considered \u201c investment-grade \u201d\nsecurities, bonds rated Baa are considered\nmedium grade obligations subject to moderate\ncredit risk and may possess certain\nspeculative characteristics, while bonds rated\nBBB are regarded as having adequate capacity\nto meet financial commitments. Subsequent to\npurchase by the applicable Underlying Fund, a\nrated security may cease to be rated or its\nrating may be reduced below an investment-\ngrade rating. Bonds rated below Baa3 by\nMoody\u2019s or below BBB- by S&P Global Ratings or\nFitch are generally considered below\ninvestment-grade quality and are obligations\nof issuers that are generally considered\npredominantly speculative with respect to the\nissuer\u2019s capacity to pay interest and repay\nprincipal according to the terms of the\nobligation and, therefore, carry greater\ninvestment risk, including the possibility of\nissuer default and bankruptcy and increased\nmarket price volatility. Such lower-rated\nsecurities are commonly referred to as \u201c junk\nbonds \u201d and are subject to a\n\n11\n\nsubstantial degree of credit risk. Please see\nAppendix B of this SAI for a description of\neach rating category of Moody's, S&P Global\nRatings and Fitch. Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives. The CFTC subjects advisers to\nregistered investment companies to regulation\nby the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the\nadviser either (i) invests, directly or\nindirectly, more than a prescribed level of\nits liquidation value in CFTC-regulated\nfutures, options and swaps ( \u201c CFTC\nDerivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent the Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. BFA is not, therefore,\nsubject to registration or regulation as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. The Fund (the \u201c No-Action\nLetter Fund \u201d ) may also have investments in \u201c\nunderlying funds \u201d (and such underlying funds\nthemselves may invest in underlying funds) not\nadvised by BFA (the term \u201c underlying fund \u201d\nfor purposes of the no-action letter\nreferenced below may include, but is not\nlimited to, certain securitized vehicles,\nmortgage or international real estate\ninvestment trusts, business development\ncompanies and, investment companies that may\ninvest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of the\nforegoing), and therefore may be viewed by the\nCFTC as commodity pools. BFA may not have\ntransparency into the holdings of these\nunderlying funds because they are not advised\nby BFA. To address this issue of lack of\ntransparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-\naction letter on November 29, 2012 permitting\nthe adviser of a fund that invests in such\nunderlying funds and that would otherwise have\nfiled a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC\nRule 4.5 to delay registration as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d until six months\nfrom the date on which the CFTC issues\nadditional guidance on the treatment of CFTC\nDerivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the\nadviser of the No-Action Letter Fund, has\nfiled a claim with the CFTC for such fund to\nrely on this no-action relief. Accordingly,\nBFA is not currently subject to registration\nor regulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA in respect of such fund.\nDerivative contracts, including, without\nlimitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-\ndeliverable forwards, are subject to\nregulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act ( \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under comparable\nregimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.\njurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards\nand certain other derivatives traded in the\nOTC market are subject to variation margin and\ninitial margin requirements. Implementation of\nthe margining and other provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory\ntrading, reporting and documentation of swaps\nand other derivatives have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact the costs to the Fund of\ntrading these instruments and, as a result,\nmay affect returns to investors in the Fund.\nRule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act\npermits the Fund to enter into Derivatives\nTransactions (as defined below) and certain\nother transactions notwithstanding the\nrestrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior\nsecurities \u201d under Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act. Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act, among other things,\nprohibits open-end funds, including the Funds,\nfrom issuing or selling any \u201c senior security,\n\u201d other than borrowing from a bank (subject to\na requirement to maintain 300% \u201c asset\ncoverage \u201d ). Under Rule 18f-4, \u201c Derivatives\nTransactions \u201d include the following: (1) any\nswap, security-based swap (including a\ncontract for differences), futures contract,\nforward contract, option (excluding purchased\noptions), any combination of the foregoing, or\nany similar instrument, under which the Fund\nis or may be required to make any payment or\ndelivery of cash or other assets during the\nlife of the instrument or at maturity or early\ntermination, whether as margin or settlement\npayment or otherwise; (2) any short sale\nborrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions ( e.g. ,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nand borrowed bonds), if the Fund elects to\ntreat these transactions as Derivatives\nTransactions under Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-\nissued or forward-settling securities ( e.g. ,\nfirm and standby commitments, including to-be-\nannounced ( \u201c TBA \u201d ) commitments, and dollar\nrolls) and non-standard settlement cycle\nsecurities, unless the Fund intends to\nphysically settle the transaction and the\ntransaction will settle within 35 days of its\ntrade date (the \u201c Delayed-Settlement\nSecurities Provision \u201d ). Unless the Fund is\nrelying on the Limited Derivatives User\nException (as defined below), the Fund must\ncomply with Rule 18f-4 with respect to its\nDerivatives Transactions. Rule 18f-4, among\nother things, requires the Fund to adopt and\nimplement a comprehensive written derivatives\nrisk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d ) and\ncomply with a relative or absolute limit on\nFund leverage risk calculated based on value-\nat-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is administered\nby a \u201c derivatives risk manager, \u201d who is\n\n12\n\nappointed by the Board, including a majority\nof Independent Directors/Trustees, and\nperiodically reviews the DRMP and reports to\nthe Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if the Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Repurchase\nAgreements. A repurchase agreement is an\ninstrument under which the purchaser ( i.e. ,\nan Underlying Fund) acquires a security and\nthe seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to\nrepurchase the security at a mutually agreed-\nupon time and price, thereby determining the\nyield during the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by an Underlying Fund but only to\nconstitute collateral for the seller\u2019s\nobligation to pay the repurchase price, and,\nin the event of a default by the seller, the\nUnderlying Fund may suffer time delays and\nincur costs or losses in connection with the\ndisposition of the collateral. In any\nrepurchase transaction, the collateral for a\nrepurchase agreement may include: (i) cash\nitems; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S.\ngovernment or its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that,\nat the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for\nan Underlying Fund, should it decide to\nutilize them. Such risks are not unique to the\nUnderlying Funds, but are inherent in\nrepurchase agreements. The Underlying Funds\nseek to minimize such risks, but because of\nthe inherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, an\nUnderlying Fund would likely retain the status\nof an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (\ni.e. , the position an Underlying Fund would\nnormally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to\nits investment policies, other unsecured debt\nsecurities of the defaulting counterparty)\nwith respect to the amount of the shortfall.\nAs an unsecured creditor, an Underlying Fund\nwould be at risk of losing some or all of the\nprincipal and income involved in the\ntransaction. Reverse Repurchase Agreements.\nReverse repurchase agreements involve the sale\nof securities with an agreement to repurchase\nthe securities at an agreed-upon price, date\nand interest payment and have the\ncharacteristics of borrowing. Generally, the\neffect of such transactions is that each\nUnderlying Fund can recover all or most of the\ncash invested in the portfolio securities\ninvolved during the term of the reverse\nrepurchase agreement, while in many cases the\nUnderlying Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are advantageous\nonly if each Underlying Fund has an\nopportunity to earn a rate of interest on the\ncash derived from these transactions that is\ngreater than the interest cost of obtaining\nthe same amount of cash. Opportunities to\nrealize earnings from the use of the proceeds\nequal to or greater than the interest required\nto be paid may not always be available, and\neach Underlying Fund intends to use the\nreverse repurchase technique only when BFA\nbelieves it will be advantageous to the\nUnderlying Fund. The use of reverse repurchase\nagreements may exaggerate any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund and each\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s assets. The use of reverse\nrepurchase agreements is a form of leverage,\nand the proceeds obtained through reverse\nrepurchase agreements may be invested in\nadditional securities. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits each Underlying\nFund to enter into reverse repurchase\nagreements and similar financing transactions\n( e.g., recourse and non-recourse tender\noption bonds, borrowed bonds) notwithstanding\nthe limitation on the issuance of senior\nsecurities in Section 18 of the Investment\nCompany Act, provided that each Underlying\nFund either (i) complies with the 300% asset\ncoverage ratio with respect to such\ntransactions and any other borrowings in the\naggregate, or (ii) treats such transactions as\nDerivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4.\n(See \u201c Regulation Regarding Derivatives \u201d\nabove.)\n\n13\n\nSecurities of Investment Companies. Each\nUnderlying Fund may invest in the securities\nof other investment companies (including money\nmarket funds) to the extent permitted by law,\nregulation, exemptive order or SEC staff\nguidance. Under the 1940 Act, a fund\u2019s\ninvestment in investment companies is limited\nto, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of\nthe total outstanding voting stock of any one\ninvestment company, (ii) 5% of the fund\u2019s\ntotal assets with respect to any one\ninvestment company, and (iii) 10% of the\nfund\u2019s total assets with respect to investment\ncompanies in the aggregate. Other investment\ncompanies in which an Underlying Fund invests\ncan be expected to incur fees and expenses for\noperations, such as investment advisory and\nadministration fees, which would be in\naddition to those incurred by an Underlying\nFund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC\nstaff, fees and expenses of money market funds\nused for cash collateral received in\nconnection with loans of securities are not\ntreated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nwhich reflect the Fund's pro rata share of the\nfees and expenses incurred by investing in\nother investment companies (as disclosed in\nthe Prospectus, as applicable). An Underlying\nFund may purchase shares of ETFs for the same\nreason it would purchase (and as an\nalternative to purchasing) futures contracts \u2013\nto obtain relatively low-cost exposure to the\nstock market while maintaining flexibility to\nmeet the liquidity needs of the Underlying\nFund. ETF shares enjoy several advantages over\nfutures contracts. Depending on the market,\nthe holding period, and other factors, ETF\nshares can be less costly than futures\ncontracts. In addition, ETF shares can be\npurchased for smaller sums and offer exposure\nto market sectors and styles for which there\nis no suitable or liquid futures contract. An\nUnderlying Fund may also purchase ETF shares\nfor other purposes, including improving its\nability to track its underlying index. An\nUnderlying Fund may invest in shares of ETFs\nthat are advised by BFA. Short-Term\nInstruments and Temporary Investments. The\nFund and the Underlying Funds may invest in\nshort-term instruments, including money market\ninstruments, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include, but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by BFA or otherwise\naffiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued\nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities (including\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit, bankers\u2019\nacceptances, fixed-time deposits and other\nobligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks\n(including non-U.S. branches) and similar\ninstitutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at\nthe date of purchase, \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by Moody's,\n\u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch, or \u201c A-1 \u201d by S&P Global\nRatings, or if unrated, of comparable quality\nas determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible\ncorporate debt securities ( e.g. , bonds and\ndebentures) with remaining maturities at the\ndate of purchase of not more than 397 days and\nthat have been determined to present minimal\ncredit risks, in accordance with the\nrequirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the\n1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and\n(vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated\nobligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S.\nbranches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of\ncomparable quality to obligations of U.S.\nbanks that may be purchased by the Fund. Any\nof these instruments may be purchased on a\ncurrent or forward-settled basis. Time\ndeposits are non-negotiable deposits\nmaintained in banking institutions for\nspecified periods of time at stated interest\nrates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances are time drafts\ndrawn on commercial banks by borrowers,\nusually in connection with international\ntransactions. Sovereign Obligations. Certain\nof the Underlying Funds may invest in\nsovereign obligations. An investment in\nsovereign debt obligations involves special\nrisks not present in corporate debt\nobligations. Sovereign debt includes\nsecurities issued or guaranteed by a foreign\nsovereign government. The issuer of the\nsovereign debt that controls the repayment of\nthe debt may be unable or unwilling to repay\nprincipal or interest when due, and the\nUnderlying Fund may have limited recourse in\nthe event of a default. Similar to other\nissuers, changes to the financial condition or\ncredit rating of a non-U.S. government may\ncause the value of a sovereign debt to\ndecline. During periods of economic\nuncertainty, the market prices of sovereign\ndebt obligations may be more volatile than\nprices of U.S. debt obligations, which may\naffect the Underlying Fund's NAV. Several\nsovereign issuers have experienced volatility\nand adverse trends due to concerns about\nrising government debt levels, including\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. A\nsovereign debtor's willingness or ability to\nrepay principal and pay interest in a timely\nmanner may be affected by, among other\nfactors, its cash flow situation, the extent\nof its non-U.S. currency reserves, the\navailability of sufficient foreign exchange,\nthe relative size of the debt service burden,\nthe sovereign debtor's policy toward principal\ninternational lenders and local political\nconstraints. The failure of a sovereign debtor\nto implement economic reforms, achieve\nspecified levels of economic performance or\nrepay principal or interest when due may\nresult in the cancellation of third-party\ncommitments to lend funds to the sovereign\ndebtor, which may further impair such debtor's\nability or willingness to service its debts.\nSwap Agreements. Swap agreements are contracts\nbetween parties in which one party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the other party\nbased on a pre-determined underlying\ninvestment or notional amount. In return, the\nother party agrees to make periodic payments\nto the first party based on the return (or a\ndifferential in rate of return) earned or\nrealized on the\n\n14\n\nunderlying investment or notional amount. Swap\nagreements will usually be performed on a net\nbasis, with each Underlying Fund receiving or\npaying only the net amount of the two\npayments. The net amount of the excess, if\nany, of an Underlying Fund\u2019s obligations over\nits entitlements with respect to each swap is\naccrued on a daily basis. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may enter into swap\nagreements, including currency swaps, interest\nrate swaps and index swaps. The use of swaps\nis a highly specialized activity that involves\ninvestment techniques and risks different from\nthose associated with ordinary portfolio\nsecurity transactions. These transactions\ngenerally do not involve the delivery of\nsecurities or other underlying assets.\nTracking Stocks. A tracking stock is a\nseparate class of common stock whose value is\nlinked to a specific business unit or\noperating division within a larger company and\nis designed to \u201c track \u201d the performance of\nsuch business unit or division. The tracking\nstock may pay dividends to shareholders\nindependent of the parent company. The parent\ncompany, rather than the business unit or\ndivision, generally is the issuer of tracking\nstock. However, holders of the tracking stock\nmay not have the same rights as holders of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock. U.S. Government\nObligations. The Fund or an Underlying Fund\nmay invest in various types of U.S. government\nobligations. U.S. government obligations are a\ntype of bond and include securities issued or\nguaranteed as to principal and interest by the\nU.S. government, its agencies or\ninstrumentalities. Payment of principal and\ninterest on U.S. government obligations (i)\nmay be backed by the full faith and credit of\nthe U.S. or (ii) may be backed solely by the\nissuing or guaranteeing agency or\ninstrumentality itself (as with Fannie Mae,\nFreddie Mac and FHLB notes). In the latter\ncase, the Fund or an Underlying Fund must look\nprincipally to the agency or instrumentality\nissuing or guaranteeing the obligation for\nultimate repayment, which agency or\ninstrumentality may be privately owned. There\ncan be no assurance that the U.S. government\nwould provide financial support to its\nagencies or instrumentalities where it is not\nobligated to do so. As a general matter, the\nvalue of debt instruments, including U.S.\ngovernment obligations, declines when market\ninterest rates increase and rises when market\ninterest rates decrease. Certain types of U.S.\ngovernment obligations are subject to\nfluctuations in yield or value due to their\nstructure or contract terms. Future\nDevelopments. The board of each Fund or\nUnderlying Fund may, in the future, authorize\neach Underlying Fund to invest in securities\ncontracts and investments, other than those\nlisted in this SAI and in the Prospectus,\nprovided they are consistent with the\nUnderlying Fund's investment objective and do\nnot violate any of its investment restrictions\nor policies. General Considerations and Risks\nA discussion of some of the principal risks\nassociated with an investment in the Fund is\ncontained in the Prospectus. Because the Fund\nexpects to obtain its exposure to the\nsecurities in the Underlying Index\nsubstantially through its investment in the\nUnderlying Funds, shareholders should be aware\nthat the risks of investment in particular\ntypes of securities, economic sectors and\ngeographic locations discussed below may be\nborne by the Fund through its investment in\nthe Underlying Funds. Through its investment\nin the Underlying Funds, the Fund will also\nbear the risks described below associated with\nthe Underlying Funds' use of portfolio\nmanagement techniques, such as borrowing\narrangements and use of derivatives, in\naddition to the risks associated with those\nactivities if the Funds engage in them\ndirectly. An investment in the Fund should be\nmade with an understanding that the value of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio securities, including its\ninvestment in the Underlying Funds, may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of stocks in\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Agency Debt Risk. The\nFund or an Underlying Fund may invest in\nunsecured bonds or debentures issued by U.S.\ngovernment agencies. Bonds or debentures\nissued by U.S. government agencies, including\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are generally\nbacked only by the general creditworthiness\nand reputation of the government agency\nissuing the bond or debenture and are not\nbacked by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. government. Ginnie Mae securities are\ngenerally backed by the full faith and credit\nof the U.S. government. Some government\nagencies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac, purchase and guarantee residential\nmortgages and form MBS that they issue to the\nmarket. These agencies also hold their own MBS\nas well as those of other institutions with\nfunding from the agency debentures they issue.\nRecent events in the markets for MBS have\nadversely affected the value of those MBS held\nand/or issued by these agencies.\n\n15\n\nThese securities are subject to more credit\nrisk than U.S. government securities that are\nsupported by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. ( e.g. , U.S. Treasury bonds). Borrowing\nRisk. Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the\nNAV of Fund shares and in the return on the\nFund\u2019s portfolio. Borrowing will cause the\nFund to incur interest expense and other fees.\nThe costs of borrowing may reduce the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. Borrowing may cause the Fund to\nliquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy its\nobligations. Call Risk. During periods of\nfalling interest rates, an issuer of a\ncallable bond held by the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may \u201c call \u201d or repay the\nsecurity before its stated maturity, and the\nFund or an Underlying Fund may have to\nreinvest the proceeds in securities with lower\nyields, which would result in a decline in\nincome, or in securities with greater risks or\nwith other less favorable features. Custody\nRisk. Custody risk refers to the risks\ninherent in the process of clearing and\nsettling trades and to the holding of\nsecurities, cash and other assets by local\nbanks, agents and depositories. Low trading\nvolumes and volatile prices in less developed\nmarkets make trades harder to complete and\nsettle, and governments or trade groups may\ncompel local agents to hold securities in\ndesignated depositories that may not be\nsubject to independent evaluation. Local\nagents are held only to the standards of care\nof their local markets, and thus may be\nsubject to limited or no government oversight.\nCommunications between the U.S. and emerging\nmarket countries may be unreliable, increasing\nthe risk of delayed settlements or losses of\nsecurity certificates. In general, the less\ndeveloped a country\u2019s securities market is,\nthe greater the likelihood of custody\nproblems. Practices in relation to the\nsettlement of securities transactions in\nemerging markets involve higher risks than\nthose in developed markets, in part because of\nthe use of brokers and counterparties that are\noften less well capitalized, and custody and\nregistration of assets in some countries may\nbe unreliable. The possibility of fraud,\nnegligence or undue influence being exerted by\nthe issuer or refusal to recognize ownership\nexists in some emerging markets, and, along\nwith other factors, could result in ownership\nregistration being lost. In addition, the laws\nof certain countries may put limits on the\nFund\u2019s ability to recover its assets if a\nforeign bank or depository or issuer of a\nsecurity or an agent of any of the foregoing\ngoes bankrupt. The Fund would absorb any loss\nresulting from such custody problems and may\nhave no successful claim for compensation.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. The Fund may not\nacquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, the Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that the Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nThe liquidity of an investment will be\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment specific considerations as set\nout in the Liquidity Program as required by\nthe Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may\ntrade at a discount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and the Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of the Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Issuer Insolvency\nRisk. The Fund's and the Underlying Funds'\npotential exposure to financially or\noperationally troubled issuers involves a high\ndegree of credit and market risk, which may be\nheightened during an economic downturn or\nrecession. Should an issuer of securities held\nby an Underlying Fund become involved in a\nbankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or\nfinancial restructuring, a wide variety of\nconsiderations make an evaluation of the\noutcome of an Underlying Fund\u2019s exposure to\nthe issuer uncertain. During the period of a\nbankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or\nfinancial restructuring, it is unlikely that\nthe Fund or the Underlying Funds will receive\nany interest payments on the securities of the\nissuer. The Fund or the Underlying Funds will\nbe subject to significant uncertainty as to\nwhether the reorganization or restructuring\nwill be completed, and the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds may bear certain\nextraordinary expenses to protect and recover\nits investment. The Fund or the Underlying\nFunds will also be subject to significant\nuncertainty as to when and in what manner and\nfor what value the obligations evidenced by\nthe securities of the issuer held by the\nUnderlying Funds will eventually be satisfied.\nEven if a plan of reorganization or\nrestructuring is adopted with respect to the\nsecurities of the issuer held by the Fund or\nthe Underlying Funds, there can be no\nassurance that the securities or other assets\nreceived by the Underlying Funds in connection\nwith such plan of reorganization or\nrestructuring will not have a lower value or\nincome potential than may have been\nanticipated or no value. The Underlying Funds\nmay be unable to enforce their claims or\nrights in any collateral or may have its\nclaims or security interest in any collateral\nchallenged, disallowed or subordinated to the\nclaims or security interests of other\ncreditors. In addition, amendments to the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or other relevant laws could\nalter the expected outcome or introduce\n\n16\n\ngreater uncertainty regarding the outcome of\nthe Underlying Funds' securities holdings in\nthe issuer. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a\nreorganization or restructuring, the\nsecurities of the issuer held by the\nUnderlying Funds could be re-characterized, or\nthe Underlying Funds may receive different\nsecurities or other assets, including equity\nsecurities. These types of equity securities\ninclude, but are not limited to: common stock;\npreferred stock (including convertible\npreferred stock); bonds, notes and debentures\nconvertible into common or preferred stock;\nstock purchase warrants and rights; equity\ninterests in trusts; and depositary receipts.\nThe value of equity securities received by the\nFund or the Underlying Funds could decline if\nthe financial condition of the issuer\ndeteriorates or if overall market and economic\nconditions, or conditions within the issuer\u2019s\nregion or industry, deteriorate. Equity\nsecurities received by an Underlying Fund\nthrough a bankruptcy proceeding,\nreorganization or restructuring of an issuer\nwould not be component securities of an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s underlying index, which\ncould subject an Underlying Fund to additional\ntracking error risk. To the extent that the\nUnderlying Funds receives other assets in\nconnection with a bankruptcy proceeding,\nreorganization or financial restructuring, the\nUnderlying Funds may also be subject to\nadditional risks associated with the assets\nreceived. One example of assets that the\nUnderlying Funds could receive is an interest\nin one or more loans made to the issuer as\npart of a workout agreed to by a consortium of\nlienholders and creditors of the issuer. The\nUnderlying Funds may receive such interests in\nloans to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.\nSecurities or other assets received in a\nreorganization or restructuring typically\nentail a higher degree of risk than\ninvestments in securities of issuers that have\nnot undergone a reorganization or\nrestructuring and may be subject to heavy\nselling or downward pricing pressure after\ncompletion of the reorganization or\nrestructuring. The post-\nreorganization/restructuring assets and\nsecurities may also be illiquid and difficult\nto sell or value. If the Underlying Funds\nparticipates in negotiations with respect to a\nplan of reorganization or restructuring with\nrespect to securities of the issuer held by\nthe Underlying Funds, the Fund or Underlying\nFunds also may be restricted from disposing\nsuch securities for a period of time. If the\nUnderlying Funds become involved in such\nproceedings, the Underlying Funds may have\nmore active participation in the affairs of\nthe issuer than that assumed generally by an\ninvestor. Money Market Instruments Risk. The\nFund or an Underlying Fund may hold money\nmarket instruments. The value of money market\ninstruments may be affected by changes in\ninterest rates or in the credit ratings of the\ninvestments, among other things. If a\nsignificant amount of the Fund's assets is\ninvested in money market instruments, it may\nbe more difficult for the Fund to achieve its\ninvestment objective. An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. It is possible to\nlose money by investing in a money market\nfund. Money market funds other than U.S.\ngovernment money market funds and retail money\nmarket funds \u201c float \u201d their NAV instead of\nusing a stable $1.00 per share price. National\nClosed Market Trading Risk. To the extent that\nthe underlying securities held by the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges\nor in foreign markets that are closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's shares trade is open, there\nare likely to be deviations between the\ncurrent price of such an underlying security\nand the last quoted price for the underlying\nsecurity ( i.e. , the Fund\u2019s quote from the\nclosed foreign market). The impact of a closed\nforeign market on the Fund is likely to be\ngreater where a large portion of the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying securities and/or other assets\ntrade on that closed foreign market or when\nthe foreign market is closed for unscheduled\nreasons. These deviations may result in\npremiums or discounts to the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than\nthose experienced by other ETFs. Non-U.S.\nSecurities. Certain obligations or securities\nof non-U.S. issuers may be deemed to be\nlocated in a particular country if: (i) the\nprincipal trading market for the security is\nin such country, (ii) the issuer is organized\nunder the laws of such country, (iii) the\nissuer derives at least 50% of its revenues or\nprofits from such country or has at least 50%\nof its assets situated in such country or,\n(iv) the issuer is the government of the\nparticular country. Operational Risk. BFA and\nthe Fund and certain Underlying Funds' other\nservice providers may experience disruptions\nor operating errors such as processing errors\nor human errors, inadequate or failed internal\nor external processes, or systems or\ntechnology failures, that could negatively\nimpact the Fund. While service providers are\nrequired to have appropriate operational risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, their\nmethods of operational risk management may\ndiffer from the Fund\u2019s in the setting of\npriorities, the personnel and resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. BFA, through its monitoring and\noversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid\n\n17\n\nand mitigate risks that could lead to\ndisruptions and operating errors. However, it\nis not possible for BFA or the other Fund\nservice providers to identify all of the\noperational risks that may affect the Fund or\nto develop processes and controls to\ncompletely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Quasi-Sovereign\nObligations Risk. The Fund and certain\nUnderlying Funds may invest in quasi-sovereign\ndebt obligations. An investment in quasi-\nsovereign debt obligations involves special\nrisks generally not present in corporate debt\nobligations. Quasi-sovereign debt includes\ninvestments in securities issued or guaranteed\nby an entity affiliated with or backed by a\nsovereign government. Generally, quasi-\nsovereign debt obligations are issued by\ncompanies in which a government owns a\nmajority of the issuer\u2019s voting shares. They\nare often considered strategically important\nto the sovereign entity but do not legally\ncarry sovereign status for purposes of debt\nrepayment. While certain quasi-sovereign debt\nissuers have received sovereign government\nsupport in the past, such past support is not\na guarantee that it will continue in the\nfuture. In fact, in the past certain quasi-\nsovereign debt issuers have pushed their\ncreditors toward debt restructuring, rather\nthan meeting their payment obligations. Quasi-\nsovereign debt obligations are typically less\nliquid and less standardized than sovereign\ndebt obligations. Real Estate Company Risk. An\nUnderlying Fund that invests in companies that\ninvest in real estate, such as real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ), real estate\nholding and operating companies or real estate\ndevelopment companies (collectively, \u201c Real\nEstate Companies \u201d ) is exposed to unique\nrisks that relate specifically to the way in\nwhich Real Estate Companies are organized and\noperated. Real estate is a cyclical business,\nhighly sensitive to general and local economic\nconditions and developments, and characterized\nby intense competition and periodic\noverbuilding. Interest Rate Risk. Rising\ninterest rates could result in higher costs of\ncapital for Real Estate Companies, which could\nnegatively impact a Real Estate Company\u2019s\nability to meet its payment obligations.\nLeverage Risk. Real Estate Companies may use\nleverage (and some may be highly leveraged),\nwhich increases investment risk and could\nadversely affect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\noperations and market value in periods of\nrising interest rates as well as risks\nnormally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other capital\nexpenditures, the income and ability of a Real\nEstate Company to make payments of any\ninterest and principal on its debt securities\nwill be adversely affected. Property Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may be subject to risks\nrelating to functional obsolescence or reduced\ndesirability of properties; extended vacancies\ndue to economic conditions and tenant\nbankruptcies; catastrophic events such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts;\nand casualty or condemnation losses. Real\nestate income and values also may be greatly\naffected by demographic trends, such as\npopulation shifts or changing tastes and\nvalues, or increasing vacancies or declining\nrents resulting from legal, cultural,\ntechnological, global or local economic\ndevelopments. Management Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies are dependent upon management skills\nand may have limited financial resources. Real\nEstate Companies are generally not diversified\nand may be subject to heavy cash flow\ndependency, default by borrowers and self-\nliquidation. In addition, transactions between\nReal Estate Companies and their affiliates may\nbe subject to conflicts of interest, which may\nadversely affect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\nshareholders. A Real Estate Company may also\nhave joint venture investments in certain of\nits properties and, consequently, its ability\nto control decisions relating to such\nproperties may be limited. Liquidity Risk.\nInvesting in Real Estate Companies may involve\nrisks similar to those associated with\ninvesting in small-capitalization companies.\nReal Estate Company securities, like the\nsecurities of other smaller companies, may be\nmore volatile than, and perform differently\nfrom, shares of large capitalization\ncompanies. There may be less trading in Real\nEstate Company shares, which means that buy\nand sell transactions in those shares could\nhave a magnified impact on share price,\nresulting in abrupt or erratic price\nfluctuations. In addition, real estate is\nrelatively illiquid and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nConcentration Risk. Real Estate Companies may\nlack diversification, due to ownership of a\nlimited number of properties and concentration\nin a particular geographic region or property\ntype.\n\n18\n\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nRegulatory Risk. Real estate income and values\nmay be adversely affected by such factors as\napplicable domestic and foreign laws\n(including tax laws). Government actions, such\nas tax increases, zoning law changes or\nenvironmental regulations, also may have a\nmajor impact on real estate income and values.\nReference Rate Replacement Risk. The Fund or\nan Underlying Fund may be exposed to financial\ninstruments that recently transitioned from,\nor continue to be tied to, the London\nInterbank Offered Rate ( \u201c LIBOR \u201d ) to\ndetermine payment obligations, financing\nterms, hedging strategies or investment value.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct\nAuthority ( \u201c FCA \u201d ), which regulates LIBOR,\nhas ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In\nApril 2023, however, the FCA announced that\nsome USD LIBOR settings will continue to be\npublished under a synthetic methodology until\nSeptember 30, 2024 for certain legacy\ncontracts. The Secured Overnight Financing\nRate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which is a broad measure of\nthe cost of borrowing cash overnight\ncollateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in\nthe repurchase agreement market, has been used\nincreasingly on a voluntary basis in new\ninstruments and transactions. Under U.S.\nregulations that implement a statutory\nfallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark\nrates based on SOFR have replaced LIBOR in\ndifferent categories of financial contracts.\nNeither the effect of the LIBOR transition\nprocess nor its ultimate success can yet be\nknown. While some existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate-setting methodology, there\nmay be significant uncertainty regarding the\neffectiveness of any such alternative\nmethodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all\nexisting LIBOR-based instruments may have\nalternative rate-setting provisions and there\nremains uncertainty regarding the willingness\nand ability of issuers to add alternative\nrate-setting provisions in certain existing\ninstruments. Parties to contracts, securities,\nor other instruments using LIBOR may disagree\non transition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may have instruments linked to\nother interbank offered rates that may also\ncease to be published in the future. Risk of\nInvesting in Mortgage Real Estate Investment\nTrusts. Mortgage REITs lend money to\ndevelopers and owners of properties and invest\nprimarily in mortgages and similar real estate\ninterests. The mortgage REITs receive interest\npayments from the owners of the mortgaged\nproperties. Accordingly, mortgage REITs are\nsubject to the credit risk of the borrowers to\nwhom they extend funds. Credit risk is the\nrisk that the borrower will not be able to\nmake timely interest and principal payments on\nthe loan to the REIT. Mortgage REITs also are\nsubject to the risk that the value of\nmortgaged properties may be less than the\namounts owed on the properties. If a mortgage\nREIT is required to foreclose on a borrower,\nthe amount recovered in connection with the\nforeclosure may be less than the amount owed\nto the mortgage REIT. Mortgage REITs are\nsubject to significant interest rate risk.\nDuring periods when interest rates are\ndeclining, mortgages are often refinanced or\nprepaid. Refinancing or prepayment of\nmortgages may reduce the yield of mortgage\nREITs. When interest rates decline, the value\nof a REIT\u2019s investment in fixed rate\nobligations can be expected to rise.\nConversely, when interest rates rise, the\nvalue of a REIT\u2019s investment in fixed rate\nobligations can be expected to decline. In\naddition, rising interest rates generally\nincrease the costs of obtaining financing,\nwhich could cause the value of a mortgage\nREIT\u2019s investments to decline. A REIT\u2019s\ninvestment in adjustable rate obligations may\nreact differently to interest rate changes\nthan an investment in fixed rate obligations.\nAs interest rates on adjustable rate mortgage\nloans are reset periodically, yields on a\nREIT\u2019s investment in such loans will gradually\nalign themselves to reflect changes in market\ninterest rates, causing the value of such\ninvestments to fluctuate less dramatically in\nresponse to interest rate fluctuations than\nwould investments in fixed rate obligations.\nMortgage REITs typically use leverage (and in\nmany cases, may be highly leveraged), which\nincreases investment risk and could adversely\naffect a REIT\u2019s operations and market value in\nperiods of rising interest rates, increased\ninterest rate volatility, downturns in the\neconomy and reductions in the availability of\nfinancing or deterioration in the conditions\nof the REIT\u2019s mortgage-related assets. Risk of\nInvesting in Non-U.S. Agency Debt Securities.\nUncollateralized bonds issued by agencies,\nsubdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign\ngovernments are generally backed only by the\ncreditworthiness and reputation of the\nentities issuing the bonds and may not be\nbacked by the full faith and credit of the\nforeign government. Moreover, a foreign\ngovernment that explicitly provides its full\nfaith and credit to a particular entity may\nbe, due to changed circumstances, unable or\nunwilling to actually provide that support. If\na non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its\nobligations, the performance of\n\n19\n\nthe Fund will be adversely impacted. A\nnon-U.S. agency\u2019s operations and financial\ncondition are influenced by the foreign\ngovernment\u2019s economic and other policies.\nChanges to the financial condition or credit\nrating of a foreign government may cause the\nvalue of debt issued by that particular\nforeign government\u2019s agencies, subdivisions or\ninstrumentalities to decline. During periods\nof economic uncertainty, the trading of\nnon-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while\nmarket prices may be more volatile than prices\nof U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks\nassociated with non-U.S. agency investing\ninclude differences in accounting, auditing\nand financial reporting standards, adverse\nchanges in investment or exchange control\nregulations, political instability, which\ncould affect U.S. investments in foreign\ncountries and cause restrictions on the flow\nof international capital. Tracking Error Risk.\nThe Fund or each of its Underlying Funds may\nbe subject to tracking error, which is the\ndivergence of a fund\u2019s performance from that\nof its underlying index. Tracking error may\noccur because of differences between the\nsecurities and other instruments held in a\nfund\u2019s portfolio and those included in the\nFund's Underlying Index or an Underlying\nFund's underlying index, pricing differences,\ntransaction costs incurred by the Fund or its\nUnderlying Funds, the Fund\u2019s or its Underlying\nFunds' holding of uninvested cash, differences\nin timing of the accrual of or the valuation\nof dividends or interest received by the Fund\nor distributions paid to the Fund\u2019s or an\nUnderlying Fund's shareholders, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions carried out\nto minimize the distribution of capital gains\nto shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the Underlying Index or an\nUnderlying Funds\u2019 underlying index or the\ncosts to the Fund or an Underlying Fund of\ncomplying with various new or existing\nregulatory requirements. This risk may be\nheightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result because a fund\nincurs fees and expenses, while such a fund's\nunderlying index does not. When an issuer is\nintroduced by an index provider into an index\ntracked by a Fund or its Underlying Funds, BFA\nmay conduct an analysis on such issuer\u2019s\nsecurities to identify and screen for outlier\nhigh risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual\nprice growth that does not appear to be\nsupported by publicly available information on\nthe business and assets of the issuer, unusual\nor significant short interest or lending\nactivity, negative sentiment, suspended\ntrading or incorrect free-float calculations,\nwhich could be indicators of possible\nirregularities, miscalculations or even\nfraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA\nmay, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the\nrebalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from a\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's portfolio and,\nif it does so, such a fund will be subject to\nincreased tracking error due to the divergence\nin the securities included in its portfolio\nfrom its underlying index. BFA\u2019s\nunderweighting or excluding such securities\nmay result in a decline in the Fund\u2019s net\nasset value. The application of the\nabovementioned analysis and screening to a\nFund or an Underlying Fund and its Underlying\nIndex is in the sole discretion of BFA and its\naffiliates (without any guarantees). The\nanalysis and screening may not exclude any or\nall high risk securities from an Underlying\nIndex or a Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\nportfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\nthe Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more such\nsecurities declines in value. U.S. Agency\nMortgage-Backed Securities Risk. Securities\nbacked by pools of mortgages issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government or one of\nits agencies or sponsored entities, including\nGovernment National Mortgage Association ( \u201c\nGinnie Mae \u201d ), Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d ), and the\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( \u201c\nFreddie Mac \u201d ). The market for mortgage-\nbacked securities ( \u201c MBS \u201d ) has been\nadversely affected by the value of those MBS\nheld and/or issued by these agencies and\nsponsored entities. If a U.S. government\nagency or sponsored entity issues securities\nin which the Funds invest and such issuer is\nunable to meet its obligations or ceases to\nexist, and no plan is made for the repayment\nof securities, the performance of the Funds\nwill be adversely impacted. Ginnie Mae .\nEstablished in 1968, Ginnie Mae is a wholly\nowned U.S. government corporation within the\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment. Ginnie Mae is authorized to\nguarantee, with the backing of the full faith\nand credit of the U.S. government, the timely\npayment of principal and interest on\nsecurities issued by the institutions approved\nby Ginnie Mae (such as savings and loan\ninstitutions, commercial banks and mortgage\nbanks), and backed by pools of mortgages\ninsured by the Federal Housing Administration\nor guaranteed by the U.S. Department of\nVeterans Affairs. Ginnie Mae securities also\nare supported by the authority of Ginnie Mae\nto borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment to make payments under its\nguarantee. Any actual or potential disruption\nto Ginnie Mae, or the financial condition or\ncredit of the U.S. government, could cause the\nvalue of Ginnie Mae securities to decline. In\n2011, S&P Global Ratings downgraded U.S.\nTreasury securities from AAA rating to AA+\nrating. A further downgrade of the ratings of\nU.S. government debt obligations, which are\noften used as a benchmark for other borrowing\narrangements, could result in higher interest\nrates for individual and corporate borrowers,\ncause disruptions in the international bond\nmarkets and have a substantial negative effect\non the U.S. economy. A\n\n20\n\ndowngrade of U.S. Treasury securities from\nanother ratings agency or a further downgrade\nbelow AA+ rating by S&P Global Ratings may\ncause the value of Ginnie Mae securities to\ndecline. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . Fannie\nMae was established as a federal agency in\n1938 and in 1968 was chartered by Congress as\na private shareholder-owned company.\nSecurities issued by Fannie Mae are guaranteed\nas to timely payment of principal and interest\nby Fannie Mae. The securities are not backed\nby or entitled to the full faith and credit of\nthe U.S. government, but are supported by the\nright of Fannie Mae to borrow from the U.S.\nTreasury Department. Freddie Mac is a\nstockholder-owned corporation chartered by\nCongress in 1970. Securities issued by Freddie\nMac entitle the holder to timely payment of\ninterests, which is guaranteed by Freddie Mac.\nFreddie Mac also guarantees either ultimate\ncollection or timely payment of all principal\npayments. While Freddie Mac generally does not\nguarantee timely payment of principal, Freddie\nMac may remit the amount due on account of its\nguarantee of ultimate payment of principal at\nany time after default on an underlying\nmortgage, but in no event later than one year\nafter it becomes payable. The securities are\nnot backed by or entitled to the full faith\nand credit of the U.S. government or by any\nFederal Home Loan Banks, but are supported by\nthe right of Freddie Mac to borrow from the\nU.S. Treasury Department. In 2008, the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency placed each of Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac into government\nconservatorship in an effort to provide\nstability in the financial markets and put the\ngovernment-sponsored entities in sound and\nsolvent condition. In addition, the U.S.\nTreasury Department agreed to provide Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac up to $100 billion of\ncapital each on an as needed basis to ensure\nthat they continue to provide liquidity to the\nhousing and mortgage markets. Mortgage-Backed\nSecurities . MBS issued or guaranteed by the\nU.S. government or one of its agencies or\nsponsored entities, such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie\nMae, or Freddie Mac, represent interests in\npools of mortgages in which payments of both\nprincipal and interest on the securities are\ngenerally made monthly, in effect \u201c passing\nthrough \u201d the payments made by borrowers on\nthe mortgage loans that underlie the\nsecurities (net of any fees paid to the issuer\nor guarantor of the securities). MBS differ\nfrom other forms of debt securities, which\nnormally provide for periodic payment of\ninterest in fixed amounts with principal\npayments at maturity or specified call dates,\nwhile a MBS payments provide a combination of\ninterest and principal throughout the a bond\u2019s\nterm. As further described below, MBS may be\nstructured as pass-through securities or\ncollateralized mortgage obligations ( \u201c CMOs \u201d\n). MBS are subject to the general risks\nassociated with investing in real estate\nsecurities; that is, they may lose value if\nthe value of the underlying real estate to\nwhich a pool of mortgages relates declines. In\naddition, investments in MBS involve certain\nspecific risks. These risks include the\nfailure of a party to meet its commitments\nunder the related operative documents, adverse\ninterest rate changes and the effects of\nprepayments on mortgage cash flows. The value\nof MBS, like that of traditional fixed-income\nsecurities, typically increases when interest\nrates fall and decreases when interest rates\nrise. However, MBS differ from traditional\nfixed-income securities because of their\npotential for prepayment without penalty. The\nprice paid by the Fund for its MBS, the yield\nthe Fund expects to receive from such\nsecurities and the weighted average life of\nthe securities are based on a number of\nfactors, including the anticipated rate of\nprepayment of the underlying mortgages. In a\nperiod of declining interest rates, borrowers\nmay prepay the underlying mortgages more\nquickly than anticipated, thereby reducing the\nyield to maturity and the average life of the\nMBS. Moreover, when the Fund reinvests the\nproceeds of a prepayment in these\ncircumstances, it will likely receive a rate\nof interest that is lower than the rate on the\nsecurity that was prepaid. To the extent that\nthe Fund purchases MBS at a premium, mortgage\nforeclosures and principal prepayments may\nresult in a loss to the extent of the premium\npaid. If the Fund buys such securities at a\ndiscount, both scheduled payments of principal\nand unscheduled prepayments will increase\ncurrent and total returns and will accelerate\nthe recognition of income, which, when\ndistributed to shareholders, will be taxable\nas ordinary income. In a period of rising\ninterest rates, prepayments of the underlying\nmortgages may occur at a slower than expected\nrate, creating maturity extension risk. This\nparticular risk may effectively change a\nsecurity that was considered short- or\nintermediate-term at the time of purchase into\na long-term security. Since the value of long-\nterm securities generally fluctuates more\nwidely in response to changes in interest\nrates than that of shorter-term securities,\nmaturity extension risk could increase the\ninherent volatility of the Fund. Under certain\ninterest rate and prepayment scenarios, the\nFund may fail to recoup fully its investment\nin MBS notwithstanding any direct or indirect\nU.S. governmental or agency guarantee.\nMortgage Pass-Through Securities . Some MBS,\nsuch as U.S. agency mortgage pass-through\nsecurities, represent a right to receive\nprincipal and interest payments collected on a\npool of mortgages, which are passed through to\nsecurity holders. In the basic mortgage pass-\nthrough structure, mortgages with similar\nissuer, term and coupon characteristics are\ncollected and\n\n21\n\naggregated into a \u201c pool \u201d consisting of\nmultiple mortgage loans. The pool is assigned\na CUSIP number and undivided interests in the\npool are traded and sold as pass-through\nsecurities. The holder of the security is\nentitled to a pro rata share of principal and\ninterest payments (including unscheduled\nprepayments) from the pool of mortgage loans.\nAn investment in a specific pool of mortgage\npass-through securities requires an analysis\nof the specific prepayment risk of mortgages\nwithin the covered pool (since mortgagors\ntypically have the option to prepay their\nloans). The level of prepayments on a pool of\nMBS is difficult to predict and can impact the\nsubsequent cash flows, value and yield of the\nmortgage pool. In addition, when trading\nspecific mortgage pools, precise execution,\ndelivery and settlement arrangements must be\nnegotiated for each transaction. To-Be-\nAnnounced Securities . The Fund may seek to\ngain exposure to U.S. agency mortgage pass-\nthrough securities by investing in TBA\nsecurities. \u201c TBAs \u201d refer to a commonly used\nmechanism for the forward settlement of U.S.\nagency MBS, and not to a separate type of MBS.\nMost transactions in fixed-rate MBS occur\nthrough the use of TBA transactions. TBA\ntransactions generally are conducted in\naccordance with widely-accepted guidelines\nwhich establish commonly observed terms and\nconditions for execution, settlement, and\ndelivery. In a TBA transaction, the buyer and\nseller decide on general trade parameters,\nsuch as the issuing agency, settlement date,\npar amount, and price. The actual mortgage\npools delivered generally are determined two\ndays prior to settlement date. The Fund may\nregularly enter into TBA agreements and \u201c roll\nover \u201d such agreements prior to the settlement\ndate stipulated in such agreements. This type\nof TBA transaction is sometimes known as a \u201c\nTBA roll. \u201d In a TBA roll, the Fund generally\nwill sell the obligation to purchase the pools\nstipulated in the TBA agreement prior to the\nstipulated settlement date and will enter into\na new TBA agreement for future delivery of\npools of MBS. In addition, the Fund may enter\ninto TBA agreements and settle such\ntransactions on the stipulated settlement date\nby accepting actual receipt or delivery of the\npools of MBS stipulated in the TBA agreement.\nCertain of the Funds and Underlying Funds\nintend to invest cash pending settlement of\nTBA transactions in money market instruments,\nrepurchase agreements, or other high quality,\nliquid short-term instruments, including money\nmarket funds advised by BFA. Certain of the\nFunds and Underlying Funds will pay their pro\nrata share of fees and expenses of any money\nmarket fund that it may invest in, in addition\nto the Funds and Underlying Fund\u2019s own fees\nand expenses. Collateralized Mortgage\nObligations . U.S. agency MBS may also be\nstructured in the form of CMOs. CMOs are\ncreated by dividing the principal and interest\npayments collected on a pool of mortgages into\nseveral revenue streams ( \u201c tranches \u201d ) with\ndifferent priority rights to portions of the\nunderlying mortgage payments. Certain CMO\ntranches may represent a right to receive\ninterest only, principal only, or an amount\nthat remains after floating-rate tranches are\npaid (an \u201c inverse floater \u201d ). These\nsecurities are frequently referred to as \u201c\nmortgage derivatives \u201d and may be extremely\nsensitive to changes in interest rates.\nInterest rates on inverse floaters, for\nexample, vary inversely with a short-term\nfloating rate (which may be reset\nperiodically). Interest rates on inverse\nfloaters will decrease when short-term rates\nincrease and will increase when short-term\nrates decrease. These securities have the\neffect of providing a degree of investment\nleverage. In response to changes in market\ninterest rates or other market conditions, the\nvalue of an inverse floater may increase or\ndecrease at a multiple of the increase or\ndecrease in the value of the underlying\nsecurities. If the Fund invests in CMO\ntranches issued by U.S. government agencies or\nsponsored entities and interest rates move in\na manner not anticipated by BFA, it is\npossible that such a Fund could lose all or\nsubstantially all of its investment. Certain\nCMOs in which the Funds may invest may also\nprovide a degree of investment leverage, which\ncould cause such a Fund to lose all or\nsubstantially all of its investment. U.S.\nTreasury Obligations Risk. U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other securities\nin their interest rates, maturities, times of\nissuance and other characteristics. Similar to\nother issuers, changes to the financial\ncondition or credit rating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause the value of the Fund's\nU.S. Treasury obligations to decline. U.S.\nTreasury securities are rated AA+ by S&P\nGlobal Ratings. A downgrade of the rating of\nU.S. Treasury securities may cause the value\nof the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to\ndecline. Because U.S. government debt\nobligations are often used as a benchmark for\nother borrowing arrangements, a downgrade\ncould also result in higher interest rates for\na range of borrowers, cause disruptions in the\ninternational bond markets and have a\nsubstantial adverse effect on the U.S. and\nglobal economy. A high national debt level may\nincrease market pressures to meet government\nfunding needs, which may drive debt cost\nhigher and lead the government to issue\nadditional debt, thereby increasing\nrefinancing risk. A high national debt also\nraises concerns that the U.S. government will\nnot be able to make principal or interest\npayments when they are due. If market\nparticipants determine that U.S. sovereign\ndebt levels have become unsustainable, the\nvalue of the U.S. dollar could decline, thus\nincreasing inflationary pressures,\nparticularly with respect to services\noutsourced to non-U.S. providers and imported\ngoods and constrain or prevent the U.S.\ngovernment from implementing effective\ncountercyclical fiscal policy in economic\n\n22\n\ndownturns. Direct obligations of the U.S.\nTreasury have historically involved little\nrisk of loss of principal if held to maturity.\nHowever, due to fluctuations in interest\nrates, the market value of such securities may\nvary during the period that shareholders own\nshares of the Fund. Notwithstanding that U.S.\nTreasury obligations are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S., circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent the timely\npayment of interest or principal, such as\nreaching the legislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in losses to the\nFund and substantial negative consequences for\nthe U.S. economy and the global financial\nsystem. Risk of Derivatives. A derivative is a\nfinancial contract, the value of which depends\non, or is derived from, the value of an\nunderlying asset, such as a security, a\ncommodity (such as gold or silver), a currency\nor an index (a measure of value or rates, such\nas the S&P 500 or the prime lending rate).\nCompared to securities, derivatives can be\nmore sensitive to changes in interest rates or\nto sudden fluctuations in market prices and\nthus the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's losses\nmay be greater if they invest in derivatives\nthan if they invest only in conventional\nsecurities. Derivatives are also subject to\ncounterparty risk, which is the risk that the\nother party in the transaction will not\nfulfill its contractual obligations.\nDerivatives generally involve the incurrence\nof leverage. When a derivative is used as a\nhedge against a position that the Fund holds\nor is committed to purchase, any loss\ngenerated by the derivative generally should\nbe substantially offset by gains on the hedged\ninvestment, and vice versa. While hedging can\nreduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce\nor eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging\ncan cause losses that are not offset by gains,\nand the Fund will recognize losses on both the\ninvestment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes\nsubject to imperfect matching between the\nderivative and the underlying security, and\nthere can be no assurance that the Fund\u2019s\nhedging transactions, which entail additional\ntransaction costs, will be effective. Risk of\nFutures and Options on Futures Transactions.\nThere are several risks accompanying the\nutilization of futures contracts and options\non futures contracts. A position in futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts may\nbe closed only on the exchange on which the\ncontract was made (or a linked exchange).\nWhile the Fund and each Underlying Fund plans\nto utilize futures contracts only if an active\nmarket exists for such contracts, there is no\nguarantee that a liquid market will exist for\nthe contract at a specified time. Furthermore,\nbecause, by definition, futures contracts\nproject price levels in the future and not\ncurrent levels of valuation, market\ncircumstances may result in a discrepancy\nbetween the price of the bond index future and\nthe movement in the relevant underlying\nindexes. In the event of adverse price\nmovements, the Fund and an Underlying Fund\nwould continue to be required to make daily\ncash payments to maintain its required margin.\nIn such situations, if the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund has insufficient cash, it may\nhave to sell portfolio securities to meet\ndaily margin requirements at a time when it\nmay be disadvantageous to do so. In addition,\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund may be required\nto deliver the instruments underlying the\nfutures contracts it has sold. The risk of\nloss in trading futures contracts or uncovered\ncall options in some strategies ( e.g. ,\nselling uncovered bond index futures\ncontracts) is potentially unlimited. The Fund\nand each Underlying Fund does not plan to use\nfutures and options contracts in this way. The\nrisk of a futures position may still be large\nas traditionally measured due to the low\nmargin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund and each Underlying Fund,\nhowever, intends to utilize futures and\noptions contracts in a manner designed to\nlimit its risk exposure to levels comparable\nto a direct investment in the types of bonds\nin which it invests. Utilization of futures\nand options on futures by the Fund and an\nUnderlying Fund involves the risk of imperfect\nor even negative correlation to its underlying\nindex if the index underlying the futures\ncontract differs from the underlying index.\nThere is also the risk of loss by an\nUnderlying Fund of margin deposits in the\nevent of bankruptcy of a broker with whom the\nUnderlying Fund has an open position in the\nfutures contract or option. The purchase of\nput or call options will be based upon\npredictions by BFA as to anticipated trends,\nwhich predictions could prove to be incorrect.\nBecause the futures market generally imposes\nless burdensome margin requirements than the\nsecurities market, an increased amount of\nparticipation by speculators in the futures\nmarket could result in price fluctuations.\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day.\nThe daily limit establishes the maximum amount\nby which the price of a futures contract may\nvary either up or down from the previous day's\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of\n\n23\n\nfutures positions and subjecting the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, an\nUnderlying Fund would be required to make\ndaily cash payments of variation margin. Risk\nof Investing in Non-U.S. Debt Securities.\nNon-U.S. debt securities are traded on foreign\nexchanges and OTC in the respective countries\ncovered by the Fund or an Underlying Fund. The\nrisks of investing in non-U.S. debt securities\ntypically include market fluctuations caused\nby such factors as economic and political\ndevelopments, changes in interest rates and\nperceived trends in bond prices. Investing in\na fund whose portfolio contains securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers involves certain risks and\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the securities of U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include securities markets that\nmay lack sufficient liquidity or may be less\nefficient; generally greater price volatility;\nless publicly available information about\nissuers; the imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; the imposition of restrictions on\nthe expatriation of funds or other assets of\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund; higher\ntransaction and custody costs; delays and\nrisks attendant in settlement procedures;\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual\nobligations; lower liquidity and significantly\nsmaller market capitalization of most non-U.S.\nsecurities markets; different accounting and\ndisclosure standards; lower levels of\nregulation of the securities markets; more\nsubstantial government interference with the\neconomy; higher rates of inflation; greater\nsocial, economic, and political uncertainty;\nthe risk of nationalization or expropriation\nof assets; and different bankruptcy and\ninsolvency regimes which may stay or prevent\nrecovery in the event of an issuer\u2019s default.\nRisk of Investing in Asia. Investments in\nsecurities of issuers in certain Asian\ncountries involve risks not typically\nassociated with investments in securities of\nissuers in other regions. Such heightened\nrisks include, among others, expropriation\nand/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, piracy of intellectual property,\ndata and other security breaches (especially\nof data stored electronically), political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict and social instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-\neconomic unrest. Certain Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid rates of economic growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, and there\nis no assurance that these rates of economic\ngrowth and industrialization will be\nmaintained. Certain Asian countries have\ndemocracies with relatively short histories,\nwhich may increase the risk of political\ninstability. These countries have faced\npolitical and military unrest, and further\nunrest could present a risk to their local\neconomies and securities markets. Indonesia\nand the Philippines have each experienced\nviolence and terrorism, which has negatively\nimpacted their economies. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect Asian issuers that\nrely on the U.S. for trade. Political,\nreligious, and border disputes persist in\nIndia. India has recently experienced and may\ncontinue to experience civil unrest and\nhostilities with certain of its neighboring\ncountries. Increased political and social\nunrest in these geographic areas could\nadversely affect the performance of\ninvestments in this region. Certain\ngovernments in this region administer prices\non several basic goods, including fuel and\nelectricity, within their respective\ncountries. Certain governments may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector in their respective countries\nand may own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in this\nregion, which in turn could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments adversely affecting investments\nin the region. Corruption and the perceived\nlack of a rule of law in dealings with\ninternational companies in certain Asian\ncountries may discourage foreign investment\nand could negatively impact the long-term\ngrowth of certain economies in this region. In\naddition, certain countries in the region are\nexperiencing high unemployment and corruption,\nand have fragile banking sectors. Some\neconomies in this region are dependent on a\nrange of commodities, including oil, natural\ngas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly\naffected by international commodity prices and\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. The market\nfor securities in this region may also be\ndirectly influenced by the flow of\ninternational capital, and by the economic and\nmarket conditions of neighboring countries.\nChina is a key trading partner of many Asian\ncountries and any changes in trading\nrelationships between China and other Asian\ncountries may affect the region as a whole.\nAdverse economic conditions or developments in\nneighboring countries may increase investors'\nperception of the risk of investing in the\nregion as a whole, which may adversely impact\nthe market value of the securities issued by\ncompanies in the region.\n\n24\n\nRisk of Investing in Australasia. The\neconomies of Australasia, which include\nAustralia and New Zealand, are dependent on\nexports from the agricultural and mining\nsectors. This makes Australasian economies\nsusceptible to fluctuations in the commodity\nmarkets. Australasian economies are also\nincreasingly dependent on their growing\nservice and tourism industries. Australia and\nNew Zealand are located in a part of the world\nthat has historically been prone to natural\ndisasters, such as drought and flooding. Any\nsuch event in the future could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the economies of\nAustralia and New Zealand and affect the value\nof securities held by the relevant Underlying\nFund. The economies of Australia and New\nZealand are dependent on trading with certain\nkey trading partners, including Asia and the\nU.S. The economies of Australia and New\nZealand are heavily dependent on the mining\nsector. Passage of new regulations limiting\nforeign ownership of companies in the mining\nsector or imposition of new taxes on profits\nof mining companies may dissuade foreign\ninvestment, and as a result, have a negative\nimpact on companies to which an Underlying\nFund has exposure. Risk of Investing in\nBrazil. Investment in securities of companies\ndomiciled in Brazil involves a high degree of\nrisk and special considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in the U.S.\nsecurities markets. Such heightened risks\ninclude, among others, a high level of price\nvolatility in the Brazilian equity and\ncurrency markets, political unrest, chronic\nstructural public sector deficits, a rising\nunemployment rate and disparities of wealth.\nBrazil has historically experienced high rates\nof inflation and may continue to do so in the\nfuture. An increase in prices for commodities,\nthe depreciation of the Brazilian currency\n(the real) and potential future governmental\nmeasures seeking to maintain the value of the\nreal in relation to the U.S. dollar, may\ntrigger increases in inflation in Brazil and\nmay slow the rate of growth of the Brazilian\neconomy. Inflationary pressures also may limit\nthe ability of certain Brazilian issuers to\naccess foreign financial markets and may lead\nto further government intervention in the\neconomy, including the introduction of\ngovernment policies that may adversely affect\nthe overall performance of the Brazilian\neconomy, which in turn could adversely affect\nthe Fund's investments. The Brazilian\ngovernment has exercised, and continues to\nexercise, significant influence over the\nBrazilian economy, which may have significant\neffects on Brazilian companies and on market\nconditions and prices of Brazilian securities.\nThe Brazilian economy has been characterized\nby frequent, and occasionally drastic,\nintervention by the Brazilian government. The\nBrazilian government has often changed\nmonetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other\npolicies to influence the core of Brazil\u2019s\neconomy. The Brazilian government\u2019s actions to\ncontrol inflation and affect other economic\npolicies have involved, among others, the\nsetting of wage and price controls, blocking\naccess to bank accounts, fluctuation of the\nbase interest rates, imposing exchange\ncontrols and limiting imports into Brazil. In\nthe past, the Brazilian government has\nmaintained domestic price controls, and no\nassurances can be given that price controls\nwill not be re-imposed in the future.\nInvestments in Brazilian securities may be\nsubject to certain restrictions on foreign\ninvestment. Brazilian law provides that\nwhenever a serious imbalance in Brazil\u2019s\nbalance of payments exists or is anticipated,\nthe Brazilian government may impose temporary\nrestrictions on the remittance to foreign\ninvestors of the proceeds of their investment\nin Brazil and on the conversion of Brazilian\ncurrency into foreign currency. The likelihood\nof such restrictions may be affected by the\nextent of Brazil\u2019s foreign currency reserves,\nthe size of Brazil\u2019s debt service burden\nrelative to the economy as a whole, and\npolitical constraints to which Brazil may be\nsubject. There can be no assurance that the\nBrazilian government will not impose\nrestrictions or restrictive exchange control\npolicies in the future, which could have the\neffect of preventing or restricting access to\nforeign currency. The market for Brazilian\nsecurities is directly influenced by the flow\nof international capital, and economic and\nmarket conditions of certain countries,\nespecially other emerging market countries in\nCentral and South America. Adverse economic\nconditions or developments in other emerging\nmarket countries have at times significantly\naffected the availability of credit in the\nBrazilian economy and resulted in considerable\noutflows of funds and declines in the amount\nof foreign currency invested in Brazil. Crises\nin neighboring emerging market countries also\nmay increase investors\u2019 risk aversion, which\nmay adversely impact the market value of the\nsecurities issued by Brazilian companies. Risk\nof Investing in Central and South America. The\neconomies of certain countries in which\ncertain of the Underlying Funds invest are\naffected by the economies of other Central and\nSouth American countries, some of which have\nexperienced high interest rates, economic\nvolatility, inflation, currency devaluations,\ngovernment defaults, regime changes, high\nunemployment rates and political instability\nwhich can adversely affect issuers in these\ncountries. In addition, commodities\n\n25\n\n(such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a\nsignificant percentage of the region's exports\nand many economies in this region are\nparticularly sensitive to fluctuations in\ncommodity prices. Adverse economic events in\none country may have a significant adverse\neffect on some or all of the the countries in\nwhich an Underlying Fund invests. The\ngovernments of certain countries in Central\nand South America may exercise substantial\ninfluence over many aspects of the private\nsector and may own or control many companies.\nFuture government actions could have a\nsignificant effect on the economic conditions\nin such countries, which could have a negative\nimpact on the securities in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests. Diplomatic\ndevelopments may also adversely affect\ninvestments in certain countries in Central\nand South America. Some countries in Central\nand South America may be affected by public\ncorruption and crime, including organized\ncrime. Certain countries in Central and South\nAmerica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. In addition, certain issuers\nlocated in countries in Central and South\nAmerica in which an Underlying Fund invests\nmay be the subject of sanctions (for example,\nthe U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain\nVenezuelan individuals, corporate entities and\nthe Venezuelan government) or have dealings\nwith countries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its\nreputation if it is identified as an issuer\nthat has dealings with such countries. The\nUnderlying Funds may be adversely affected if\nthey invest in such issuers. Risk of Investing\nin China. Investments in securities of\ncompanies domiciled in China involve a high\ndegree of risk and special considerations not\ntypically associated with investing in the\nU.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks\ninclude, among others, an authoritarian\ngovernment, popular unrest associated with\ndemands for improved political, economic and\nsocial conditions, the impact of regional\nconflict on the economy and hostile relations\nwith neighboring countries. Military\nconflicts, either in response to internal\nsocial unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries, could disrupt economic development.\nThe Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-\nrunning disagreements and religious and\nnationalist disputes with Tibet and the\nXinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been\ntensions between the Chinese government and\nmany people in Hong Kong who perceive China as\ntightening control over Hong Kong\u2019s semi-\nautonomous liberal political, economic, legal,\nand social framework. Recent protests and\nunrest have increased tensions even further.\nDue to the interconnected nature of the Hong\nKong and Chinese economies, this instability\nin Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong\nKong and Chinese markets. China has a complex\nterritorial dispute regarding the sovereignty\nof Taiwan and has made threats of invasion.\nTaiwan-based companies and individuals are\nsignificant investors in China. Military\nconflict between China and Taiwan may\nadversely affect securities of Chinese\nissuers. In addition, China has strained\ninternational relations with Japan, India,\nRussia and other neighbors due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities and other\ndefense concerns. Additionally, China is\nalleged to have participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Actual and\nthreatened responses to such activity and\nstrained international relations, including\npurchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests. China could be\naffected by military events on the Korean\npeninsula or internal instability within North\nKorea. These situations may cause uncertainty\nin the Chinese market and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the Chinese economy. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, the Chinese government still\nexercises substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Chinese companies,\nsuch as those in the financial services or\ntechnology sectors, and potentially other\nsectors in the future, are subject to the risk\nthat Chinese authorities can intervene in\ntheir operations and structure. The Chinese\ngovernment continues to maintain a major role\nin economic policymaking, and investing in\nChina involves risk of loss due to\nexpropriation, nationalization, confiscation\nof assets and property or the imposition of\nrestrictions on foreign investments and on\nrepatriation of capital invested. An\nUnderlying Fund may invest in securities\nissued by variable interest entities ( \u201c VIEs\n\u201d ), which are subject to the investment risks\nassociated with the underlying Chinese\noperating company. A VIE enters into service\ncontracts and other contracts with the Chinese\noperating company, which provide the VIE with\nexposure to the company. Although the VIE has\nno equity ownership of the Chinese operating\ncompany, the contractual arrangements permit\nthe VIE to consolidate the Chinese\n\n26\n\noperating company into its financial\nstatements. Intervention by the Chinese\ngovernment with respect to VIEs could\nsignificantly affect the Chinese operating\ncompany\u2019s performance and the enforceability\nof the VIE\u2019s contractual arrangements with the\nChinese company. In addition, there is less\nregulation and monitoring of Chinese\nsecurities markets and the activities of\ninvestors, brokers and other participants than\nin the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities\nin China, including Chinese companies that are\nlisted on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to\nthe same degree of regulation as are U.S.\nissuers with respect to such matters as\ninsider trading rules, tender offer\nregulation, accounting standards or auditor\noversight, stockholder proxy requirements and\nthe requirements mandating timely and accurate\ndisclosure of information. Securities markets\nin China are in the process of change and\nfurther development. This may lead to trading\nvolatility, difficulty in the settlement and\nrecording of transactions and difficulty in\ninterpreting and applying the relevant\nregulation. There may be significant obstacles\nto obtaining information necessary for\ninvestigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund is not\nactively managed and does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. The Fund and the Underlying\nFunds may invest in H-shares (securities of\ncompanies incorporated in the People's\nRepublic of China ( \u201c PRC \u201d ) that are\ndenominated in Hong Kong dollars and listed on\nthe Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited). Each\nFund may also invest in certain Hong Kong\nlisted securities known as Red-Chips\n(securities issued by companies incorporated\nin certain foreign jurisdictions, which are\ncontrolled, directly or indirectly, by\nentities owned by the national government or\nlocal governments in the PRC and derive\nsubstantial revenues or allocate substantial\nassets in the PRC) and P-Chips (securities\nissued by companies incorporated in certain\nforeign jurisdictions, which are controlled,\ndirectly or indirectly, by individuals in the\nPRC and derive substantial revenues or\nallocate substantial assets in the PRC).\nP-Chips or Red-Chips of issuers that also\nissue A-Shares (securities of companies that\nare listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock\nexchanges that are mostly limited to domestic\ninvestors and denominated in renminbi) may\ntrade at significant discounts to their\nA-Shares counterparts. The issuance of\nH-shares by Chinese companies and the ability\nto obtain a \u201c back-door listing \u201d through Red-\nChips or P-Chips is still regarded by the\nChinese authorities as an experiment in\neconomic reform. \u201c Back-door listing \u201d is a\nmeans by which a mainland Chinese company\nissues Red-Chips or P-Chips to obtain quick\naccess to international listing and\ninternational capital. All of these share\nmechanisms are relatively untested and subject\nto political and economic policy in China.\nChinese securities have recently experienced\nsubstantial volatility, which is expected to\ncontinue in the future. While the Chinese\neconomy has experienced past periods of rapid\ngrowth, there is no assurance that such growth\nrates will recur. China may experience\nsubstantial rates of inflation, significant\nindebtedness or economic recessions, causing a\nnegative effect on the economy and securities\nmarket. China\u2019s economy is heavily dependent\non export growth. Reduction in spending on\nChinese products and services, supply chain\ndiversification, institution of additional\ntariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions between China and the U.S. or in\nresponse to actual or alleged Chinese cyber\nactivity) or a downturn in any of the\neconomies of China\u2019s key trading partners may\nhave an adverse impact on the Chinese economy\nand the companies in which a Fund invests.\nCertain Chinese companies (which may change\nfrom time to time) are directly or indirectly\nsubject to economic or trade restrictions\nimposed by the U.S. or other governments due\nto national security, human rights or other\nconcerns of such government. For example,\ncertain foreign technology companies are\nsubject to U.S. export controls as those\ncompanies are believed to pose a risk to U.S.\ninterests. The U.S. also bans imports of goods\nproduced in certain regions of China or by\ncertain Chinese companies due to concerns\nabout forced labor. Such restrictions may have\nunanticipated and adverse effects on the\nChinese economy and companies. Any action that\ntargets Chinese financial markets or\nsecurities exchanges could interfere with\norderly trading, delay settlement or cause\nmarket disruptions. The Underlying Index of a\nFund may include companies that are subject to\neconomic or trade restrictions (but not\ninvestment restrictions) imposed by the U.S.\nor other governments. So long as these\nrestrictions do not include restrictions on\ninvestments, the Fund is generally expected to\ninvest in such companies, consistent with its\nobjective to track the performance of its\nUnderlying Index. The tax laws and regulations\nin the People\u2019s Republic of China ( \u201c PRC \u201d )\nare subject to change, including the issuance\nof authoritative guidance or enforcement,\npossibly with retroactive effect. The\ninterpretation, applicability and enforcement\nof such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as\nconsistent and transparent as those of more\ndeveloped nations, and may vary over time and\nfrom region to region. The application and\nenforcement of PRC tax rules could have a\nsignificant adverse effect on a Fund and its\ninvestors, particularly in relation to capital\ngains withholding tax imposed upon non-\nresidents. In addition, the accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards and\npractices applicable to Chinese companies may\nbe less\n\n27\n\nrigorous, and may result in significant\ndifferences between financial statements\nprepared in accordance with the PRC accounting\nstandards and practice and those prepared in\naccordance with international accounting\nstandards. The Underlying Funds invest in the\nB-Shares market (securities of companies\nincorporated in the PRC and listed for foreign\ninvestment on stock exchanges in the PRC).\nSecurities listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen\nstock exchanges are divided into two classes:\nA-Shares, which are mostly limited to domestic\ninvestors and denominated in renminbi, and\nB-Shares, which are allocated for both\ninternational and domestic investors and\ndenominated in U.S. dollars on the Shanghai\nexchange and Hong Kong dollars on the Shenzhen\nexchange. The B-Shares market is generally\nsmaller, less liquid and has a smaller issuer\nbase than the A-Shares market, which may lead\nto significant price volatility. B-Shares,\nA-Shares, P-Chips or Red-Chips of issuers that\nalso issue A-Shares may trade at significant\ndiscounts to their A- Shares counterparts. The\nissuance of B-Shares and H-Shares by Chinese\ncompanies and the ability to obtain a \u201c back-\ndoor listing \u201d through Red-Chips or P-Chips is\nstill regarded by the Chinese authorities as\nan experiment in economic reform. \u201c Back-door\nlisting \u201d is a means by which mainland Chinese\ncompanies issues Red-Chips or P-Chips to\nobtain quick access to international listing\nand international capital. All of these share\nmechanisms are relatively untested and subject\nto political and economic policy in China.\nRisk of Investing in the China Bond Market.\nThe Underlying Funds invest in the domestic\nbond market in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n( \u201c China \u201d or the \u201c PRC \u201d ) (the \u201c China\nInterbank Bond Market \u201d ) through the\nnorthbound trading of Bond Connect. Bond\nConnect is an initiative launched in July 2017\nfor mutual bond market access between the PRC\nand Hong Kong, established by the China\nForeign Exchange Trade System & National\nInterbank Funding Centre ( \u201c CFETS \u201d ), China\nCentral Depository & Clearing Co., Ltd ( \u201c\nCCDC \u201d ), Shanghai Clearing House ( \u201c SCH \u201d ),\nHong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited ( \u201c\nHKEX \u201d ) and Central Moneymarkets Unit ( \u201c CMU\n\u201d ). The creation of Bond Connect allows\ninvestors to trade between the mainland China\nand Hong Kong markets electronically, which\neliminates the need for investor status and\nquotas that were required under previous\naccess models. Under the prevailing\nregulations in the PRC, eligible foreign\ninvestors are allowed to invest in the bonds\ncirculated in the China Interbank Bond Market\nthrough Bond Connect. Eligible foreign\ninvestors may submit trade requests for bonds\ncirculated in the China Interbank Bond Market\nthrough offshore electronic bond trading\nplatforms (such as Tradeweb), which will in\nturn transmit their requests for quotation to\nCFETS. CFETS will send the requests for\nquotation to a number of approved onshore\ndealers (including market makers and others\nengaged in the market making business) in the\nPRC. The approved onshore dealer(s) will\nrespond to the requests for quotation via\nCFETS and CFETS will send their responses to\nthose eligible foreign investors through the\nsame offshore electronic bond trading\nplatforms. Once the eligible foreign investor\naccepts the quotation, the trade is concluded\non CFETS. The settlement and custody of bonds\ntraded in the China Interbank Bond Market\nunder Bond Connect will be effected through\nthe settlement and custody link between CMU,\nas an offshore custody agent, and CCDC and\nSCH, as onshore custodians and clearing\ninstitutions in the PRC. Under the settlement\nlink, CCDC or SCH will effect gross settlement\nof confirmed trades onshore and CMU will\nprocess bond settlement instructions from CMU\nmembers on behalf of eligible foreign\ninvestors in accordance with its relevant\nrules. Since the introduction in August 2018\nof delivery versus payment (DVP) settlement in\nrespect of Bond Connect, the movement of cash\nand securities is carried out simultaneously\non a real-time basis. Pursuant to the\nprevailing regulations in the PRC, CMU, as the\noffshore custody agent recognized by the Hong\nKong Monetary Authority, will open omnibus\nnominee accounts with the onshore custody\nagent recognized by the People\u2019s Bank of China\n( i.e. , CCDC and SCH). All bonds traded by\neligible foreign investors through Bond\nConnect will be registered in the name of CMU,\nwhich will hold such bonds as a nominee owner.\nTherefore, a Fund will be exposed to custody\nrisks with respect to CMU. In addition, as the\nrelevant filings, registration with the\nPeople\u2019s Bank of China, and account opening\nhave to be carried out by third parties,\nincluding CMU, CCDC, SCH, and CFETS, a Fund is\nsubject to the risks of default or errors and\nomissions on the part of such third parties\nand may have limited remedies or no legal\nrecourse at all to cure such defaults, errors\nand omissions. The precise nature and rights\nof a Fund as the beneficial owner of the bonds\ntraded in the China Interbank Bond Market\nthrough CMU as nominee are relatively new and\nuntested areas of PRC law. The definition of,\nand distinction between, legal ownership and\nbeneficial ownership under PRC law differs\nfrom that in the U.S. and other developed\nmarket jurisdictions, there have been few\ncases involving a nominee account structure in\nthe PRC courts and, as a result, the rights of\nbeneficial owners are uncertain. The exact\nnature and methods of enforcement of the\nrights and interests of a Fund under PRC law\nare also uncertain. Market volatility and\npotential lack of liquidity due to low trading\nvolume of certain bonds in the China Interbank\nBond Market may result in prices of certain\nbonds to fluctuate significantly. A Fund\ninvesting in such market is therefore subject\nto liquidity and volatility risks. The bid-ask\nspreads of the prices of such securities may\nbe large, and a Fund may therefore incur\n\n28\n\nsignificant costs and may suffer losses when\nselling such investments. The bonds traded in\nthe China Interbank Bond Market may be\ndifficult or impossible to sell on a timely\nbasis or at all, which may impact a Fund\u2019s\nability to acquire or dispose of such\nsecurities at their expected prices. Investing\nin the China Interbank Bond Market through\nBond Connect is also subject to regulatory\nrisks. The relevant rules and regulations are\nsubject to change, which may have potential\nretrospective effect, and there can be no\nassurance that Bond Connect or certain\nfeatures or systems thereof will not be\nmaterially altered, suspended, discontinued or\nabolished. Furthermore, the securities\nregulation regimes and legal systems of the\nPRC and Hong Kong differ significantly and\nissues may arise based on these differences.\nIn the event that the relevant authorities\nsuspend account opening or trading on the\nChina Interbank Bond Market, a Fund\u2019s ability\nto invest in the China Interbank Bond Market\nwill be adversely affected, limited, or\ncurtailed altogether. In such event, a Fund\u2019s\nability to achieve its investment objective\nwill be negatively affected and, after\nexhausting other trading alternatives, the\nFund may suffer substantial losses as a\nresult. Further, if Bond Connect is not\noperating, a Fund may not be able to acquire\nor dispose of bonds through Bond Connect in a\ntimely manner, which could adversely affect\nthe Fund\u2019s performance. Trading through Bond\nConnect is performed through newly developed\ntrading platforms and operational systems.\nThere is no assurance that such systems will\nfunction as expected or will continue to be\nadapted to changes and developments in the\nmarket. In the event that a relevant system\ndoes not function as expected, trading through\nBond Connect may be disrupted. A Fund\u2019s\nability to trade through Bond Connect (and\nhence to pursue its investment strategy) may\ntherefore be adversely affected. In addition,\nwhere a Fund invests in the China Interbank\nBond Market through Bond Connect, it may be\nsubject to risks of delays inherent in the\norder placing and/or settlement systems. Bond\nConnect trades are settled in Chinese\ncurrency, the renminbi ( \u201c RMB \u201d ). This means\nthat the Fund will be exposed to currency\nrisk, and it cannot be guaranteed that\ninvestors will have timely access to a\nreliable supply of RMB. The RMB consists of an\nonshore RMB ( \u201c CNY \u201d ) and an offshore RMB (\n\u201c CNH \u201d ). The CNY is the official currency of\nthe PRC and is the currency of denomination\nfor all financial transactions between\nindividuals, the state and corporations in the\nPRC. Hong Kong is the first jurisdiction to\nallow for the accumulation of RMB deposits in\nthe form of CNH outside the PRC. Since 2010,\nthe CNH market is traded officially and\nregulated jointly by the Hong Kong Monetary\nAuthority and the PBOC. While CNY and CNH are\nthe same currency, they are traded in\ndifferent and separate markets. Therefore, CNY\nand CNH can be subject to different liquidity\nconstraints and market forces, meaning their\nvaluations can vary. The RMB-denominated bonds\nincluded in the applicable Underlying Index\nuse CNY as the base currency. As a result, to\nthe extent that the Fund holds RMB-denominated\ninstruments in CNH, it could be subject to\ntracking error and potential foreign exchange\ntransaction costs associated with converting\nfrom CNH to CNY (and vice versa). Under\nprevailing tax regulations, a 10% withholding\ntax is imposed on PRC-sourced dividends and\ninterest from non-government bonds paid to the\nrelevant Fund unless the rate is reduced under\nan applicable tax treaty. Value Added Tax\n(VAT) is levied on certain income derived by\nthe relevant Fund, including interest income\nfrom nongovernment bonds and trading gains,\nunless specifically exempted by the PRC tax\nauthorities. VAT exemptions currently apply to\ndebt securities traded in the China Interbank\nBond Market. On November 22, 2018, the PRC\u2019s\nMinistry of Finance and State Administration\nof Taxation jointly issued Circular 108\nproviding foreign institutional investors with\na temporary exemption from withholding income\ntax and VAT with respect to interest income\nderived from non-government bonds in the\ndomestic bond market for the period from\nNovember 7, 2018 to November 6, 2021. On\nNovember 26, 2021, the PRC's Ministry of\nFinance and State Administration of Taxation\njointly issued Circular 34 to extend the tax\nexemption period provided in Circular 108 to\nDecember 31, 2025. Circular 108 is silent on\nthe PRC tax treatment with respect to non-\ngovernment bond interest derived prior to\nNovember 7, 2018. There is a risk the PRC tax\nauthorities may withdraw the temporary tax\nexemptions in the future and seek to collect\nwithholding income tax and VAT on interest\nincome from non-government bonds to a Fund\nwithout prior notice. If the tax exemptions\nare withdrawn, any taxes arising from or to a\nFund may be directly borne by or indirectly\npassed on to the Fund, which may result in a\nsubstantial impact to its NAV. As with any NAV\nadjustment, investors may be advantaged or\ndisadvantaged depending on when the investors\npurchased or sold shares of the relevant Fund.\nAny changes in PRC tax law, future\nclarifications thereof, and/or subsequent\nretroactive enforcement by the PRC tax\nauthorities may result in a loss which could\nbe material to the relevant Fund. BFA will\nkeep the provisioning policy for tax liability\nunder review and may, in its discretion from\ntime to time, make a provision for potential\ntax liabilities if in its opinion such\nprovision is warranted or as further publicly\nclarified by the PRC.\n\n29\n\nRisk of Investing in Developed Countries. Many\ncountries with developed markets have recently\nexperienced significant economic pressures.\nThese countries generally tend to rely on the\nservices sectors ( e.g. , the financial\nservices sector) as the primary source of\neconomic growth and may be susceptible to the\nrisks of individual service sectors. For\nexample, companies in the financial services\nsector are subject to governmental regulation\nand, recently, government intervention, which\nmay adversely affect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and\namount of capital they must maintain.\nDislocations in the financial sector and\nperceived or actual governmental influence\nover certain financial companies may lead to\ncredit rating downgrades and, as a result,\nimpact, among other things, revenue growth for\nsuch companies. If financial companies\nexperience a prolonged decline in revenue\ngrowth, certain developed countries that rely\nheavily on financial companies as an economic\ndriver may experience a correlative slowdown.\nConcerns have emerged with respect to the\neconomic health of certain developed\ncountries. These concerns primarily stem from\nheavy indebtedness of many developed countries\nand their perceived inability to continue to\nservice high debt loads without simultaneously\nimplementing stringent austerity measures.\nSuch concerns have led to tremendous downward\npressure on the economies of these countries.\nAs a result, it is possible that interest\nrates on debt of certain developed countries\nmay rise to levels that make it difficult for\nsuch countries to service such debt. Spending\non health care and retirement pensions in most\ndeveloped countries has risen dramatically.\nMedical innovation, extended life expectancy\nand higher public expectations are likely to\ncontinue the increase in health care and\npension costs. Any increase in health care and\npension costs will likely have a negative\nimpact on the economic growth of many\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries rely on imports of certain key\nitems, such as crude oil, natural gas, and\nother commodities. As a result, an increase in\ndemand for, or price fluctuations of, certain\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Developed market countries\ngenerally are dependent on the economies of\ncertain key trading partners. Changes in any\none economy may cause an adverse impact on\nseveral developed countries. In addition,\nheavy regulation of, among others, labor and\nproduct markets may have an adverse effect on\ncertain issuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestments. Risk of Investing in Eastern\nEurope. Investing in the securities of issuers\nlocated or operating in Eastern Europe is\nhighly speculative and involves risks not\nusually associated with investing in the more\ndeveloped markets of Western Europe. Certain\nEastern European countries have high public\ndebt levels, significant underground\neconomies, high unemployment and emigration of\nskilled workers. Such countries generally have\na history of political instability, limited\ninfrastructure and an inefficient public\nsector prone to endemic corruption. Political\nand economic reforms are too recent to\nestablish a definite trend away from centrally\nplanned economies and state-owned industries.\nIn the past, some Eastern European governments\nhave expropriated substantial amounts of\nprivate property, and many claims of the\nproperty owners have never been fully settled.\nMany Eastern European countries continue to\nmove toward market economies at different\npaces with different characteristics. Many\nEastern European securities markets are\ngenerally underdeveloped with low, irregular\ntrading volumes, dubious investor protections,\nand often a dearth of reliable corporate\ninformation. Eastern European securities\nmarkets are generally subject to less\ngovernment supervision and regulation and may\nbe less liquid and more volatile than\nsecurities markets in the U.S. or Western\nEuropean countries. Legal institutions\ngoverning private and foreign investments and\nprivate property may be relatively nascent,\ninefficient, and unevenly enforced or\ninequitably enforced. Certain Eastern European\ngovernments may exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector and\nmay own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in such\ncountries, which could have a negative impact\non the Fund\u2019s investments. Information and\ntransaction costs, differential taxes, and\nsometimes political or transfer risk give a\ncomparative advantage to the domestic investor\nrather than the foreign investor. Eastern\nEuropean economies may also be particularly\nsusceptible to changes in the international\ncredit markets due to their reliance on bank\nrelated inflows of capital. Changes to the\neconomies of countries with substantial\nforeign direct investment in certain Eastern\nEuropean countries may negatively affect the\nregion\u2019s economy. The economy of certain\nEastern European countries may be adversely\naffected by global prices for manufactured\ngoods or commodity price declines to the\nextent that a country relies on the export of\nsuch products. Geopolitical events and other\ninstability in certain Eastern European\ncountries may cause uncertainty in the\nregion\u2019s financial markets and adversely\naffect the performance of the issuers to which\nthe Fund has exposure. These markets may be\nparticularly sensitive to social, political,\neconomic, and currency events in Russia and\nmay suffer heavy losses as a result of their\ntrading and investment links to the Russian\neconomy and currency. Russia has historically\nasserted its influence in the region using\ndiplomatic, informational, military, and\neconomic instruments of national power, as it\ndid with Georgia in the summer of 2008 and\nUkraine beginning in 2014, and most recently\non February 24, 2022.\n\n30\n\nRussian Invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally. Risk\nof Investing in Emerging Markets. Investments\nin emerging market countries may be subject to\ngreater risks than investments in developed\ncountries. These risks include: (i) less\nsocial, political, and economic stability;\n(ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility\ndue to smaller or limited local capital\nmarkets for such securities, or low or non-\nexistent trading volumes; (iii) companies,\ncustodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges\nand broker-dealers may be subject to less\nscrutiny and regulation by local authorities;\n(iv) local governments may decide to seize or\nconfiscate securities held by foreign\ninvestors and/or local governments may decide\nto suspend or limit an issuer's ability to\nmake dividend or interest payments; (v) local\ngovernments may limit or entirely restrict\nrepatriation of invested capital, profits, and\ndividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject\nto local taxation, including on a retroactive\nbasis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on\nstandard payments imposed by local governments\nmay attempt to make dividend or interest\npayments to foreign investors in the local\ncurrency; (viii) there may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and investors may experience\ndifficulty in enforcing legal claims related\nto the securities and/or local judges may\nfavor the interests of the issuer over those\nof foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments\nmay only be permitted to be paid in the local\ncurrency; (x) limited public information\nregarding the issuer may result in greater\ndifficulty in determining market valuations of\nthe securities; and (xi) lack of financial\nreporting on a regular basis, substandard\ndisclosure and differences in accounting\nstandards may make it difficult to ascertain\nthe financial health of an issuer. The Fund is\nnot actively managed and does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. Emerging market securities\nmarkets are typically marked by a high\nconcentration of market capitalization and\ntrading volume in a small number of issuers\nrepresenting a limited number of industries,\nas well as a high concentration of ownership\nof such securities by a limited number of\ninvestors. In addition, brokerage and other\ncosts associated with transactions in emerging\nmarket securities can be higher, sometimes\nsignificantly, than similar costs incurred in\nsecurities markets in developed countries.\nAlthough some emerging markets have become\nmore established and tend to issue securities\nof higher credit quality, the markets for\nsecurities in other emerging market countries\nare in the earliest stages of their\ndevelopment, and these countries issue\nsecurities across the credit spectrum. Even\nthe markets for relatively widely traded\nsecurities in emerging market countries may\nnot be able to absorb, without price\ndisruptions, a significant increase in trading\nvolume or trades of a size customarily\nundertaken by institutional investors in the\nsecurities markets of developed countries. The\nlimited size of many of these securities\nmarkets can cause prices to be erratic for\nreasons apart from factors that affect the\nsoundness and competitiveness of the\nsecurities issuers. For example, prices may be\nunduly influenced by traders who control large\npositions in these markets. Additionally,\nmarket making and arbitrage activities are\ngenerally less extensive in such markets,\nwhich may contribute to increased volatility\nand reduced liquidity of such markets. The\nlimited liquidity of emerging market country\nsecurities may also affect the Underlying\nFund's ability to accurately value its\nportfolio securities or to acquire or dispose\nof securities at the price and time it wishes\nto do so or in order to meet redemption\nrequests. Many emerging market countries\nsuffer from uncertainty and corruption in\ntheir legal frameworks. Legislation may be\ndifficult to interpret and laws may be too new\nto provide any precedential value. Laws\nregarding foreign investment and private\nproperty may be weak or non-existent. Sudden\nchanges in governments may result in policies\nwhich are less favorable to investors such as\npolicies designed to expropriate or\nnationalize \u201c sovereign \u201d assets. Certain\nemerging market countries in the past have\nexpropriated large amounts of private\nproperty, in many cases with little or no\ncompensation, and there can be no assurance\nthat such expropriation will not occur in the\nfuture. Investment in the securities markets\nof certain emerging market countries is\nrestricted or controlled to varying degrees.\nThese restrictions may limit an Underlying\nFund's investment in certain emerging market\ncountries and may increase the expenses of the\nUnderlying Fund. Certain emerging market\ncountries require governmental approval prior\nto investments by foreign persons or limit\ninvestment by foreign persons to only a\nspecified percentage of an issuer's\noutstanding securities or\n\n31\n\na specific class of securities which may have\nless advantageous terms (including price) than\nsecurities of the company available for\npurchase by nationals. Many emerging market\ncountries lack the social, political, and\neconomic stability characteristic of the U.S.\nPolitical instability among emerging market\ncountries can be common and may be caused by\nan uneven distribution of wealth, social\nunrest, labor strikes, civil wars, and\nreligious oppression. Economic instability in\nemerging market countries may take the form\nof: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels\nof inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii)\nhigh levels of unemployment or\nunderemployment; (iv) changes in government\neconomic and tax policies, including\nconfiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of\ntrade barriers. An Underlying Fund's income\nand, in some cases, capital gains from foreign\nsecurities will be subject to applicable\ntaxation in certain of the emerging market\ncountries in which it invests, and treaties\nbetween the U.S. and such countries may not be\navailable in some cases to reduce the\notherwise applicable tax rates. Emerging\nmarkets also have different clearance and\nsettlement procedures, and in certain of these\nemerging markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of securities transactions, making\nit difficult to conduct such transactions. In\nthe past, certain governments in emerging\nmarket countries have become overly reliant on\nthe international capital markets and other\nforms of foreign credit to finance large\npublic spending programs, which in the past\nhave caused huge budget deficits. Often,\ninterest payments have become too overwhelming\nfor a government to meet, representing a large\npercentage of total GDP. These foreign\nobligations have become the subject of\npolitical debate and served as fuel for\npolitical parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\nRisk of Investing in Europe. Investing in\nEuropean countries may expose the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund to the economic and political\nrisks associated with Europe in general and\nthe specific European countries in which it\ninvests. The economies and markets of European\ncountries are often closely connected and\ninterdependent, and events in one European\ncountry can have an adverse impact on other\nEuropean countries. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund may invest in securities of issuers that\nare domiciled in, have significant operations\nin, or that are listed on at least one\nsecurities exchange within member states of\nthe European Union (the \u201c EU \u201d ). A number of\ncountries within the EU are also members of\nthe Economic and Monetary Union (the \u201c\neurozone \u201d ) and have adopted the euro as\ntheir currency. Eurozone membership requires\nmember states to comply with restrictions on\ninflation rates, deficits, interest rates,\ndebt levels and fiscal and monetary controls,\neach of which may significantly affect every\ncountry in Europe. Changes in import or export\ntariffs, changes in governmental or EU\nregulations on trade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro and other currencies of\ncertain EU countries which are not in the\neurozone, the default or threat of default by\nan EU member state on its sovereign debt,\nand/or an economic recession in an EU member\nstate may have a significant adverse effect on\nthe economies of other EU member states and\ntheir trading partners. Although certain\nEuropean countries are not in the eurozone,\nmany of these countries are obliged to meet\nthe criteria for joining the eurozone.\nConsequently, these countries must comply with\nmany of the restrictions noted above. The\nEuropean financial markets have experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due to concerns\nabout economic downturns, government debt\nlevels and the possible default of government\ndebt in several European countries, including,\nbut not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus,\nFrance, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal,\nSpain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further\neconomic deterioration, certain countries,\nwithout prior warning, can institute \u201c capital\ncontrols. \u201d Countries may use these controls\nto restrict volatile movements of capital\nentering and exiting their country. Such\ncontrols may negatively affect an Underlying\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's investments. A\ndefault or debt restructuring by any European\ncountry would adversely impact holders of that\ncountry\u2019s debt and sellers of credit default\nswaps linked to that country\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, which may be located in\ncountries other than those listed above. In\naddition, the credit ratings of certain\nEuropean countries were downgraded in the\npast. These events have adversely affected the\nvalue and exchange rate of the euro and may\ncontinue to significantly affect the economies\nof every country in Europe, including\ncountries that do not use the euro and non-EU\nmember states. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central\nbanks and others, including austerity measures\nand\n\n32\n\nreforms, may not produce the desired results,\nmay result in social unrest and may limit\nfuture growth and economic recovery or have\nother unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The impact of these actions, especially if\nthey occur in a disorderly fashion, is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely impact the value\nof the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestments in the region. The United Kingdom\n(the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) left the EU ( \u201c Brexit \u201d ) on\nJanuary 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely\naffect European or worldwide political,\nregulatory, economic or market conditions and\ncould contribute to instability in global\npolitical institutions, regulatory agencies\nand financial markets. Certain European\ncountries have also developed increasingly\nstrained relationships with the U.S., and if\nthese relations were to worsen, they could\nadversely affect European issuers that rely on\nthe U.S. for trade. The national politics of\ncountries in Europe have been unpredictable\nand subject to influence by disruptive\npolitical groups and ideologies, including for\nexample, secessionist movements. The\ngovernments of European countries may be\nsubject to change and such countries may\nexperience social and political unrest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region also could impact financial\nmarkets. The impact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of the Fund's or an Underlying\nFund's investments. Russian Invasion of\nUkraine . Russia launched a large-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The\nextent and duration of the military action,\nresulting sanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions, including declines in its\nstock markets and the value of the ruble\nagainst the U.S. dollar, are impossible to\npredict, but could be significant. Disruptions\ncaused by Russian military action or other\nactions (including cyberattacks and espionage)\nor resulting actual and threatened responses\nto such activity, including purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts or changes in\nconsumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally. Risk\nof Investing in Japan. Japan may be subject to\npolitical, economic, labor and other risks.\nAny of these risks, individually or in the\naggregate, can impact an investment made in\nJapan. Currency Risk . The Japanese yen has\nfluctuated widely at times and any increase in\nits value may cause a decline in exports that\ncould weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has,\nin the past, intervened in the currency\nmarkets to attempt to maintain or reduce the\nvalue of the yen. Japanese intervention in the\ncurrency markets could cause the value of the\nyen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and\ncould cause losses to investors. Economic Risk\n. The growth of Japan\u2019s economy has recently\nlagged that of its Asian neighbors and other\nmajor developed economies. Since 2000, Japan\u2019s\neconomic growth rate has generally remained\nlow relative to other advanced economies, and\nit may remain low in the future. The Japanese\neconomy is heavily dependent on international\ntrade and has been adversely affected by trade\ntariffs, other protectionist measures,\ncompetition from emerging economies and the\neconomic conditions of its trading partners.\nJapan is also heavily dependent on oil\nimports, and higher commodity prices could\ntherefore have a negative impact on the\nJapanese economy. Geographic Risk . Natural\ndisasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic\neruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur\nin Japan or surrounding areas and could\nnegatively affect the Japanese economy, and,\nin turn, could negatively affect the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund. Labor Risk . Japan has an\naging workforce and has experienced a\nsignificant population decline in recent\nyears. Japan\u2019s labor market appears to be\nundergoing fundamental structural changes, as\na labor market traditionally accustomed to\nlifetime employment adjusts to meet the need\nfor increased labor mobility, which may\nadversely affect Japan\u2019s economic\ncompetitiveness. Large Government and\nCorporate Debt Risk . The Japanese economy\nfaces several concerns, including a financial\nsystem with large levels of nonperforming\nloans, over-leveraged corporate balance\nsheets, extensive cross-ownership by major\n\n33\n\ncorporations, a changing corporate governance\nstructure, and large government deficits.\nThese issues may cause a slowdown of the\nJapanese economy. Political Risk .\nHistorically, Japan has had unpredictable\nnational politics and may experience frequent\npolitical turnover. Future political\ndevelopments may lead to changes in policy\nthat might adversely affect then Underlying\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's investments. In\naddition, China has become an important\ntrading partner with Japan. Japan\u2019s political\nrelationship with China, however, has been\nstrained. Should political tension increase,\nit could adversely affect the Japanese economy\nand destabilize the region as a whole. Risk of\nInvesting in the Middle East. Many Middle\nEastern countries have little or no democratic\ntradition, and the political and legal systems\nin such countries may have an adverse impact\non the Fund or an Underlying Fund. Many\neconomies in the Middle East are highly\nreliant on income from the sale of oil and\nnatural gas or trade with countries involved\nin the sale of oil and natural gas, and their\neconomies are therefore vulnerable to changes\nin the market for oil and natural gas and\nforeign currency values. As global demand for\noil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle\nEastern economies may be significantly\nimpacted. In addition, many Middle Eastern\ngovernments have exercised and continue to\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector. In certain\ncases, a Middle Eastern country\u2019s government\nmay own or control many companies, including\nsome of the largest companies in the country.\nAccordingly, governmental actions in the\nfuture could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Middle Eastern\ncountries. This could affect private sector\ncompanies and the Fund or an Underlying Fund,\nas well as the value of securities in such\nUnderlying Funds' portfolios. Certain Middle\nEastern markets are in the earliest stages of\ndevelopment. As a result, there may be a high\nconcentration of market capitalization and\ntrading volume in a small number of issuers\nrepresenting a limited number of industries,\nas well as a high concentration of investors\nand financial intermediaries. Brokers in\nMiddle Eastern countries typically are fewer\nin number and less capitalized than brokers in\nthe U.S. The legal systems in certain Middle\nEastern countries also may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund or an Underlying Fund. For\nexample, the potential liability of a\nshareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect\nto acts of the corporation generally is\nlimited to the amount of the shareholder\u2019s\ninvestment. However, the notion of limited\nliability is less clear in certain Middle\nEastern countries. Each Fund or the Underlying\nFunds therefore may be liable in certain\nMiddle Eastern countries for the acts of a\ncorporation in which it invests for an amount\ngreater than its actual investment in that\ncorporation. Similarly, the rights of\ninvestors in Middle Eastern issuers may be\nmore limited than those of shareholders of a\nU.S. corporation. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain or enforce a legal\njudgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some\nMiddle Eastern countries prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on investments in\ntheir capital markets, particularly their\nequity markets, by foreign entities such as an\nUnderlying Fund. For example, certain\ncountries may require governmental approval\nprior to investment by foreign persons or\nlimit the amount of investment by foreign\npersons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle\nEastern countries may also limit investment by\nforeign persons to only a specific class of\nsecurities of an issuer that may have less\nadvantageous terms (including price) than\nsecurities of the issuer available for\npurchase by nationals of the relevant Middle\nEastern country. The manner in which foreign\ninvestors may invest in companies in certain\nMiddle Eastern countries, as well as\nlimitations on those investments, may have an\nadverse impact on the operations of an\nUnderlying Fund or the Underlying Funds. For\nexample, in certain of these countries, an\nUnderlying Fund may be required to invest\ninitially through a local broker or other\nentity and then have the shares that were\npurchased re-registered in the name of the\nFund or the Underlying Funds. Re-registration\nin some instances may not be possible on a\ntimely basis. This may result in a delay\nduring which an Underlying Fund may be denied\ncertain of its rights as an investor,\nincluding rights as to dividends or to be made\naware of certain corporate actions. There also\nmay be instances where an Underlying Fund\nplaces a purchase order but is subsequently\ninformed, at the time of re-registration, that\nthe permissible allocation of the investment\nto foreign investors has already been filled\nand, consequently, an Underlying Fund may not\nbe able to invest in the relevant company.\nSubstantial limitations may exist in certain\nMiddle Eastern countries with respect to an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s ability to repatriate\ninvestment income or capital gains. The\nUnderlying Fund could be adversely affected by\ndelays in, or a refusal to grant, any required\ngovernmental approval for repatriation of\ncapital, as well as by the application to the\nUnderlying Fund of any restrictions on\ninvestment.\n\n34\n\nCertain Middle Eastern countries may be\nheavily dependent upon international trade\nand, consequently, have been and may continue\nto be negatively affected by trade barriers,\nexchange controls, managed adjustments in\nrelative currency values and other\nprotectionist measures imposed or negotiated\nby the countries with which they trade. These\ncountries also have been and may continue to\nbe adversely impacted by economic conditions\nin the countries with which they trade. In\naddition, certain issuers located in Middle\nEastern countries in which an Underlying Fund\ninvests may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer which operates in, or\nhas dealings with, such countries. The\nUnderlying Fund, as an investor in such\nissuers, will be indirectly subject to those\nrisks. Certain Middle Eastern countries have\nstrained relations with other Middle Eastern\ncountries due to territorial disputes,\nhistorical animosities, international\nalliances, defense concerns or other reasons,\nwhich may adversely affect the economies of\nthese Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle\nEastern countries experience significant\nunemployment, as well as widespread\nunderemployment. There has also been a recent\nincrease in recruitment efforts and an\naggressive push for territorial control by\nterrorist groups in the region, which has led\nto an outbreak of warfare and hostilities.\nWarfare in Syria has spread to surrounding\nareas, including many portions of Iraq and\nTurkey. Such hostilities may continue into the\nfuture or may escalate at any time due to\nethnic, racial, political, religious or\nideological tensions between groups in the\nregion or foreign intervention or lack of\nintervention, among other factors. Risk of\nInvesting in North America. A decrease in\nimports or exports, changes in trade\nregulations or an economic recession in any\nNorth American country can have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire North American\nregion and on some or all of the North\nAmerican countries in which certain of the\nUnderlying Funds invest. The U.S. is Canada's\nand Mexico's largest trading and investment\npartner. The Canadian and Mexican economies\nare significantly affected by developments in\nthe U.S. economy. Since the implementation of\nthe North American Free Trade Agreement ( \u201c\nNAFTA \u201d ) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and\nMexico, total merchandise trade among the\nthree countries has increased. However,\npolitical developments including the\nimplementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the\nrenegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the\nUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ( \u201c\nUSMCA \u201d ), which replaced NAFTA on July 1,\n2020, could negatively affect North America\u2019s\neconomic outlook and, as a result, the value\nof securities held by an Underlying Fund.\nPolicy and legislative changes in one country\nmay have a significant effect on North\nAmerican markets generally, as well as on the\nvalue of certain securities held by an\nUnderlying Fund. Risk of Investing in Russia.\nInvesting in the Russian securities market\ninvolves a high degree of risk and special\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the U.S. securities market, and\nshould be considered highly speculative. Risks\ninclude: the absence of developed legal\nstructures governing private and foreign\ninvestments and private property; the\npossibility of the loss of all or a\nsubstantial portion of an Underlying Fund\u2019s\nassets invested in Russia as a result of\nexpropriation; certain national policies which\nmay restrict the Underlying Fund\u2019s investment\nopportunities, including, without limitation,\nrestrictions on investing in issuers or\nindustries deemed sensitive to relevant\nnational interests; and potentially greater\nprice volatility in, significantly smaller\ncapitalization of, and relative illiquidity\nof, the Russian market. There can also be no\nassurance that an Underlying Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in the Russian securities market\nwould not be expropriated, nationalized or\notherwise confiscated. In the event of the\nsettlement of any such claims or such\nexpropriation, nationalization or other\nconfiscation, an Underlying Fund could lose\nits entire investment. In addition, it may be\ndifficult and more costly to obtain and\nenforce a judgment in the Russian court\nsystem. Russia may also be subject to a\ngreater degree of economic, political and\nsocial instability than is the case in other\ndeveloped countries. Such instability may\nresult from, among other things, the\nfollowing: (i) an authoritarian government or\nmilitary involvement in political and economic\ndecision-making, including changes in\ngovernment through extra-constitutional means;\n(ii) popular unrest associated with demands\nfor improved political, economic and social\nconditions; (iii) internal insurgencies; (iv)\nhostile relations, including armed conflict,\nwith neighboring countries; and (v) ethnic,\nreligious and racial disaffection. The Russian\neconomy is heavily dependent upon the export\nof a range of commodities including most\nindustrial metals, forestry products and oil\nand gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected\nby international commodity prices and is\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. Any acts of\nterrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or\ninternationally could have an adverse effect\non the financial and commodities markets and\nthe global economy. As Russia produces and\nexports large amounts of crude oil and gas,\nany acts of terrorism or armed conflict\ncausing disruptions of\n\n35\n\nRussian oil and gas exports could negatively\naffect the Russian economy and, thus,\nadversely affect the financial condition,\nresults of operations or prospects of related\ncompanies. Current and future economic\nsanctions may also adversely affect the\nRussian oil, banking, mining, metals, rail,\npipeline and gas sectors, among other sectors.\nThe Russian government may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector and may own or control many\ncompanies. Future government actions could\nhave a significant effect on the economic\nconditions in Russia, which could have a\nnegative impact on private sector companies.\nThere is also the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments that could adversely affect\ninvestments in Russia. In recent years, the\nRussian government has begun to take bolder\nsteps to re-assert its regional geopolitical\ninfluence (including military steps) and\nlaunched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on\nFebruary 24, 2022. Additionally, Russia is\nalleged to have participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Such steps\nhave increased tensions between Russia and its\nneighbors and Western countries and may\nnegatively affect economic growth. Actual and\nthreatened responses by other nation-states to\nRussia\u2019s alleged cyber activity may have an\nadverse impact on the Russian economy and the\nRussian issuers of securities in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests. For example, the U.S.\nhas added certain foreign technology companies\nto the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of\nIndustry and Security\u2019s \u201c Entity List, \u201d which\nis a list of companies believed to pose a\nnational security risk to the U.S. Actions\nlike these may have unanticipated and\ndisruptive effects on the Russian economy.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia\u2019s\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich an Underlying Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Russia Sanctions . Governments in\nthe U.S. and many other countries\n(collectively, the \u201c Sanctioning Bodies \u201d )\nhave imposed economic sanctions on certain\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nand Russian corporate and banking entities,\nincluding banning Russia from global payments\nsystems that facilitate cross-border payments.\nThe Sanctioning Bodies, or others, could also\ninstitute broader sanctions on Russia. These\nsanctions, or even the threat of further\nsanctions, may result in the decline of the\nvalue and liquidity of Russian securities, a\nweakening of the ruble or other adverse\nconsequences to the Russian economy. These\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Russian securities and/or funds\ninvested in prohibited assets, impairing the\nability of an Underlying Fund to buy, sell,\nreceive or deliver those securities and/or\nassets. Recently, Russia has issued a number\nof countersanctions, some of which restrict\nthe distribution of profits by limited\nliability companies ( e.g. , dividends), and\nprohibits Russian persons from entering into\ntransactions with designated persons from \u201c\nunfriendly states \u201d as well as the export of\nraw materials or other products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons. The sanctions\nagainst certain Russian issuers include\nprohibitions on transacting in or dealing in\nissuances of debt or equity of such issuers.\nCompliance with each of these sanctions has\nand may continue to impair the ability of an\nUnderlying Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive or\ndeliver the affected securities or other\nsecurities of such issuers. If it becomes\nimpracticable or unlawful for an Underlying\nFund to hold securities subject to, or\notherwise affected by, sanctions\n(collectively, \u201c affected securities \u201d ), or\nif deemed appropriate by BFA, an Underlying\nFund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the\naffected securities in connection with\ncreation transactions and instead require a\ncash deposit, which may also increase an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s transaction costs. An\nUnderlying Fund may also be legally required\nto freeze assets in a blocked account.\nSanctions have resulted in Russia taking\ncounter measures or retaliatory actions, which\nhas impaired the value and liquidity of\nRussian securities. These retaliatory measures\ninclude the immediate freeze of Russian assets\nheld by an Underlying Fund. Due to such a\nfreeze of these assets, including depositary\nreceipts, an Underlying Fund may need to\nliquidate non-restricted assets in order to\nsatisfy any Fund redemption orders. The\nliquidation of Fund assets during this time\nmay also result in an Underlying Fund\nreceiving substantially lower prices for its\nsecurities. Russia may implement additional\nretaliatory measures, which may further impair\nthe value and liquidity of Russian securities\nand the ability of the Fund to receive\ndividend payments. Recently, Russia has issued\na number of countersanctions, some of which\nrestrict the distribution of profits by\nlimited liability companies ( e.g. ,\ndividends), and prohibits Russian persons from\nentering into transactions with designated\n\n36\n\npersons from \u201c unfriendly states \u201d as well as\nthe export of raw materials or other products\nfrom Russia to certain sanctioned persons.\nRussian companies may be unable to pay\ndividends and, if they pay dividends, the Fund\nmay be unable to receive them. These\nsanctions, the decision by Russia to suspend\ntrading on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and\nprohibit non-resident investors from executing\nsecurity sales, and other events have led to\nchanges in certain of the Underlying Indexes\nof the Underlying Funds. The Underlying Fund\u2019s\nIndex Providers have removed Russian\nsecurities where present in an Underlying\nIndex of an Underlying Fund. To the extent\nthat an Underlying Fund rebalances its\nportfolio and trades in non-Russian securities\nto seek to track the investment results of its\nUnderlying Index, this may result in\ntransaction costs and increased tracking\nerror. The Underlying Funds are currently\nrestricted from trading in Russian securities,\nincluding those in their portfolios, while an\nUnderlying Fund's Underlying Index has removed\nRussian securities. For Underlying Funds with\nRussian securities, this disparity will also\nlead to increased tracking error. The\ninability of an Underlying Fund to trade in\nRussian securities may adversely affect an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s ability to meet its\ninvestment objective. It is unknown when, or\nif, sanctions may be lifted or an Underlying\nFund\u2019s ability to trade in Russian securities\nwill resume. Also, if an affected security is\nincluded in an Underlying Fund\u2019s Underlying\nIndex, an Underlying Fund may, where\npracticable, seek to eliminate its holdings of\nthe affected security by employing or\naugmenting its representative sampling\nstrategy to seek to track the investment\nresults of its Underlying Index. The use of\n(or increased use of) a representative\nsampling strategy may increase an Underlying\nFund\u2019s tracking error risk. If the affected\nsecurities constitute a significant percentage\nof the Underlying Index, an Underlying Fund\nmay not be able to effectively implement a\nrepresentative sampling strategy, which may\nresult in significant tracking error between\nan Underlying Fund\u2019s performance and the\nperformance of its Underlying Index. Risk of\nInvesting in Saudi Arabia. The ability of\nforeign investors (such as an Underlying Fund)\nto invest in the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers is relatively new. Such ability could\nbe restricted by the Saudi Arabian government\nat any time, and unforeseen risks could\nmaterialize with respect to foreign ownership\nin such securities. In addition, the Capital\nMarket Authority ( \u201c CMA \u201d ) places investment\nlimitations on the ownership of the securities\nof Saudi Arabian issuers by foreign investors,\nincluding a limitation on an Underlying Fund\u2019s\nownership of the securities of any single\nissuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock\nExchange, which may prevent an Underlying Fund\nfrom investing in accordance with its strategy\nand contribute to tracking error against the\nUnderlying Index. These restrictions may be\nchanged or new restrictions, such as licensing\nrequirements, special approvals or additional\nforeign taxes, may be instituted at any time.\nAn Underlying Fund may not be able to obtain\nor maintain any such licenses or approvals and\nmay not be able to buy and sell securities at\nfull value. Major disruptions or regulatory\nchanges could occur in the Saudi Arabian\nmarket, any of which could negatively impact\nan Underlying Fund. These risks may be\nexacerbated, compared to more developed\nmarkets, given the limited history of foreign\ninvestment in the Saudi Arabian market.\nInvestments in Saudi Arabia may also be\nsubject to loss due to expropriation or\nnationalization of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on additional\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital. Such heightened risks may include,\namong others, restrictions on and government\nintervention in international trade,\nconfiscatory taxation, political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision making,\narmed conflict, crime and instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has\nprivatized, or has begun the process of\nprivatizing, certain entities and industries.\nNewly privatized companies may face strong\ncompetition from government-sponsored\ncompetitors that have not been privatized. In\nsome instances, investors in newly privatized\nentities have suffered losses due to the\ninability of the newly privatized entities to\nadjust quickly to a competitive environment or\nchanging regulatory and legal standards or, in\nsome cases, due to re-nationalization of such\nprivatized entities. There is no assurance\nthat similar losses will not recur. Saudi\nArabia is highly reliant on income from the\nsale of petroleum and trade with other\ncountries involved in the sale of petroleum,\nand its economy is therefore vulnerable to\nchanges in foreign currency values and the\nmarket for petroleum, as well as acts\ntargeting petroleum production or processing\nfacilities in Saudi Arabia. As global demand\nfor petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be\nsignificantly impacted. In the recent past,\nthe Saudi Arabian government has explored\nprivatization and diversification of the\neconomy in the wake of a diminished petroleum\nmarket. Like most Middle Eastern governments,\nthe government of Saudi Arabia exercises\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector. Although liberalization in the\nwider economy is underway, in many areas it\nhas lagged significantly: restrictions on\nforeign ownership persist, and the government\nhas an ownership stake in many key industries.\nThe situation is exacerbated by the fact that\nSaudi Arabia is governed by an absolute\nmonarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents.\n\n37\n\nIncidents involving a Middle Eastern country\u2019s\nor the region\u2019s security, including terrorism,\nmay cause uncertainty in their markets and may\nadversely affect its economy and an Underlying\nFund\u2019s investments. Governmental actions in\nthe future could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which\ncould affect private sector companies and an\nUnderlying Fund, as well as the value of\nsecurities in an Underlying Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nAny economic sanctions on Saudi Arabian\nindividuals or Saudi Arabian corporate\nentities, or even the threat of sanctions, may\nresult in the decline of the value and\nliquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a\nweakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse\nconsequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. Any\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Saudi Arabian securities and/or\nfunds investing in prohibited assets,\nimpairing the ability of an Underlying Fund to\nbuy, sell, receive or deliver those securities\nand/or assets. In addition, Saudi Arabia\u2019s\neconomy relies heavily on cheap, foreign\nlabor, and changes in the availability of this\nlabor supply could have an adverse effect on\nthe economy. The securities markets in Saudi\nArabia may not be as developed as those in\nother countries. As a result, securities\nmarkets in Saudi Arabia are subject to greater\nrisks associated with market volatility, lower\nmarket capitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations, uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets, governmental\ncontrol and heavy regulation of labor and\nindustry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian\ncompanies tend to trade less frequently than\nthose of companies on exchanges in more\ndeveloped markets. Such infrequent trading may\nadversely affect the pricing of these\nsecurities and an Underlying Fund\u2019s ability to\nsell these securities in the future. Although\nthe political situation in Saudi Arabia is\nlargely stable, Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced political instability, and there\nremains the possibility that the stability\nwill not hold in the future or that\ninstability in the larger Middle East region\ncould adversely impact the economy of Saudi\nArabia. Instability may be caused by military\ndevelopments, government interventions in the\nmarketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes,\nattempted social or political reforms,\nreligious differences, or other factors.\nAdditionally, anti-Western views held by\ncertain groups in the Middle East may\ninfluence government policies regarding\nforeign investment. Further developments in\nU.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other\nMiddle-Eastern countries may affect these\nattitudes and policies. The U.S. is a\nsignificant trading partner of, or foreign\ninvestor in, Saudi Arabia. As a result,\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be\nparticularly affected by changes in the U.S.\neconomy. A decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, new trade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar\nexchange rate or an economic slowdown in the\nU.S. may have a material adverse effect on the\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a\nresult, securities to which an Underlying Fund\nhas exposure. Political instability in North\nAfrica and the larger Middle East region has\ncaused significant disruptions to many\nindustries. Continued political and social\nunrest in these areas may negatively affect\nthe value of securities in an Underlying\nFund\u2019s portfolio. Certain issuers located in\nSaudi Arabia may operate in, or have dealings\nwith, countries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain\ndamage to its reputation if it is identified\nas an issuer which operates in, or has\ndealings with, such countries. An Underlying\nFund, as an investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. Risk of\nInvesting in the Basic Materials Industry.\nIssuers in the basic materials industry could\nbe adversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, inflation, exchange rate\nfluctuations, social and political unrest,\nimport controls and increased competition.\nCompanies in the basic materials industry may\nbe subject to swift fluctuations in supply and\ndemand. Fluctuations may be caused by events\nrelating to political and economic\ndevelopments, the environmental impact of\nbasic materials operations, and the success of\nexploration projects. Production of industrial\nmaterials often exceeds demand as a result of\nover-building or economic downturns, leading\nto poor investment returns. Issuers in the\nbasic materials industry are at risk for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may be adversely affected by\ndepletion of resources, delays in technical\nprogress, labor relations, tax and government\nregulations related to changes to, among other\nthings, energy and environmental policies.\nRisk of Investing in the Communication\nServices Sector. The communication services\nsector consists of both companies in the\ntelecommunication services industry as well as\nthose in the media and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the telecommunication\nservices industry group include providers of\nfiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services and products\nincluding television broadcasting, gaming\nproducts, social media, networking platforms,\nonline classifieds, online review websites,\nand Internet search engines. Companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be affected\nby industry competition, substantial capital\nrequirements, government regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications\n\n38\n\nproducts and services due to technological\nadvancement. Fluctuating domestic and\ninternational demand, shifting demographics\nand often unpredictable changes in consumer\ntastes can drastically affect a communication\nservices company's profitability. In addition,\nwhile all companies may be susceptible to\nnetwork security breaches, certain companies\nin the communication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Risk of Investing in the Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector. Companies engaged in the\ndesign, production or distribution of products\nor services for the consumer discretionary\nsector (including, without limitation,\ntelevision and radio broadcasting,\nmanufacturing, publishing, recording and\nmusical instruments, motion pictures,\nphotography, amusement and theme parks, gaming\ncasinos, sporting goods and sports arenas,\ncamping and recreational equipment, toys and\ngames, apparel, travel-related services,\nautomobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food\nand other restaurants) are subject to the risk\nthat their products or services may become\nobsolete quickly. The success of these\ncompanies can depend heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending. During\nperiods of an expanding economy, the consumer\ndiscretionary sector may outperform the\nconsumer staples sector, but may underperform\nwhen economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the\nconsumer discretionary sector can be\nsignificantly affected by several factors,\nincluding, without limitation, the performance\nof domestic and international economies,\nexchange rates, changing consumer preferences,\ndemographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical\nrevenue generation, consumer confidence,\ncommodity price volatility, labor relations,\ninterest rates, import and export controls,\nintense competition, technological\ndevelopments and government regulation. Risk\nof Investing in the Consumer Services\nIndustry. The success of firms in the consumer\nservices industry and certain retailers\n(including food and beverage, general\nretailers, media, and travel and leisure) is\ntied closely to the performance of the\ndomestic and international economy, interest\nrates, exchange rates, competition and\nconsumer confidence. The consumer services\nindustry depends heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending.\nCompanies in the consumer services industry\nmay be subject to severe competition, which\nmay also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Companies in the consumer\nservices industry are facing increased\ngovernment and regulatory scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or regulatory\naction. Changes in demographics and consumer\npreferences may affect the success of consumer\nservice providers.\n\n39\n\nRisk of Investing in the Consumer Staples\nSector. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may be adversely affected by changes in\nthe global economy, consumer spending,\ncompetition, demographics and consumer\npreferences, and production spending.\nCompanies in the consumer staples sector may\nalso be affected by changes in global\neconomic, environmental and political events,\neconomic conditions, the depletion of\nresources, and government regulation. For\ninstance, government regulations may affect\nthe permissibility of using various food\nadditives and production methods of companies\nthat make food products, which could affect\ncompany profitability. In addition, tobacco\ncompanies may be adversely affected by the\nadoption of proposed legislation and/or by\nlitigation. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector also may be subject to risks pertaining\nto the supply of, demand for and prices of raw\nmaterials. The prices of raw materials\nfluctuate in response to a number of factors,\nincluding, without limitation, changes in\ngovernment agricultural support programs,\nexchange rates, import and export controls,\nchanges in international agricultural and\ntrading policies, and seasonal and weather\nconditions. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Risk of Investing in the Energy\nSector. Companies in the energy sector are\nstrongly affected by the changes in and\nvolatility of global energy prices, energy\nsupply and demand, government regulations and\npolicies, energy production and conservation\nefforts, technological change, development of\nalternative energy sources, and other factors\nthat they cannot control. Energy companies may\nhave relatively high levels of debt and may be\nmore likely to restructure their businesses if\nthere are downturns in energy markets or in\nthe global economy. If an energy company in an\nUnderlying Fund's portfolio becomes\ndistressed, the Underlying Fund could lose all\nor a substantial portion of its investment.\nThe energy sector is cyclical and is highly\ndependent on commodity prices. Prices and\nsupplies of energy may fluctuate significantly\nover short and long periods of time due to,\namong other things, national and international\npolitical changes, Organization of Petroleum\nExporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d ) policies,\nchanges in relationships among OPEC members\nand between OPEC and oil-importing nations,\nthe regulatory environment, taxation policies,\nthe enactment or cessation of trade sanctions,\nwar or other geopolitical conflicts, and the\neconomies of key energy-consuming countries.\nCompanies in the energy sector may be\nadversely affected by terrorism, cyber\nincidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to predict and depend on a number\nof factors. The effect of these events or any\nrelated developments could be significant and\nmay have a severe adverse effect on the\nperformance of an Underlying Fund. Risk of\nInvesting in the Financials Sector. Companies\nin the financials sector include small,\nregional and money center banks, securities\nbrokerage firms, asset management companies,\nsavings banks and thrift institutions,\nspecialty finance companies ( e.g. , credit\ncard, mortgage providers), insurance and\ninsurance brokerage firms, consumer finance\nfirms, financial conglomerates and foreign\nbanking and financial companies. Most\nfinancial companies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which limits their\nactivities and may affect their ability to\nearn a profit from a given line of business.\nGovernment regulation may change frequently\nand may have significant\n\n40\n\nadverse consequences for companies in the\nfinancials sector, including effects not\nintended by the regulation. Direct\ngovernmental intervention in the operations of\nfinancial companies and financial markets may\nmaterially and adversely affect the companies\nin which an Underlying Fund invests, including\nlegislation in many countries that may\nincrease government regulation, repatriation\nand other intervention. The impact of\ngovernmental intervention and legislative\nchanges on any individual financial company or\non the financials sector as a whole cannot be\npredicted. The valuation of financial\ncompanies has been and continues to be subject\nto unprecedented volatility and may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors, including\ninterest rate risk and sovereign debt default.\nCertain financial businesses are subject to\nintense competitive pressures, including\nmarket share and price competition. Financial\ncompanies in foreign countries are subject to\nmarket-specific and general regulatory and\ninterest rate concerns. In particular,\ngovernment regulation in certain foreign\ncountries may include taxes and controls on\ninterest rates, credit availability, minimum\ncapital requirements, bans on short sales,\nlimits on prices and restrictions on currency\ntransfers. In addition, companies in the\nfinancials sector may be the targets of\nhacking and potential theft of proprietary or\ncustomer information or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a material adverse\neffect on their businesses. The profitability\nof banks, savings and loan associations and\nother financial companies is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change; for instance, when interest\nrates go up, the value of securities issued by\nmany types of companies in the financials\nsector generally goes down. In other words,\nfinancial companies may be adversely affected\nin certain market cycles, including, without\nlimitation, during periods of rising interest\nrates, which may restrict the availability and\nincrease the cost of capital, and during\nperiods of declining economic conditions,\nwhich may cause, among other things, credit\nlosses due to financial difficulties of\nborrowers. In addition, general economic\nconditions are important to the operations of\nthese companies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products. Patents have a limited\nduration, and, upon expiration, other\ncompanies may market substantially similar \u201c\ngeneric \u201d products that are typically sold at\na lower price than the patented product, which\ncan cause the original developer of the\nproduct to lose market share and/or reduce the\nprice charged for the product, resulting in\nlower profits for the original developer. As a\nresult, the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. In addition, because the products\nand services of many companies in the\nhealthcare sector affect the health and well-\nbeing of many individuals, these companies are\nespecially susceptible to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and similar claims.\nHealthcare companies are subject to\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Many new products in the\nhealthcare sector may be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of obtaining such\napprovals may be long and costly, which can\nresult in increased development costs, delayed\ncost recovery\n\n41\n\nand loss of competitive advantage to the\nextent that rival companies have developed\ncompeting products or procedures, adversely\naffecting the company\u2019s revenues and\nprofitability. In other words, delays in the\nregulatory approval process may diminish the\nopportunity for a company to profit from a new\nproduct or to bring a new product to market,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on\na company\u2019s business. Healthcare companies may\nalso be strongly affected by scientific\nbiotechnology or technological developments,\nand their products may quickly become\nobsolete. Also, many healthcare companies\noffer products and services that are subject\nto governmental regulation and may be\nadversely affected by changes in governmental\npolicies or laws. Changes in governmental\npolicies or laws may span a wide range of\ntopics, including cost control, national\nhealth insurance, incentives for compensation\nin the provision of healthcare services, tax\nincentives and penalties related to healthcare\ninsurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid\nhealthcare plans. In addition, a number of\nlegislative proposals concerning healthcare\nhave been considered by the U.S. Congress in\nrecent years. It is unclear what proposals\nwill ultimately be enacted, if any, and what\neffect they may have on companies in the\nhealthcare sector. Additionally, the expansion\nof facilities by healthcare-related providers\nmay be subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d\nby certain government authorities. This\nprocess not only generally increases the time\nand costs involved in these expansions, but\nalso makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting\nthe revenue and profitability growth potential\nof healthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Industrials Sector. The value\nof securities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply of and demand for both their\nspecific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, companies in the industrials\nsector may be subject to liability for\nenvironmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nRisk of Investing in the Information\nTechnology Sector. Information technology\ncompanies face intense competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, which may\nhave an adverse effect on profit margins. Like\nother technology companies, information\ntechnology companies may have limited product\nlines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. The products of information\ntechnology companies may face product\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction, unpredictable changes in growth\nrates and competition for the services of\nqualified personnel. Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Companies in the information\ntechnology sector are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights. The\nloss or impairment of these rights may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. Information technology companies\nare facing increased government and regulatory\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or regulatory action. Finally,\nwhile all companies may be susceptible to\nnetwork security breaches, certain companies\nin the information technology sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThese risks are heightened for information\ntechnology companies in foreign markets. Risk\nof Investing in the Materials Sector.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control,\namong other factors. Such risks may adversely\naffect the issuers to which the Fund has\nexposure. Companies in the materials sector\nare also at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in the Real\nEstate Industry. Companies in the real estate\nindustry include companies that invest in real\nestate, such as REITs, real estate holding and\noperating companies or real estate development\ncompanies (collectively, \u201c Real Estate\nCompanies \u201d ). Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies exposes investors to the risks of\nowning real estate directly, as well as to\nrisks that relate specifically to the way in\nwhich Real Estate Companies are organized and\noperated. The real estate\n\n42\n\nindustry is highly sensitive to general and\nlocal economic conditions and developments,\nand characterized by intense competition and\nperiodic overbuilding. Investing in Real\nEstate Companies involves various risks. Some\nrisks that are specific to Real Estate\nCompanies are discussed in greater detail\nbelow. Concentration Risk. Real Estate\nCompanies may own a limited number of\nproperties and concentrate their investments\nin a particular geographic region or property\ntype. Economic downturns affecting a\nparticular region, industry or property type\nmay lead to a high volume of defaults within a\nshort period. Distressed Investment Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may invest in distressed,\ndefaulted or out-of-favor bank loans.\nIdentification and implementation by a Real\nEstate Company of loan modification and\nrestructure programs involves a high degree of\nuncertainty. Even successful implementation\nmay still require adverse compromises and may\nnot prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies\nmay also invest in other debt instruments that\nmay become non-performing, including the\nsecurities of companies with higher credit and\nmarket risk due to financial or operational\ndifficulties. Higher risk securities may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the\nsecurities of companies not in distress.\nIlliquidity Risk. Investing in Real Estate\nCompanies may involve risks similar to those\nassociated with investing in small-\ncapitalization companies. Real Estate Company\nsecurities, like the securities of small-\ncapitalization companies, may be more volatile\nthan, and perform differently from, shares of\nlarge-capitalization companies. There may be\nless trading in Real Estate Company shares,\nwhich means that buy and sell transactions in\nthose shares could have a magnified impact on\nshare price, resulting in abrupt or erratic\nprice fluctuations. In addition, real estate\nis relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real\nEstate Company may have a limited ability to\nvary or liquidate properties in response to\nchanges in economic or other conditions.\nInterest Rate Risk. Rising interest rates\ncould result in higher costs of capital for\nReal Estate Companies, which could negatively\nimpact a Real Estate Company\u2019s ability to meet\nits payment obligations. Declining interest\nrates could result in increased prepayment on\nloans and require redeployment of capital in\nless desirable investments. Leverage Risk.\nReal Estate Companies may use leverage (and\nsome may be highly leveraged), which increases\ninvestment risk and could adversely affect a\nReal Estate Company\u2019s operations and market\nvalue in periods of rising interest rates.\nReal Estate Companies are also exposed to the\nrisks normally associated with debt financing.\nFinancial covenants related to a Real Estate\nCompany\u2019s leverage may affect the ability of\nthe Real Estate Company to operate\neffectively. In addition, real property may be\nsubject to the quality of credit extended and\ndefaults by borrowers and tenants. If the\nproperties do not generate sufficient income\nto meet operating expenses, including, where\napplicable, debt service, ground lease\npayments, tenant improvements, third-party\nleasing commissions and other capital\nexpenditures, the income and ability of a Real\nEstate Company to make payments of any\ninterest and principal on its debt securities\nwill be adversely affected. Loan Foreclosure\nRisk. Real Estate Companies may foreclose on\nloans that the Real Estate Company originated\nand/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate\nnegative publicity for the underlying property\nthat affects its market value. In addition to\nthe length and expense of such proceedings,\nthe validity of the terms of the applicable\nloan may not be recognized in foreclosure\nproceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by\nborrowers or other lenders may interfere with\nthe enforcement of rights by a Real Estate\nCompany. Parallel proceedings, such as\nbankruptcy, may also delay resolution and\nlimit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed\nloan by a Real Estate Company even where the\nproperty underlying the loan is liquidated.\nManagement Risk. Real Estate Companies are\ndependent upon management skills and may have\nlimited financial resources. Real Estate\nCompanies are generally not diversified and\nmay be subject to heavy cash flow dependency,\ndefault by borrowers and voluntary\nliquidation. In addition, transactions between\nReal Estate Companies and their affiliates may\nbe subject to conflicts of interest, which may\nadversely affect a Real Estate Company\u2019s\nshareholders. A Real Estate Company may also\nhave joint venture investments in certain of\nits properties, and, consequently, its ability\nto control decisions relating to such\nproperties may be limited. Property Risk. Real\nEstate Companies may be subject to risks\nrelating to functional obsolescence or reduced\ndesirability of properties; extended vacancies\ndue to economic conditions and tenant\nbankruptcies; catastrophic events such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts;\nand casualty or condemnation losses. Real\nestate income and values also may be greatly\naffected by demographic trends, such as\npopulation shifts or changes in consumer\npreferences and values, or increasing\nvacancies or declining rents resulting from\nlegal, cultural, technological, global or\nlocal economic developments. Regulatory Risk.\nReal estate income and values may be adversely\naffected by such factors as applicable\ndomestic and foreign laws (including tax\nlaws). Government actions, such as tax\nincreases, zoning law changes, mandated\nclosures or other\n\n43\n\ncommercial restrictions or environmental\nregulations, also may have a major impact on\nreal estate income and values. In addition,\nquarterly compliance with regulations limiting\nthe proportion of asset types held by a U.S.\nREIT may force certain Real Estate Companies\nto liquidate or restructure otherwise\nattractive investments. Some countries may not\nrecognize REITs or comparable structures as a\nviable form of real estate funds. Underlying\nInvestment Risk. Real Estate Companies make\ninvestments in a variety of debt and equity\ninstruments with varying risk profiles. For\ninstance, Real Estate Companies may invest in\ndebt instruments secured by commercial\nproperty that have higher risks of delinquency\nand foreclosure than loans on single family\nhomes due to a variety of factors associated\nwith commercial property, including the tie\nbetween income available to service debt and\nproductive use of the property. Real Estate\nCompanies may also invest in debt instruments\nand preferred equity that are junior in an\nissuer\u2019s capital structure and that involve\nprivately negotiated structures. Subordinated\ndebt investments, such as B-Notes and\nmezzanine loans, involve a greater credit risk\nof default due to the need to service more\nsenior debt of the issuer. Similarly,\npreferred equity investments involve a greater\nrisk of loss than conventional debt financing\ndue to their non-collateralized nature and\nsubordinated ranking. Investments in\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities may also\nbe junior in priority in the event of\nbankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments\nin senior loans may be effectively\nsubordinated if the senior loan is pledged as\ncollateral. The ability of a holder of junior\nclaims to proceed against a defaulting issuer\nis circumscribed by the terms of the\nparticular contractual arrangement, which vary\nconsiderably from transaction to transaction.\nU.S. Tax Risk. Certain U.S. Real Estate\nCompanies are subject to special U.S. federal\ntax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply\nwith such tax requirements may be subject to\nU.S. federal income taxation, which may affect\nthe value of the REIT and the characterization\nof the REIT\u2019s distributions. The U.S. federal\ntax requirement that a REIT distribute\nsubstantially all of its net income to its\nshareholders may result in a REIT having\ninsufficient capital for future expenditures.\nA REIT that successfully maintains its\nqualification may still become subject to U.S.\nfederal, state and local taxes, including\nexcise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage\nrecording, and transfer taxes, both directly\nand indirectly through its subsidiaries.\nBecause REITs often do not provide complete\ntax information until after the calendar year-\nend, a Fund may at times need to request\npermission to extend the deadline for issuing\nyour tax reporting statement or supplement the\ninformation otherwise provided to you. Risk of\nInvesting in the Utilities Sector. The\nutilities sector may be adversely affected by\nchanging commodity prices, government\nregulation stipulating rates charged by\nutilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax\nlaws, interest rate fluctuations and changes\nin the cost of providing specific utility\nservices. The utilities industry is also\nsubject to potential terrorist attacks,\nnatural disasters and severe weather\nconditions, as well as regulatory and\noperational burdens associated with the\noperation and maintenance of nuclear\nfacilities. Government regulators monitor and\ncontrol utility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility profits. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in an Underlying Fund's portfolio may own\nor operate nuclear generating facilities.\nGovernmental authorities may from time to time\nreview existing policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures.\n\n44\n\nProxy Voting Policy For the Fund, the Board\nhas delegated the voting of proxies for the\nFund\u2019s securities to BFA pursuant to the\nFund's Proxy Voting Policy, and BFA has\nadopted policies and procedures (collectively,\nthe \u201c iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d )\ngoverning proxy voting by accounts managed by\nBFA, including the Fund. Under the iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote\nproxies related to Fund securities in the best\ninterests of the Fund and its shareholders.\nFrom time to time, a vote may present a\nconflict between the interests of the Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, on the one hand, and those of\nBFA, or any affiliated person of the Fund or\nBFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and\nprocedures that are designed to prevent undue\ninfluence on BFA\u2019s proxy voting activity that\nmight stem from any relationship between the\nissuer of a proxy (or any dissident\nshareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s affiliates, the\nFund or the Fund\u2019s affiliates. Most conflicts\nare managed through a structural separation of\nBFA\u2019s Corporate Governance Group from BFA\u2019s\nemployees with sales and client\nresponsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains\nprocedures to ensure that all engagements with\ncorporate issuers or dissident shareholders\nare managed consistently and without regard to\nBFA\u2019s relationship with the issuer of the\nproxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Fund's portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ended\nJune 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon\nrequest, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Fund's website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, the Fund discloses\non its website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of the Fund\u2019s next\nnet asset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: The Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of the Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to the Fund to\nsettle purchases of the Fund ( i.e. Deposit\nSecurities) or that Authorized Participants\nwould receive from the Fund to settle\nredemptions of the Fund ( i.e. Fund\nSecurities).

With respect to certain\nunderlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA\nor its affiliates have held discussions with\nthe applicable index provider regarding their\nbusiness interest in licensing an index to\ntrack a particular market segment and conveyed\ninvestment concepts and strategies that could\nbe considered for the index. The index\nprovider designed and constituted such indices\nusing concepts conveyed by BFA or its\naffiliates. For certain of these indices, the\nrelevant fund may be the first or sole user of\nthe underlying index. In its sole discretion,\nthe index provider determines the composition\nof the securities and other instruments in\nsuch underlying index, the rebalance protocols\nof the underlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and other instruments in the\nunderlying index, and any updates to the\nmethodology. From time to time, BFA or its\naffiliates may also provide input relating to\npossible methodology changes of such\nunderlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\nThe Morningstar \u00ae Multi-Asset High Income\nIndex SM The Morningstar Multi-Asset High\nIncome Index is broadly diversified and seeks\nto deliver high current income while\nmaintaining long-term capital appreciation.\nThe Underlying Index consists exclusively of\nU.S.-listed ETFs that collectively target\nequity, fixed-income and alternative asset\nclasses in fixed allocation weights. As of\nSeptember 23, 2024, the Underlying Index\nconsisted of 11 constituent ETFs. Index\nConstruction. The Underlying Index is governed\nby transparent, objective rules for security\nselection, exclusion, rebalancing, and\nadjustments for corporate actions, all of\nwhich are described in the Morningstar Multi-\nAsset High Income Index Rulebook (the \u201c Index\nRulebook \u201d ). Morningstar, Inc. ( \u201c\nMorningstar \u201d ) makes no subjective\ndeterminations related to index composition.\nTo be eligible for inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex, an ETF must track a benchmark that is\nbroadly representative of the asset class and\nbe registered as an investment company under\nthe 1940 Act. It must trade on a U.S.\nexchange, have at least a one year of trading\nhistory, a history of dividend payments, a\nthree-month average daily trading volume\ngreater than 25,000 shares, and meet certain\nasset minimums as elaborated in the Index\nRulebook. The goal of the Underlying Index is\nto represent an allocation strategy to\ndistinct asset classes of 20% equities, 60%\nfixed-income and 20% in an \u201c alternative\nincome sources \u201d asset class, which consists\nof Underlying Funds that the index provider,\n\n46\n\nMorningstar, considers to exhibit both equity\nand fixed-income-like characteristics. Each\nasset class has its own risk profile. The\nUnderlying Index is comprised of Underlying\nFunds, within these asset classes, that have\ndemonstrated relatively high income on a\nconsistent basis and meet liquidity\ncharacteristics as determined by Morningstar\nproprietary index methodology. The Underlying\nIndex will not exceed 25% investments in\nUnderlying Funds that have significant\nnon-U.S. currency exposure. Ineligible ETFs\ninclude those that had more than 10 non-\ntrading days in the prior quarter, those that\ninvest in securities of a single country,\nsector or industry, or in commodities, managed\nfutures, municipal bonds, or inflation linked\nstrategies, other allocated funds (ETF fund of\nfunds), including any ETFs on BlackRock's Rule\n12d1-4 List, available at www.iShares.com ,\nbank loan funds, convertible bond funds and\nMaster Limited Partnerships and any other\nexclusions, as defined in the Index Rulebook.\nOnce Morningstar has identified the investable\nuniverse, a proprietary model with an explicit\npreference for yield developed by\nMorningstar\u2019s Investment Management Group, is\napplied to identify index constituents, which\nare then further subject to liquidity and\nminimum asset screens. A fixed asset\nallocation and capping is then applied. Issue\nChanges. Securities are added or deleted from\neach index, on a quarterly basis, based on\nrules outlined for security selection,\nexclusion, rebalancing, and adjustments for\ncorporate actions as set forth in the Index\nRulebook. Index Maintenance. Scheduled\nReconstitution Dates . The Index is\nreconstituted quarterly. Adjustments are made\non the last business day of the month in\nFebruary, May, August, and November. The\nchanges become effective on the next business\nday. Scheduled Rebalancing Dates. The index is\nrebalanced quarterly. Adjustments are made at\nthe close of trade on the last business day in\nFebruary, May, August, and November. The\nchanges become effective on the next business\nday. The market data used for reconstitution\nand rebalance is as of previous month end.\nIndex Availability. Morningstar Indexes are\ncalculated continuously and are available from\nmajor data vendors. Investment Policies The\nBoard has adopted as fundamental policies the\nfollowing numbered investment policies, which\ncannot be changed without the approval of the\nholders of a majority of the Fund\u2019s\noutstanding voting securities. A vote of a\nmajority of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund is defined in the 1940 Act as the\nlesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities present at a shareholder meeting,\nif the holders of more than 50% of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (ii) more\nthan 50% of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund. The Fund has also adopted certain\nnon-fundamental investment policies, including\nits investment objective. Non-fundamental\ninvestment policies may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval. Therefore,\nthe Fund may change its investment objective\nand its Underlying Index without shareholder\napproval. Fundamental Investment Policies The\nFund will not: 1. Concentrate its investments\n( i.e. , invest 25% or more of its total\nassets in the securities of a particular\nindustry or group of industries), except that\nthe Fund will concentrate to approximately the\nsame extent that the Underlying Index\nconcentrates in the securities of such\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nFor purposes of this limitation, securities of\nthe U.S. government (including its agencies\nand instrumentalities), repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities,\nand securities of state or municipal\ngovernments and their political subdivisions\nare not considered to be issued by members of\nany industry. 2. Borrow money, except that (i)\nthe Fund may borrow from banks for temporary\nor emergency (not leveraging) purposes,\nincluding the meeting of redemption requests\nwhich might otherwise require the untimely\ndisposition of securities; and (ii) the Fund\nmay, to the extent consistent with its\ninvestment policies, enter into repurchase\nagreements, reverse\n\n47\n\nrepurchase agreements, forward roll\ntransactions and similar investment strategies\nand techniques. To the extent that it engages\nin transactions described in (i) and (ii), the\nFund will be limited so that no more than 33\n1/3% of the value of its total assets\n(including the amount borrowed) is derived\nfrom such transactions. Any borrowings which\ncome to exceed this amount will be reduced in\naccordance with applicable law. 3. Issue \u201c\nsenior securities \u201d as defined in the 1940 Act\nand the rules, regulations and orders\nthereunder, except as permitted under the 1940\nAct and the rules, regulation and orders\nthereunder. 4. Make loans, except as permitted\nunder the 1940 Act, as interpreted, modified\nor otherwise permitted by regulatory authority\nhaving jurisdiction, from time to time. 5.\nPurchase or sell real estate unless acquired\nas a result of ownership of securities or\nother instruments (but this restriction shall\nnot prevent the Fund from investing in\nsecurities of companies engaged in the real\nestate business or securities or other\ninstruments backed by real estate or\nmortgages), or commodities or commodity\ncontracts (but this restriction shall not\nprevent the Fund from trading in futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts,\nincluding options on currencies to the extent\nconsistent with the Fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and policies). 6. Engage in the\nbusiness of underwriting securities issued by\nother persons, except to the extent that the\nFund may technically be deemed to be an\nunderwriter under the 1933 Act, in disposing\nof portfolio securities. Non-Fundamental\nInvestment Policies The Fund has adopted a\nnon-fundamental policy not to invest in the\nsecurities of a company for the purpose of\nexercising management or control, or purchase\nor otherwise acquire any illiquid security,\nexcept as permitted under the 1940 Act, which\ncurrently permits up to 15% of the Fund's net\nassets to be invested in illiquid securities\n(calculated at the time of investment). If any\npercentage restriction described above is\ncomplied with at the time of an investment, a\nlater increase or decrease in percentage\nresulting from a change in values of assets\nwill not constitute a violation of such\nrestriction, except that certain percentage\nlimitations will be observed continuously in\naccordance with applicable law. In accordance\nwith Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act the Fund\nwill invest, under normal circumstances, at\nleast 80% of the value of its net assets, plus\nthe amount of any borrowings for investment\npurposes, in component securities based on its\nUnderlying Index. The Fund also has adopted a\npolicy to provide its shareholders with at\nleast 60 days' prior written notice of any\nchange in such policy. If, subsequent to an\ninvestment, the 80% requirement is no longer\nmet, the Fund's future investments will be\nmade in a manner that will bring the Fund into\ncompliance with this policy. Continuous\nOffering The method by which Creation Units\nare created and traded may raise certain\nissues under applicable securities laws.\nBecause new Creation Units are issued and sold\nby the Fund on an ongoing basis, at any point\na \u201c distribution, \u201d as such term is used in\nthe 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nthat could render them statutory underwriters\nand subject them to the prospectus delivery\nrequirement and liability provisions of the\n1933 Act. For example, a broker-dealer firm or\nits client may be deemed a statutory\nunderwriter if it takes Creation Units after\nplacing an order with the Distributor, breaks\nthem down into constituent shares and sells\nsuch shares directly to customers or if it\nchooses to couple the creation of new shares\nwith an active selling effort involving\nsolicitation of secondary market demand for\nshares. A determination of whether one is an\nunderwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must\ntake into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an underwriter.\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\neffecting transactions in shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nshares, generally are required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\n1933 Act is not available in respect of such\ntransactions as a result of Section 24(d) of\nthe 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus\ndelivery obligation with respect to shares of\nthe Fund are reminded that, pursuant to Rule\n153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery\nobligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933\n\n48\n\nAct owed to an exchange member in connection\nwith a sale on the Listing Exchange generally\nis satisfied by the fact that the prospectus\nis available at the Listing Exchange upon\nrequest. The prospectus delivery mechanism\nprovided in Rule 153 is available only with\nrespect to transactions on an exchange.\nManagement Trustees and Officers. The Board\nhas responsibility for the overall management\nand operations of the Fund, including general\nsupervision of the duties performed by BFA and\nother service providers.

The Fund is included in the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves\nas a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee\nof iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result,\noversees all of the funds within the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex, which consists of 404\nfunds as of December 1, 2023.

Board \u2013\nLeadership Structure and Oversight\nResponsibilities Overall responsibility for\noversight of the Fund rests with the Board.\nThe Board has engaged BFA to manage the Fund\non a day-to-day basis. The Board is\nresponsible for overseeing BFA and other\nservice providers in the operations of the\nFund in accordance with the provisions of the\n1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and\nother laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The Board\nis currently composed of eleven members, nine\nof whom are Independent Trustees. The Board\ncurrently conducts regular in person meetings\nfour times a year. In addition, the Board\nfrequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The Independent Trustees meet\nregularly outside the presence of management,\nin executive session or with other service\nproviders to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Fund, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Fund with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the\n\n56\n\noversight functions delegated to the Committee\nby the Board and reports its finding to the\nBoard. The Board and each standing Committee\nconduct annual assessments of their oversight\nfunction and structure. The Board has\ndetermined that the Board\u2019s leadership\nstructure is appropriate because it allows the\nBoard to exercise independent judgment over\nmanagement and it allocates areas of\nresponsibility among committees of Independent\nTrustees and the full Board to enhance\neffective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Fund is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. The\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Fund. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of the\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Fund. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by the Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting the Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Fund's\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support the Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight responsibilities.\nFrom time to time, the Board may modify the\nmanner in which it conducts risk oversight.\nThe Board\u2019s oversight role does not make it a\nguarantor of the Fund's investment performance\nor other activities.

Certain activities of\nBFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively\nreferred to in this section as \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, with respect to the Fund and/or\nother accounts managed by BlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\n\n63\n\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, including the business units or\nentities and personnel who may be involved in\nthe investment activities and business\noperations of the Fund, are engaged worldwide\nin businesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Fund. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by the Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of the\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or client accounts, will be executed\nindependently of the Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFund. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell\nthe same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding the Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor the Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of the\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding\nthe Fund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for the Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause the Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so. Conflicts may also\narise because portfolio decisions regarding\nthe Fund may benefit other accounts managed by\nBlackRock. For example, the sale of a long\nposition or establishment of a short position\nby the Fund may impair the price of the same\nsecurity sold short by (and therefore benefit)\nBlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and\nthe purchase of a security or covering of a\nshort position in a security by the Fund may\nincrease the price of the same security held\nby (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its\nother accounts or funds. In addition, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law, the Fund\nmay invest its assets in other funds advised\nby BlackRock, including funds that are managed\nby one or more of the same portfolio managers,\nwhich could result in conflicts of interest\nrelating to asset allocation, timing of Fund\npurchases and sales, and increased\nremuneration and profitability for BlackRock,\nand/or its personnel, including portfolio\nmanagers. In certain circumstances, BlackRock,\non behalf of the Fund, may seek to buy from or\nsell securities to another fund or account\nadvised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is\nnot required to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Fund, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Fund. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when the\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which the Fund\nhas invested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of\nthe Fund's investments\n\n64\n\nmay be negatively impacted by the activities\nof BlackRock or its clients, and transactions\nfor the Fund may be impaired or effected at\nprices or terms that may be less favorable\nthan would otherwise have been the case. The\nresults of the Fund\u2019s investment activities\nmay differ significantly from the results\nachieved by BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts or other accounts (including\ninvestment companies or collective investment\nvehicles) which it manages or advises. It is\npossible that one or more accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock and such other accounts\nwill achieve investment results that are\nsubstantially more or less favorable than the\nresults achieved by the Fund. Moreover, it is\npossible that the Fund will sustain losses\nduring periods in which one or more\nproprietary or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock achieve significant\nprofits. The opposite result is also possible.\nFrom time to time, the Fund may be restricted\nfrom purchasing or selling securities, or from\nengaging in other investment activities\nbecause of regulatory, legal or contractual\nrequirements applicable to BlackRock or other\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock,\nand/or the internal policies of BlackRock\ndesigned to comply with such requirements. As\na result, there may be periods, for example,\nwhen BlackRock will not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions in certain\nsecurities or instruments with respect to\nwhich BlackRock is performing services or when\nposition limits have been reached. For\nexample, the investment activities of\nBlackRock for its proprietary accounts and\naccounts under its management may limit the\ninvestment opportunities for the Fund in\ncertain emerging and other markets in which\nlimitations are imposed upon the amount of\ninvestment, in the aggregate or in individual\nissuers, by affiliated foreign investors. In\nconnection with its management of the Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on behalf of the Fund in\naccordance with such analysis and models. In\naddition, BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to make available any information\nregarding its proprietary activities or\nstrategies, or the activities or strategies\nused for other accounts managed by them, for\nthe benefit of the management of the Fund and\nit is not anticipated that BlackRock will have\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the\nactivities or strategies used for accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock or other client accounts\ncould conflict with the transactions and\nstrategies employed by BlackRock in managing\nthe Fund. The Fund may be included in\ninvestment models developed by BlackRock for\nuse by clients and financial advisors. To the\nextent clients invest in these investment\nmodels and increase the assets under\nmanagement of the Fund, the investment\nmanagement fee amounts paid by the Fund to\nBlackRock may also increase. The price,\navailability and liquidity of the Fund may be\nimpacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by\nmodel-driven investment portfolios, as well as\nby BlackRock itself and by its advisory\nclients. In addition, certain principals and\ncertain employees of the Fund\u2019s investment\nadviser are also principals or employees of\nother business units or entities within\nBlackRock. As a result, these principals and\nemployees may have obligations to such other\nbusiness units or entities or their clients\nand such obligations to other business units\nor entities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of the\nFund in which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by the Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which the Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non the Fund could potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthe Fund and increased assets under management\nfor BlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Fund or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may\n\n65\n\nfrom time to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. The Fund may,\nsubject to applicable law, purchase\ninvestments that are the subject of an\nunderwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse to those\nof the Fund. At times, these activities may\ncause business units or entities within\nBlackRock to give advice to clients that may\ncause these clients to take actions adverse to\nthe interests of the Fund. To the extent such\ntransactions are permitted, the Fund will deal\nwith BlackRock on an arm\u2019s-length basis. To\nthe extent authorized by applicable law,\nBlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent,\nlender or adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund. It is anticipated\nthat the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs,\nfinancial advisory fees, underwriting and\nplacement fees, sales fees, financing and\ncommitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees,\ncompensation or profits, rates, terms and\nconditions charged by BlackRock will be in its\nview commercially reasonable, although\nBlackRock, including its sales personnel, will\nhave an interest in obtaining fees and other\namounts that are favorable to BlackRock and\nsuch sales personnel, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. Index based funds\nmay use an index provider that is affiliated\nwith another service provider of the Fund or\nBlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer,\nagent, lender or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund or BlackRock. Subject\nto applicable law, BlackRock (and its\npersonnel and other distributors) will be\nentitled to retain fees and other amounts that\nthey receive in connection with their service\nto the Fund as broker, dealer, agent, lender,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities. No\naccounting to the Fund or its shareholders\nwill be required, and no fees or other\ncompensation payable by the Fund or its\nshareholders will be reduced by reason of\nreceipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other\namounts. When BlackRock acts as broker,\ndealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities in relation to the Fund, BlackRock\nmay take commercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund. The Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund's own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with the Fund's establishment of\nits business relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund's counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund's creditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFund. BlackRock will also receive compensation\nfor managing the reinvestment of the cash\ncollateral from securities lending. There are\npotential conflicts of interests in managing a\nsecurities lending program, including but not\nlimited to: (i) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to, among\nother things, increase or decrease the amount\nof securities on loan or to lend particular\nsecurities in order to generate additional\nrisk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its\naffiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to\nallocate loans to clients that would provide\nmore revenue to BlackRock. As described\nfurther below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate\nthis conflict by providing its securities\nlending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Fund and certain other clients\nand/or funds against a shortfall in collateral\nin the event of borrower default. On a regular\nbasis, BlackRock calculates the potential\ndollar exposure of collateral shortfall\nresulting from a borrower default ( \u201c\nshortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e., indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a\n\n66\n\nloan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the\nlending portfolio must also have enough\ninventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. BlackRock may decline to\nmake a securities loan on behalf of the Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of the Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of the\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for the Fund may\nbe bunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Fund will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Fund. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Fund will not\nbe charged the same commission or commission\nequivalent rates in connection with a bunched\nor aggregated order. Subject to applicable\nlaw, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish\nBlackRock, the Fund, other BlackRock client\naccounts or personnel, directly or through\ncorrespondent relationships, with research or\nother appropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Fund and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the Fund\nbased on the amount of brokerage commissions\npaid by the Fund and such other BlackRock\nclient accounts. For example, research or\nother services that are paid for through one\nclient's commissions may not be used in\nmanaging that client's account. In addition,\nother BlackRock client accounts may receive\nthe benefit, including disproportionate\nbenefits, of economies of scale or price\ndiscounts in connection with products and\nservices that may be provided to the Fund and\nto such other BlackRock client accounts. To\nthe extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars,\nit will not have to pay for those products and\nservices itself. BlackRock does not currently\nenter into arrangements to use the Fund's\nassets for, or participate in, soft dollars,\nalthough BlackRock may receive research that\nis bundled with the trade execution, clearing,\nand/or settlement services provided by a\nparticular broker-dealer. To the extent that\nBlackRock receives research on this basis,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. For\nexample, the research effectively will be paid\nby client commissions that also will be used\nto pay for the execution, clearing, and\nsettlement services provided by the broker-\ndealer and will not be paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable\nlaw, may endeavor to execute trades through\nbrokers who, pursuant to such arrangements,\nprovide research or other services in order to\nensure the continued receipt of research or\nother services BlackRock believes are useful\nin its investment decision-making process.\nBlackRock may from time to time choose not to\nengage in the above described arrangements to\nvarying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited\nby applicable law, may also enter into\ncommission sharing arrangements under which\nBlackRock may execute transactions through a\nbroker-dealer, and request that the broker-\ndealer allocate a portion of the commissions\nor commission credits to another firm that\nprovides research to BlackRock. To the extent\nthat BlackRock engages in commission sharing\narrangements, many of the same conflicts\nrelated to traditional soft dollars may exist.\n\n67\n\nBlackRock may utilize certain electronic\ncrossing networks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including,\nwithout limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock\nhas an investment or other interest, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law) in\nexecuting client securities transactions for\ncertain types of securities. These ECNs may\ncharge fees for their services, including\naccess fees and transaction fees. The\ntransaction fees, which are similar to\ncommissions or markups/markdowns, will\ngenerally be charged to clients and, like\ncommissions and markups/markdowns, would\ngenerally be included in the cost of the\nsecurities purchased. Access fees may be paid\nby BlackRock even though incurred in\nconnection with executing transactions on\nbehalf of clients, including the Fund. In\ncertain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume\ndiscounts that will reduce the access fees\ntypically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nonly utilize ECNs consistent with its\nobligation to seek to obtain best execution in\nclient transactions. BlackRock owns a minority\ninterest in, and is a member of, Members\nExchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly created U.S.\nstock exchange. Transactions for the Fund may\nbe executed on MEMX if third party brokers\nselect MEMX as the appropriate venue for\nexecution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of such Funds. In addition,\ntransactions in Fund shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the\nappropriate venue for the execution of such\norders. BlackRock has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent conflicts of\ninterest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Fund, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock's fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee the Proxy Voting Policy section of this\nSAI. It is also possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of\nthe Fund. Increasing the Fund\u2019s assets may\nenhance liquidity, investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the\nright, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw, to sell into the market or redeem in\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of the Fund acquired for its own\naccounts or the account of a BlackRock\nadvisory client. A large sale or redemption of\nshares of the Fund by BlackRock itself or a\nBlackRock advisory client could significantly\nreduce the asset size of the Fund, which might\nhave an adverse effect on the Fund's\nliquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio\ndiversification, expense ratio or ability to\ncomply with the listing requirements for the\nFund. It is possible that the Fund may invest\nin securities of, or engage in transactions\nwith, companies in which BlackRock has\nsignificant debt or equity investments or\nother interests. The Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured notes) by\nentities for which BlackRock provides and is\ncompensated for cash management services\nrelating to the proceeds from the sale of such\nissuances. In making investment decisions for\nthe Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain\nor use material non-public information\nacquired by any unit of BlackRock in the\ncourse of these activities. In addition, from\ntime to time, the activities of BlackRock may\nlimit the Fund's flexibility in purchases and\nsales of securities. As indicated below,\nBlackRock may engage in transactions with\ncompanies in which BlackRock-advised funds or\nother clients of BlackRock have an investment.\nBlackRock, its personnel and other financial\nservice providers may have interests in\npromoting sales of the Fund. With respect to\nBlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration\nand profitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Fund or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFund or its shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFund may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or the Fund, may\nsponsor events (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to the Fund.\n\n68\n\nBlackRock may provide valuation assistance to\ncertain clients with respect to certain\nsecurities or other investments and the\nvaluation recommendations made for such\nclients' accounts may differ from the\nvaluations for the same securities or\ninvestments assigned by the Fund's pricing\nvendors, especially if such valuations are\nbased on broker-dealer quotes or other data\nsources unavailable to the Fund's pricing\nvendors. While BlackRock will generally\ncommunicate its valuation information or\ndeterminations to the Fund's pricing vendors\nand/or fund accountants, there may be\ninstances where the Fund's pricing vendors or\nfund accountants assign a different valuation\nto a security or other investment than the\nvaluation for such security or investment\ndetermined or recommended by BlackRock. As\ndisclosed in more detail in the Determination\nof Net Asset Value section in this SAI, when\nmarket quotations are not readily available or\nare believed by BFA to be unreliable, the\nFund\u2019s investments are valued at fair value by\nBFA. BFA has been designated as the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under\nthe Investment Company Act and acts through\nBFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c 2a-5\nCommittee \u201d ), with assistance from other BFA\npricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that the Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BFA using proprietary or third-party\nvaluation models, fair value represents only a\ngood faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of one or\nmore assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, the Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, the Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in the Fund\nbearing some additional expenses. BlackRock\nand its directors, officers and employees, may\nbuy and sell securities or other investments\nfor their own accounts and may have conflicts\nof interest with respect to investments made\non behalf of the Fund. As a result of\ndiffering trading and investment strategies or\nconstraints, positions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees that are the\nsame, different from or made at different\ntimes than positions taken for the Fund. To\nlessen the possibility that the Fund will be\nadversely affected by this personal trading,\nthe Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted\na code of ethics in compliance with Section\n17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts\nsecurities trading in the personal accounts of\ninvestment professionals and others who\nnormally come into possession of information\nregarding the Fund's portfolio transactions.\nEach code of ethics is available by contacting\nBlackRock at the telephone number on the back\ncover of the Fund\u2019s Prospectus or by accessing\nthe EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site\nat http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\nthe Fund, except that the Fund may in\naccordance with rules or guidance adopted\nunder the 1940 Act engage in transactions with\nanother Fund or accounts that are affiliated\nwith the Fund as a result of common officers,\ndirectors, or investment advisers or pursuant\nto exemptive orders granted to the Fund and/or\nBlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would\nbe effected in circumstances in which\nBlackRock determined that it would be\nappropriate for the Fund to purchase and\nanother client of BlackRock to sell, or the\nFund to sell and another client of BlackRock\nto purchase, the same security or instrument\non the same day. From time to time, the\nactivities of the Fund may be restricted\nbecause of regulatory requirements applicable\nto BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal\npolicies designed to comply with, limit the\napplicability of, or otherwise relate to such\nrequirements. A client not advised by\nBlackRock would not be subject to some of\nthose considerations. There may be periods\nwhen BlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of the Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve\n\n69\n\nas directors of companies the securities of\nwhich the Fund wishes to purchase or sell.\nHowever, if permitted by applicable law, and\nwhere consistent with BlackRock\u2019s policies and\nprocedures (including the necessary\nimplementation of appropriate information\nbarriers), the Fund may purchase securities or\ninstruments that are issued by such companies,\nare the subject of an advisory or risk\nmanagement assignment by BlackRock, or where\npersonnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Fund. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Fund invests in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or is\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invests in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Fund) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Fund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or the Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Fund), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the Fund),\nmay limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Fund),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations. In addition to the\nforegoing, other ownership thresholds may\ntrigger reporting requirements to governmental\nand regulatory authorities, and such reports\nmay entail the disclosure of the identity of a\nclient or BlackRock\u2019s intended strategy with\nrespect to such security or asset. BlackRock\nmay not serve as an Authorized Participant in\nthe creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has\nretained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an Affiliate of\nBFA, to perform certain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant communications, and\nrelated services in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of Creation Units of\nthe Fund ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d ). BRIL will\nretain a portion of the standard transaction\nfee received from Authorized Participants on\neach creation or redemption order from the\nAuthorized Participant for the ETF Services\nprovided. BlackRock collaborated with, and\nreceived payment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c\nCitibank \u201d ) on the design and development of\nthe ETF Services platform. Citibank may have,\nor from time to time may develop, additional\nrelationships with BlackRock or funds managed\nby BFA and its affiliates. BlackRock may\nmaintain securities indices. To the extent\npermitted by applicable laws, the Fund may\nseek to license and use such indices as part\nof its investment strategy. Index based funds\nthat seek to track the performance of\nsecurities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Fund using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to the\nFund and the Fund is under no obligation to\nuse BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters\ninto a license for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\n\n70\n\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to the Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to the\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Fund,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to the Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to the Fund, or the\nselection of such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by the Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Fund, that engage the\nservice provider (typically the custodian).\nThe Fund\u2019s service provider remunerates\nBlackRock for the use of the systems. The Fund\nservice provider\u2019s payments to BlackRock for\nthe use of these systems may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock\u2019s\nreceipt of fees from a service provider in\nconnection with the use of systems provided by\nBlackRock may create an incentive for\nBlackRock to recommend that the Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider. In recognition of a BlackRock\nclient\u2019s overall relationship with BlackRock,\nBlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in the Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock (including BFA), its\ndirectors, officers and employees, in addition\nto those described in this section, may give\nrise to additional conflicts of interest.\nInvestment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services Investment Adviser. BFA\nserves as investment adviser to the Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, and\nBFA. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is\nregistered as an investment adviser under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nUnder the investment advisory agreement, BFA,\nsubject to the supervision of the Board and in\nconformity with the stated investment policies\nof the Fund, manages and administers the Trust\nand the investment of the Fund\u2019s assets. BFA\nis responsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the investment advisory agreement, BFA may,\nfrom time to time, in its sole discretion and\nto the extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to the Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. BFA is\nresponsible, under the investment advisory\nagreement, for substantially all expenses of\nthe Fund, including the cost of transfer\nagency, custody, fund administration, legal,\naudit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Fund will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of\n\n71\n\nportfolio securities and the execution of\nportfolio transactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or expenses,\nand litigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses (as determined by a majority of the\nIndependent Trustees).

As a consequence, from time to\ntime the Fund may receive a smaller allocation\nof an investment opportunity than it would\nhave if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its\naffiliates did not manage other portfolios or\naccounts. Like the Fund, the other portfolios\nor accounts for which the Portfolio Managers\nare primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management generally pay an asset-\nbased fee to BFA or its affiliates, as\napplicable, for its advisory services. One or\nmore of those other portfolios or accounts,\nhowever, may pay BFA or its affiliates a\nperformance-based fee in lieu of, or in\naddition to, an asset-based fee for its\nadvisory services. A portfolio or account with\na performance-based fee would pay BFA or its\naffiliates a portion of that portfolio\u2019s or\naccount\u2019s gains, or would pay BFA or its\naffiliates more for its services than would\notherwise be the case if BFA or any of its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Fund should be aware that,\nas with any group of portfolios and accounts\nmanaged by an investment adviser and/or its\naffiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below show, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of July 31, 2023:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts         Managed by  Total Assets   \n                    Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts         Managed by  Total Assets   \n                    Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts         Managed by  Total Assets   \n                    Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n                                              \n73\n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts         Managed by   Total Assets  \n                    Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Other                     1  $2,396,000,0\u2026  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of July 31, 2023.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance. As of July 31, 2023, the\nPortfolio Managers did not beneficially own\nshares of the Fund. Codes of Ethics.

Distributor. The\nDistributor's principal address is 50 Hudson\nYards, New York, NY 10001. Shares are\ncontinuously offered for sale by the Fund\nthrough the Distributor or its agent only in\nCreation Units, as described in the Prospectus\nand below in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI. Fund\nshares in amounts less than Creation Units are\ngenerally not distributed by the Distributor\nor its agent. The Distributor or its agent\nwill arrange for the delivery of the\nProspectus and, upon request, this SAI to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nor its agents and confirmations of acceptance\nfurnished by it or its agents. The Distributor\nis a broker-dealer registered under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.\n( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor is also\nlicensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S.\nstates, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands and the District of Columbia.\nThe Distribution Agreement for the Fund\nprovides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii)\nthe vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the Fund. The Distribution Agreement will\nterminate automatically in the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act). The\nDistributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers\n\u201d ) who will solicit purchases of Creation\nUnits of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers\nmay also be Authorized Participants (as\ndescribed below), Depository Trust Company ( \u201c\nDTC \u201d ) participants and/or investor services\norganizations. BFA or its affiliates may, from\ntime to time and from its own resources, pay,\ndefray or absorb costs relating to\ndistribution, including payments out of its\nown resources to the Distributor, or to\notherwise promote the sale of shares.\n\n75\n\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that the\nFund engages in securities lending, the Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund, subject\nto the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to\na written agreement (the \u201c Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement \u201d ). The Fund and Underlying\nFunds retain a portion of the securities\nlending income and remits the remaining\nportion to BTC as compensation for its\nservices as securities lending agent.\nSecurities lending income is generally equal\nto the total of income earned from the\nreinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes\ncollateral investment fees as defined below),\nand any fees or other payments to and from\nborrowers of securities. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. The\nFund and Underlying Funds are responsible for\nfees in connection with the investment of cash\ncollateral received for securities on loan in\na money market fund managed by BFA (the \u201c\ncollateral investment fees \u201d ); however, BTC\nhas agreed to reduce the amount of securities\nlending income it receives in order to\neffectively limit the collateral investment\nfees the Fund bears to an annual rate of\n0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not\nbe subject to a sales load, redemption fee,\ndistribution fee or service fee. Under the\nsecurities lending program, the Fund is\ncategorized into one of several specific asset\nclasses. The determination of the Fund\u2019s asset\nclass category (fixed-income, domestic equity,\ninternational equity or fund-of-funds), each\nof which may be subject to a different fee\narrangement, is based on a methodology agreed\nto by the Trust and BTC. Pursuant to the\ncurrent Securities Lending Agency Agreement:\n(i) fund-of-funds, such as the Fund, retain\n82% of securities lending income (which\nexcludes collateral investment fees), and (ii)\nthis amount can never be less than 70% of the\nsum of securities lending income plus\ncollateral investment fees. In addition,\ncommencing the business day following the date\nthat the aggregate securities lending income\n(which includes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex (as defined in the\nManagement \u2014 Trustees and Officers section of\nthis SAI) in a calendar year exceeds a\nspecified threshold, each applicable fund-of-\nfunds, pursuant to the current Securities\nLending Agency Agreement, will receive for the\nremainder of that calendar year securities\nlending income as follows: (i) 85% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees) and (ii) this\namount can never be less than 70% of the sum\nof securities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees. The services provided to the\nFund by BTC in the most recent fiscal year\nended July 31, 2023 primarily included the\nfollowing: (1) selecting borrowers from an\napproved list of borrowers and executing a\nsecurities lending agreement as agent on\nbehalf of the Fund with each such borrower;\n(2) negotiating the terms of securities loans,\nincluding the amount of fees; (3) directing\nthe delivery of loaned securities; (4)\nmonitoring the daily value of the loaned\nsecurities and directing the payment of\nadditional collateral or the return of excess\ncollateral, as necessary; (5) investing cash\ncollateral received in connection with any\nloaned securities; (6) monitoring\ndistributions on loaned securities (for\nexample, interest and dividend activity); (7)\nin the event of default by a borrower with\nrespect to any securities loan, using the\ncollateral or the proceeds of the liquidation\nof collateral to purchase replacement\nsecurities of the same issue, type, class and\nseries as that of the loaned securities; and\n(8) terminating securities loans and arranging\nfor the return of loaned securities to the\nFund at loan termination.

BFA and/or\nits affiliates ( \u201c BFA Entities \u201d ) may pay\ncertain broker-dealers, registered investment\nadvisers, banks and other financial\nintermediaries ( \u201c Intermediaries \u201d ) for\ncertain activities related to the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products in\ngeneral. BFA Entities make these payments from\ntheir own assets and not from the assets of\nthe Fund. Although a portion of BFA Entities\u2019\nrevenue comes directly or indirectly in part\nfrom fees paid by the Fund, other iShares\nfunds (including, if applicable, any\nunderlying iShares funds held by a Fund) or\nexchange-traded products, these payments do\nnot increase the price paid by investors for\nthe purchase of shares of, or the cost of\nowning, the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products. BFA Entities make\npayments for Intermediaries\u2019 participation in\nactivities that are designed to make\nregistered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Fund and other iShares funds, or\nfor other activities, such as\n\n77\n\nparticipation in marketing activities and\npresentations, educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems ( \u201c Education\nCosts \u201d ). BFA Entities also make payments to\nIntermediaries for certain printing,\npublishing and mailing costs or materials\nrelating to the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products ( \u201c Publishing Costs\n\u201d ). In addition, BFA Entities make payments\nto Intermediaries that make shares of the\nFund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded\nproducts available to their clients, in some\ncases at a waived or reduced commission rate\nor ticket charge, develop new products that\nfeature iShares, create educational content\nabout the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products that is featured on\nan Intermediary\u2019s platform, or otherwise\npromote the Fund, other iShares funds and\nexchange-traded products. BFA Entities may\nalso reimburse expenses or make payments from\ntheir own assets to Intermediaries or other\npersons in consideration of services or other\nactivities that the BFA Entities believe may\nbenefit the iShares business or facilitate\ninvestment in the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products. Payments of the type\ndescribed above are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products, or otherwise promote\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm. In addition to\nthe payments described above, BFA Entities\nhave developed proprietary tools, calculators\nand related interactive or digital content\nthat is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Fund, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream\nFund Centre AG, Commonwealth Equity Services,\nLLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC,\nE*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset\nManagement, Inc., eToro USA Securities Inc.,\nLPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\nFenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley\nSmith Barney LLC, Northwestern Mutual\nInvestment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio\nSolutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public Holdings,\nInc., Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.,\nRiskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary Wealth Group, LLC,\nStash Investments LLC, TD Ameritrade, Inc.,\nUBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo\nClearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo\nAdvisors Financial\n\n78\n\nNetwork, LLC. Any additions, modifications, or\ndeletions to Intermediaries and other third\nparties listed above that have occurred since\nthe date of this SAI are not included in the\nlist. Further, BFA Entities make Education\nCosts and Publishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFund, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Fund, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Fund may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Fund would pay a fee\nto the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of the Fund to enhance the\nliquidity and quality of the secondary market\nof securities of the Fund. The fee would then\nbe credited by the exchange to one or more\nmarket makers that meet or exceed liquidity\nand market quality standards with respect to\nthe securities of the Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of the\nFund solely for the benefit of the Fund and\nwill not be paid from any Fund assets. Other\nfunds managed by BFA may also participate in\nsuch programs. Determination of Net Asset\nValue Valuation of Shares. The NAV for the\nFund is generally calculated as of the close\nof regular trading hours on the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is\nopen. Valuation of assets held by the Fund is\nas follows: Equity Investments. Equity\nsecurities traded on a recognized securities\nexchange ( e.g. , NYSE), on separate trading\nboards of a securities exchange or through a\nmarket system that provides contemporaneous\ntransaction pricing information (each an \u201c\nExchange \u201d ) are valued using information\nobtained via independent pricing services,\ngenerally at the closing price or, if an\nExchange closing price is not available, the\nlast traded price on that Exchange prior to\nthe time as of which the assets or liabilities\nare valued. However, under certain\ncircumstances, other means of determining\ncurrent market value may be used. If an equity\nsecurity is traded on more than one Exchange,\nthe current market value of the security where\nit is primarily traded generally will be used.\nIn the event that there are no sales involving\nan equity security held by the Fund on a day\non which the Fund values such security, the\nprior day\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the\nsecurity, in which case such asset would be\ntreated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined\nbelow). Options, Futures, Swaps and Other\nDerivatives. Exchange-traded equity options\n(except those that are customized) for which\nmarket quotations are readily available are\nvalued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by the Fund on a day on which the Fund\nvalues such option, the last bid (long\npositions) or ask (short positions) price, if\navailable, will be used as the value of such\noption. If no bid or ask price is available on\na day on which the Fund values such option,\nthe prior day\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price.\n\n79\n\nGeneral Valuation Information. Prices obtained\nfrom independent third-party pricing services,\nbroker-dealers or market makers to value the\nFund\u2019s securities and other assets and\nliabilities are based on information available\nat the time the Fund values its assets and\nliabilities. In the event that a pricing\nservice quotation is revised or updated\nsubsequent to the day on which the Fund valued\nsuch security, the revised pricing service\nquotation generally will be applied\nprospectively. Such determination will be made\nconsidering pertinent facts and circumstances\nsurrounding the revision. The price the Fund\ncould receive upon the sale of any particular\nportfolio investment may differ from the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for assets that trade in thin or\nvolatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation methodology or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. As a\nresult, the price received upon the sale of an\ninvestment may be less than the value ascribed\nby the Fund, and the Fund could realize a\ngreater than expected loss or lesser than\nexpected gain upon the sale of the investment.\nThe Fund\u2019s ability to value its investment may\nalso be impacted by technological issues\nand/or errors by pricing services or other\nthird-party service providers. All cash,\nreceivables and current payables are carried\non the Fund\u2019s books at their fair value. In\nthe event that application of the methods of\nvaluation discussed above result in a price\nfor a security which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, the Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by the Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. Use of\nfair value prices and certain current market\nvaluations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate the\nFund\u2019s NAV and the prices used in the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn, could result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the Underlying Index.\nFair Value. When market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.\nOn any day the NYSE is open and a foreign\nmarket or the primary exchange on which a\nforeign asset or liability is traded is\nclosed, such asset or liability will be valued\nusing the prior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA\nis not aware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition,\nthe Fund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of the Fund. The pricing of all\nFair Value Assets is subsequently reported to\nthe Board or a committee thereof. When\ndetermining the price for a Fair Value Asset,\nBFA will seek to determine the price that the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive from\nthe current sale of that asset or liability in\nan arm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on\nwhich the asset or liability is being valued,\nand does not seek to determine the price the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive for\nselling an asset or liability at a later time\nor if it holds the asset or liability to\nmaturity. Fair value determinations will be\nbased upon all available factors that BFA\ndeems relevant at the time of the\ndetermination, and may be based on analytical\nvalues determined by BFA using proprietary or\nthird-party valuation models.\n\n80\n\nFair value represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. When determining the fair value of\nan investment, one or more fair value\nmethodologies may be used (depending on\ncertain factors, including the asset type).\nFor example, the investment may be initially\npriced based on the original cost of the\ninvestment or, alternatively, using\nproprietary or third-party models that may\nrely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nThe Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect\nthe Fund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to the Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Fund,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, the Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including the\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause the Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for the Fund and may take into\naccount a variety of factors including: (i)\nthe size, nature and character of the security\nor instrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions.\n\n81\n\nFrom time to time, the Fund may purchase new\nissues of securities in a fixed price\noffering. In these situations, the broker may\nbe a member of the selling group that will, in\naddition to selling securities, provide BFA\nwith research services. FINRA has adopted\nrules expressly permitting these types of\narrangements under certain circumstances.\nGenerally, the broker will provide research \u201c\ncredits \u201d in these situations at a rate that\nis higher than that available for typical\nsecondary market transactions. These\narrangements may not fall within the safe\nharbor of Section 28(e). The Fund anticipates\nthat brokerage transactions involving foreign\nequity securities generally will be conducted\nprimarily on the principal stock exchanges of\nthe applicable country. Foreign equity\nsecurities may be held by the Fund in the form\nof depositary receipts, or other securities\nconvertible into foreign equity securities.\nDepositary receipts may be listed on stock\nexchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the\nU.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like\nother securities traded in the U.S., will be\nsubject to negotiated commission rates. OTC\nissues, including most fixed-income securities\nsuch as corporate debt and U.S. Government\nsecurities, are normally traded on a \u201c net \u201d\nbasis without a stated commission, through\ndealers acting for their own account and not\nas brokers. The Fund will primarily engage in\ntransactions with these dealers or deal\ndirectly with the issuer unless a better price\nor execution could be obtained by using a\nbroker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit. Under the 1940\nAct, persons affiliated with the Fund and\npersons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the dealers\nacting as principal for their own accounts,\nthe Fund will not deal with affiliated persons\nand affiliated persons of such affiliated\npersons in connection with such transactions.\nThe Fund will not purchase securities during\nthe existence of any underwriting or selling\ngroup relating to such securities of which\nBFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined\nin the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except\npursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in\naccordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.\nPurchases of money market instruments by the\nFund are made from dealers, underwriters and\nissuers. The Fund does not currently expect to\nincur any brokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Fund\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Fund may invest.\n\n82\n\nInitial public offerings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of\nsecurities may be over-subscribed and\nsubsequently trade at a premium in the\nsecondary market. When BFA is given an\nopportunity to invest in such an initial\noffering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue, the\nsupply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in the Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well. Because different\naccounts may have differing investment\nobjectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell\nthe same securities at the same time for\ndifferent clients based on the particular\ninvestment objective, guidelines and\nstrategies of those accounts. For example, BFA\nmay decide that it may be entirely appropriate\nfor a growth fund to sell a security at the\nsame time a value fund is buying that\nsecurity. To the extent that transactions on\nbehalf of more than one client of BFA or the\nother Affiliates during the same period\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, there may be an adverse effect on price.\nFor example, sales of a security by BlackRock\non behalf of one or more of its clients may\ndecrease the market price of such security,\nadversely impacting other BlackRock clients\nthat still hold the security. If purchases or\nsales of securities arise for consideration at\nor about the same time that would involve the\nFund or other clients or funds for which BFA\nor another Affiliate act as investment\nmanager, transactions in such securities will\nbe made, insofar as feasible, for the\nrespective funds and clients in a manner\ndeemed equitable to all. In certain instances,\nBFA may find it efficient for purposes of\nseeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate\nor \u201c bunch \u201d certain contemporaneous purchases\nor sale orders of its advisory accounts and\nadvisory accounts of affiliates. In general,\nall contemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Fund are concerned,\nin other cases it could be beneficial to the\nFund. Transactions effected by BFA or the\nother Affiliates on behalf of more than one of\nits clients during the same period may\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, causing an adverse effect on price. The\ntrader will give the bunched order to the\nbroker-dealer that the trader has identified\nas being able to provide the best execution of\nthe order. Orders for purchase or sale of\nsecurities will be placed within a reasonable\namount of time of the order receipt and\nbunched orders will be kept bunched only long\nenough to execute the order. The table below\nsets forth the brokerage commissions paid by\nthe Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any\ndifferences in brokerage commissions paid by\nthe Fund from year to year are principally due\nto increases or decreases in the Fund\u2019s assets\nover those periods or the magnitude of changes\nto the components of a Fund's Underlying\nIndex:\n                                              \n                   Broker\u2026  Broker\u2026  Broker\u2026  \n                   During\u2026  During\u2026  During\u2026  \n                   YearEn\u2026  YearEn\u2026  YearEn\u2026  \n                      July     July     July  \n                       31,      31,      31,  \n  Fund    FundIn\u2026     2023     2022     2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  iShar\u2026                                      \n  Morni\u2026                                      \n  Multi\u2026  04/03/\u2026  $31,552  $35,785  $71,580  \n  Income                                      \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \n83\n\nThe Fund did not pay any brokerage commissions\nto BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, or to any other\nbroker-dealer that is part of the BlackRock\ngroup of companies, during the fiscal year\nended July 31, 2023. The Fund's purchase and\nsale orders for securities may be combined\nwith those of other investment companies,\nclients or accounts that BlackRock manages or\nadvises. If purchases or sales of portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund and one or more other\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock are\nconsidered at or about the same time,\ntransactions in such securities are allocated\namong the Fund and the other accounts in a\nmanner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock.\nIn some cases, this procedure could have a\ndetrimental effect on the price or volume of\nthe security as far as the Fund is concerned.\nHowever, in other cases, it is possible that\nthe ability to participate in volume\ntransactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFund. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for\nits own account in the types of securities in\nwhich the Fund may invest. BlackRock may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Fund\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses.

Absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more\nthan 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject\nto the reporting provisions of Section 13 of\nthe 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould\n\n84\n\nconsult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff. In accordance with\nthe Trust's current Agreement and Declaration\nof Trust (the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the\nBoard may, without shareholder approval\n(unless such shareholder approval is required\nby the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Fund. Shares of\nthe Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of the\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements. Share distributions shall be\nmade to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all shares of the Trust.\nDTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any\n\n85\n\nrecords relating to such beneficial ownership\ninterests, or for any other aspect of the\nrelationship between DTC and the DTC\nParticipants or the relationship between such\nDTC Participants and the Indirect Participants\nand Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC\nParticipants. DTC may decide to discontinue\nproviding its service with respect to shares\nof the Trust at any time by giving reasonable\nnotice to the Trust and discharging its\nresponsibilities with respect thereto under\napplicable law. Under such circumstances, the\nTrust shall take action to find a replacement\nfor DTC to perform its functions at a\ncomparable cost. Distribution of Shares. In\nconnection with the Fund's launch, the Fund\nwas seeded through the sale of one or more\nCreation Units by the Fund to one or more\ninitial investors. Initial investors\nparticipating in the seeding may be Authorized\nParticipants, a lead market maker or other\nthird party investor or an affiliate of the\nFund or the Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such initial\ninvestor may sell some or all of the shares\nunderlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them\npursuant to the registration statement for the\nFund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d ), which\nshares have been registered to permit the\nresale from time to time after purchase. The\nFund will not receive any of the proceeds from\nthe resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\nthe Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund's NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the Listing Exchange closes earlier\nthan normal, the Fund may require orders to be\nplaced earlier in the day. The following table\nsets forth the number of shares of the Fund\nthat constitute a Creation Unit for the Fund\nand the approximate value of such Creation\nUnit as of August 31, 2023:\n                                              \n                       Shares  ApproximateV\u2026  \n  Fund            PerCreation  PerCreationU\u2026  \n                         Unit        (U.S.$)  \n  iShares                                     \n  Morningstar                                 \n  Multi-Asset          50,000    $984,769.25  \n  Income                                      \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of\nthe Fund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation\nUnit. The Board reserves the right to declare\na split or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of the Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board. A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\nthe Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. The Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\nthe Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay.\n\n86\n\nFund Deposit. The consideration for purchase\nof Creation Units of the Fund generally\nconsists of Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent computed as described below.\nTogether, the Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent constitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d\nwhich, when combined with the Fund's portfolio\nsecurities, is designed to generate\nperformance that has a collective investment\nprofile similar to that of the Underlying\nIndex. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum\ninitial and subsequent investment amount for a\nCreation Unit of the Fund. Such Fund Deposit\nis applicable, subject to any adjustments as\ndescribed below, to purchases of Creation\nUnits of shares of the Fund until such time as\nthe next-announced Fund Deposit is made\navailable. The Cash Component is an amount\nequal to the difference between the NAV of the\nshares (per Creation Unit) and the \u201c Deposit\nAmount, \u201d which is an amount equal to the\nmarket value of the Deposit Securities, and\nserves to compensate for any differences\nbetween the NAV per Creation Unit and the\nDeposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities are the sole responsibility\nof the Authorized Participant purchasing the\nCreation Unit. The identity and number or par\nvalue of the Deposit Securities change\npursuant to changes in the composition of the\nFund's portfolio and as rebalancing\nadjustments and corporate action events are\nreflected from time to time by BFA with a view\nto the investment objective of the Fund. The\ncomposition of the Deposit Securities may also\nchange in response to adjustments to the\nweighting or composition of the component\nsecurities constituting the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund Deposit may also be modified to\nminimize the Cash Component by redistributing\nthe cash to the Deposit Securities portion of\nthe Fund Deposit through \u201c systematic\nrounding. \u201d The rounding methodology \u201c rounds\nup \u201d position sizes of securities in the\nDeposit Securities (which in turn reduces the\ncash portion). However, the methodology limits\nthe maximum allowed percentage change in\nweight and share quantity of any given\nsecurity in the Fund Deposit. Fund Deposits\nmay also be modified to position a fund\ntowards a forward index rebalance to reflect\nrevisions that account for index additions,\ndeletions, and re-weights. The Trust may, in\nits sole discretion, substitute a \u201c cash in\nlieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash\nComponent to replace any Deposit Security in\ncertain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by the Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit partial or full cash purchases of\nCreation Units of its funds, when partial or\nfull cash purchases of Creation Units are\navailable or specified for the Fund, they will\nbe effected in essentially the same manner as\nin-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a\npartial or full cash purchase, the Authorized\nParticipant must pay the cash equivalent of\nthe Deposit Securities it would otherwise be\nrequired to provide through an in-kind\npurchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Fund, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units is referred to as an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant. \u201d All shares of the\nFund, however created, will be entered on the\nrecords of DTC in the name of Cede & Co. for\nthe account of a DTC Participant. Role of the\nAuthorized Participant. Creation Units may be\npurchased only by or through a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units (an \u201c Authorized Participant\n\u201d ). Such Authorized Participant will agree,\npursuant to the terms of such Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and on behalf of itself\nor any investor on whose behalf it will act,\nto certain conditions, including that such\nAuthorized Participant will make available in\nadvance of each purchase of shares an amount\nof cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component,\nonce the\n\n87\n\nNAV of a Creation Unit is next determined\nafter receipt of the purchase order in proper\nform, together with the transaction fees\ndescribed below. An Authorized Participant,\nacting on behalf of an investor, may require\nthe investor to enter into an agreement with\nsuch Authorized Participant with respect to\ncertain matters, including payment of the Cash\nComponent. Investors who are not Authorized\nParticipants must make appropriate\narrangements with an Authorized Participant.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not be a DTC Participant\nor may not have executed an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and that orders to\npurchase Creation Units may have to be placed\nby the investor's broker through an Authorized\nParticipant. As a result, purchase orders\nplaced through an Authorized Participant may\nresult in additional charges to such investor.\nThe Trust does not expect to enter into an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement with more\nthan a small number of DTC Participants. A\nlist of current Authorized Participants may be\nobtained from the Distributor. The Distributor\nhas adopted guidelines regarding Authorized\nParticipants\u2019 transactions in Creation Units\nthat are made available to all Authorized\nParticipants. These guidelines set forth the\nprocesses and standards for Authorized\nParticipants to transact with the Distributor\nand its agents in connection with creation and\nredemption transactions. In addition, the\nDistributor may be appointed as the proxy of\nthe Authorized Participant and may be granted\na power of attorney under its Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Purchase Orders. To\ninitiate an order for a Creation Unit, an\nAuthorized Participant must submit to the\nDistributor or its agent an irrevocable order\nto purchase shares of the Fund, in proper\nform, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day to receive that day\u2019s NAV.\nThe Distributor or its agent will notify BFA\nand the custodian of such order. The custodian\nwill then provide such information to any\nappropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and\nrequirements governing the delivery of the\nFund Deposit are set forth in the procedures\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Investors, other\nthan Authorized Participants, are responsible\nfor making arrangements for a creation request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFund, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Fund to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\ndeadline for cash transfers by contacting the\noperations department of the broker or\ndepositary institution effectuating the\ntransfer of the Cash Component. This deadline\nis likely to be significantly earlier than the\nCutoff Time of the Fund. Investors should be\naware that an Authorized Participant may\nrequire orders for purchases of shares placed\nwith it to be in the particular form required\nby the individual Authorized Participant. The\nAuthorized Participant is responsible for any\nand all expenses and costs incurred by the\nFund, including any applicable cash amounts,\nin connection with any purchase order. Timing\nof Submission of Purchase Orders. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable order to purchase shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Fund to the Distributor or its\nagent pursuant to procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Economic or\nmarket disruptions or changes, or telephone or\nother communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. Orders to create\nshares of the Fund that are submitted on the\nBusiness Day immediately preceding a holiday\nor a day (other than a weekend) when the\nequity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market\nare closed may not be accepted. The Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as the Fund's \u201c\nCutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with the\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Fund are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFund will accept the order, subject to the\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below.\n\n88\n\nOnce the Fund has accepted an order, upon the\nnext determination of the NAV of the shares,\nthe Fund will confirm the issuance of a\nCreation Unit, against receipt of payment, at\nsuch NAV. The Distributor or its agent will\nthen transmit a confirmation of acceptance to\nthe Authorized Participant that placed the\norder. The Fund reserves the right to reject\nor revoke a creation order transmitted to it\nby the Distributor or its agent provided that\na rejection or revocation of a creation order\ndoes not violate Rule 6c-11 under the\nInvestment Company Act. For example, the Fund\nmay reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent if (i) the order is not in proper form;\n(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the\nshares ordered, would own 80% or more of the\ncurrently outstanding shares of the Fund;\n(iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not\nconform to the identity and number of shares\nspecified, as described above; (iv) acceptance\nof the Deposit Securities is not legally\nrequired or would, in the opinion of counsel,\nbe unlawful; or (v) circumstances outside the\ncontrol of the Fund, the Distributor or its\nagent and BFA make it impracticable to process\npurchase orders. The Distributor or its agent\nshall notify a prospective purchaser of a\nCreation Unit and/or the Authorized\nParticipant acting on behalf of such purchaser\nof its rejection of such order. The Fund,\nCitibank, the sub-custodian and the\nDistributor or its agent are under no duty,\nhowever, to give notification of any defects\nor irregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall any of them incur any\nliability for failure to give such\nnotification. Issuance of a Creation Unit.\nExcept as provided herein, a Creation Unit\nwill not be issued until the transfer of good\ntitle to the Fund of the Deposit Securities\nand the payment of the Cash Component have\nbeen completed. When the sub-custodian has\nconfirmed to the custodian that the securities\nincluded in the Fund Deposit (or the cash\nvalue thereof) have been delivered to the\naccount of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-\ncustodians, the Distributor or its agent and\nBFA shall be notified of such delivery and the\nFund will issue and cause the delivery of the\nCreation Unit. Creation Units are generally\nissued on a \u201c T+1 basis \u201d ( i.e. , one\nBusiness Day after trade date). The Fund\nreserves the right to settle Creation Unit\ntransactions on a basis other than T+1,\nincluding a shorter settlement period, if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. To the extent contemplated by an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement with the\nDistributor, the Fund will issue Creation\nUnits to such Authorized Participant,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the\ncorresponding Fund Deposits have not been\nreceived in part or in whole, in reliance on\nthe undertaking of the Authorized Participant\nto deliver the missing Deposit Securities as\nsoon as possible, which undertaking shall be\nsecured by such Authorized Participant's\ndelivery and maintenance of collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to buy Deposit\nSecurities for the Fund. Such collateral must\nbe delivered no later than the time specified\nby the Fund or its custodian on the\ncontractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Fund's current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Fund to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Fund of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges. In certain cases,\nAuthorized Participants may create and redeem\nCreation Units on the same trade date and in\nthese instances, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by the\nFund and the Fund's determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the\nFund has retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA,\nto perform ETF Services. BRIL will receive\nfrom an Authorized Participant a standard\ntransaction fee on each creation order, which\nconsists of (1) a fee for providing the ETF\nServices (the \u201c ETF Servicing Fee \u201d ) and (2)\ntransfer, processing and other transaction\ncosts charged by the Fund custodian in\nconnection with the issuance of Creation Units\nfor such creation order ( \u201c Custody\nTransaction Costs \u201d ). BRIL is entitled to\nretain the ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the\nETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will\nreimburse any Custody Transaction Costs to the\nFund custodian according to the amounts\ninvoiced by such custodian. The ETF Servicing\nFee is a flat fee per order regardless of the\nnumber of Creation Units being purchased,\nwhich amount will vary among different Funds\nbased on a number of factors, including the\ncomplexity of the order and the types of\nsecurities or instruments included in a Fund\u2019s\nCreation Basket, among other variables. The\nactual Custody Transaction Costs vary per\norder based on the number of trades,\nunderlying markets and settlement locations\nassociated with the issuance of a Creation\n\n89\n\nUnit. The following table sets forth, either\nthe actual creation transaction fee that was\ncharged on October 31, 2023 or an estimate of\nthe creation transaction fee that would have\nbeen charged if the Fund had issued a Creation\nUnit on that date. The actual fee that was or\nwould have been charged to an Authorized\nParticipant in connection with a creation\norder will vary over time depending on the\nfactors discussed above, and may be higher\nthan the fee set forth below. If a purchase\nconsists solely or partially of cash, the\nAuthorized Participant may also be required to\ncover (up to the maximum amount shown below)\ncertain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange,\nexecution, price movement and other costs and\nexpenses related to the execution of trades\nresulting from such transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs). Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Deposit Securities to the\nFund. Certain fees/costs associated with\ncreation transactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\nacquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for\nsuch services. The following table sets forth\nthe Fund's actual or estimated creation\ntransaction fee, as applicable, as of October\n31, 2023 and maximum additional charge (as\ndescribed above):\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  CreationTransaction   AdditionalCharge*     \n  Fee                                         \n  $161.25**             3.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit. ** Estimated fee. Redemption of\nCreation Units. Shares of the Fund may be\nredeemed by Authorized Participants only in\nCreation Units at their NAV next determined\nafter receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form by the Distributor or its agent\nand only on a Business Day. The Fund will not\nredeem shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits. There can be no assurance, however,\nthat there will be sufficient liquidity in the\nsecondary market at any time to permit\nassembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should\nexpect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number\nof shares to constitute a Creation Unit that\ncould be redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant. Beneficial owners also may sell\nshares in the secondary market. The Fund\ngenerally redeems Creation Units for Fund\nSecurities (as defined below). Please see the\nCash Redemption Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the in-kind\nmethod for further information on redeeming\nCreation Units of the Fund. The Fund publishes\nthe designated portfolio of securities\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) that will be\napplicable to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day ( \u201c\nFund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption Basket \u201d ),\nand an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash Amount, \u201d as\ndescribed below) in order to effect\nredemptions of Creation Units of the Fund.\nSuch Fund Securities and Cash Amount will\nremain in effect until such time as the next\nannounced composition of the Fund Securities\nand Cash Amount is made available. The Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount are subject to\npossible amendment or correction. Fund\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Unless cash\nredemptions are available or specified for the\nFund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit generally consist of Fund Securities,\nplus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal\nto the difference between the NAV of the\nshares being redeemed, as next determined\nafter the receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form, and the value of Fund Securities,\nless a redemption transaction fee (as\ndescribed below). The Trust may, in its sole\ndiscretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of\n\n90\n\ncash paid out in such cases will be equivalent\nto the value of the substituted security\nlisted as a Fund Security. In the event that\nthe Fund Securities have a value greater than\nthe NAV of the shares, a compensating cash\npayment equal to the difference is required to\nbe made by or through an Authorized\nParticipant by the redeeming shareholder. The\nFund generally redeems Creation Units for Fund\nSecurities, but the Fund reserves the right to\nutilize a cash option for redemption of\nCreation Units. The Fund may, in its sole\ndiscretion, provide such redeeming Authorized\nParticipant a portfolio of securities that\ndiffers from the exact composition of the Fund\nSecurities, but does not differ in NAV. The\nRedemption Basket may also be modified to\nminimize the Cash Component by redistributing\nthe cash to the Fund Securities portion of the\nRedemption Basket through\nsystematically rounding. The rounding\nmethodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index rebalance to reflect revisions\nthat account for index additions, deletions,\nand re-weights. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\npartial or full cash redemptions of Creation\nUnits of its funds, when partial or full cash\nredemptions of Creation Units are available or\nspecified for the Fund, they will be effected\nin essentially the same manner as in-kind\nredemptions thereof. In the case of partial or\nfull cash redemption, the Authorized\nParticipant receives the cash equivalent of\nthe Fund Securities it would otherwise receive\nthrough an in-kind redemption, plus the same\nCash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\nA standard redemption transaction fee is\nimposed to offset transfer and other\ntransaction costs that may be incurred by the\nFund. As described above, under an ETF\nServices Agreement, the Fund has retained\nBRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform certain\nETF Services. BRIL will receive from an\nAuthorized Participant a standard transaction\nfee on each redemption order, which consists\nof (1) the ETF Servicing Fee and (2) Custody\nTransaction Costs. BRIL is entitled to retain\nthe ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF\nServices Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse\nany Custody Transaction Costs to the Fund\ncustodian according to the amounts invoiced by\nsuch custodian. The ETF Servicing Fee is a\nflat fee per order regardless of the number of\nCreation Units being redeemed, which amount\nwill vary among different Funds based on a\nnumber of factors, including the complexity of\nthe order and the types of securities or\ninstruments included in a Fund\u2019s Redemption\nBasket, among other variables. The actual\nCustody Transaction Costs vary per order based\non the number of trades, underlying markets,\nand settlement locations associated with the\nredemption of a Creation Unit. The following\ntable sets forth either the actual standard\nredemption transaction fee that was charged on\nOctober 31, 2023 or an estimate of the\nstandard redemption transaction fee that would\nhave been charged if the Fund had redeemed a\nCreation Unit on that date. The actual fee\nthat was or would have been charged to an\nAuthorized Participant in connection with a\ncreation order will vary over time depending\non the factors discussed above, and may be\nhigher than the fee set forth below. If a\nredemption consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution, price movement and other\ncosts and expenses related to the execution of\ntrades resulting from such transaction (which\nmay, in certain instances, be based on a good\nfaith estimate of transaction costs).\nAuthorized Participants will also bear the\ncosts of transferring the Fund Securities from\nthe Fund to their account on their order.\nCertain fees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\ndispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee\nfor such services. The following table sets\nforth the Fund's actual or estimated\nredemption transaction fee, as applicable, as\nof October 31, 2023 and maximum additional\ncharge (as described above):\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  RedemptionTransacti\u2026  AdditionalCharge*     \n  Fee                                         \n  $161.25**             2.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\nredemption transaction fee. ** Estimated fee.\n\n91\n\nPlacement of Redemption Orders. Redemption\nrequests for Creation Units of the Fund must\nbe submitted to the Distributor or its agent\nby or through an Authorized Participant. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable request to redeem shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, the Fund may\nrequire orders to redeem Creation Units to be\nplaced earlier that day. Investors, other than\nAuthorized Participants, are responsible for\nmaking arrangements for a redemption request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. The Authorized Participant must\ntransmit the request for redemption in the\nform required by the Fund to the Distributor\nor its agent in accordance with procedures set\nforth in the Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that,\ntherefore, requests to redeem Creation Units\nmay have to be placed by the investor's broker\nthrough an Authorized Participant who has\nexecuted an Authorized Participant Agreement.\nAt any time, only a limited number of broker-\ndealers will have an Authorized Participant\nAgreement in effect. Investors making a\nredemption request should be aware that such\nrequest must be in the form specified by such\nAuthorized Participant. Investors making a\nrequest to redeem Creation Units should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe request by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Fund's transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Fund's\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the Fund is\nreceived by the Distributor or its agent from\nthe Authorized Participant on behalf of itself\nor another redeeming investor within the time\nperiods specified above; and (iii) all other\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement are properly followed.\nUpon receiving a redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent shall notify the Fund\nand the Fund's transfer agent of such\nredemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds by the Fund are generally made within\none Business Day ( i.e. , \u201c T+1 \u201d ). The Fund\nreserves the right to settle redemption\ntransactions on a basis other than T+1 if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. If a Fund includes a foreign investment\nin its basket, and if a local market holiday,\nor series of consecutive holidays, or the\nextended delivery cycles for transferring\nforeign investments to redeeming Authorized\nParticipants prevents timely delivery of the\nforeign investment in response to a redemption\nrequest, a Fund may delay delivery of the\nforeign investment more than seven days if a\nFund delivers the foreign investment as soon\nas practicable, but in no event later than 15\ndays. To the extent contemplated by an\nAuthorized Participant\u2019s agreement with the\nDistributor or its agent, in the event an\nAuthorized Participant has submitted a\nredemption request in proper form but is\nunable to transfer all or part of the Creation\nUnit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to\nthe time specified by a Fund or its custodian\non the Business Day after the date of\nsubmission of such redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant\u2019s delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nHandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by a Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business Day after the date of submission\nof such redemption request and shall be held\nby Citibank and marked-to-market daily. The\nfees of Citibank and any sub-custodians in\nrespect of the delivery, maintenance and\nredelivery of the collateral shall be payable\nby the Authorized Participant. The Authorized\nParticipant Agreement permits the Funds to\nacquire shares of the Funds at any time and\nsubjects the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the\naggregate of the cost to the Funds of\n\n92\n\npurchasing such shares, plus the value of the\nCash Amount, and the value of the collateral\ntogether with liability for related brokerage\nand other charges. Because the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund may trade on\nexchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange\nis closed or are otherwise not Business Days\nfor the Fund, shareholders may not be able to\nredeem their shares of the Fund or purchase or\nsell shares of the Fund on the Listing\nExchange on days when the NAV of the Fund\ncould be significantly affected by events in\nthe relevant non-U.S. markets. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of\npayment postponed with respect to the Fund:\n(i) for any period during which the Listing\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Listing\nExchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for\nany period during which an emergency exists as\na result of which disposal of the shares of\nthe Fund's portfolio securities or\ndetermination of its NAV is not reasonably\npracticable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Fund may accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\nthe Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. The Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of the Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of the Fund may be taken\ninto account. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for the Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Fund, as set forth in the\nFund's policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets.\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of the\nFund. This summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to the Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in the\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. References to the Fund\nwill also generally apply to the Underlying\nFunds as well. Regulated Investment Company\nQualifications. The Fund intends to qualify\nfor treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of the\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net\n\n93\n\nincome derived from interests in qualified\npublicly-traded partnerships ( i.e.,\npartnerships that are traded on an established\nsecurities market or tradable on a secondary\nmarket, other than partnerships that derive at\nleast 90% of their income from interest,\ndividends, capital gains and other\ntraditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii)\nat the close of each quarter of the Fund's\ntaxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s total assets must be\nrepresented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of the\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. The Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, the Fund fails one of these\ntests and does not timely cure the failure,\nthe Fund will be taxed in the same manner as\nan ordinary corporation and distributions to\nits shareholders will not be deductible by the\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. The\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, the Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, the Fund\nmust distribute to its shareholders at least\nthe sum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than its\nnet realized long-term capital gain over its\nnet realized short-term capital loss), plus or\nminus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its\nnet tax-exempt income for the taxable year.\nThe Fund will be subject to income tax at\nregular corporate rates on any taxable income\nor gains that it does not distribute to its\nshareholders. If the Fund fails to qualify for\nany taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the\ndistribution requirement, all of its taxable\nincome will be subject to tax at regular\ncorporate income tax rates without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand such distributions generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends\nto the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although the\nFund intends to distribute substantially all\nof its net investment income and its capital\ngains for each taxable year, the Fund may\ndecide to retain a portion of its income or\ngains if the Fund determines that doing so is\nin the interest of its shareholders. The Fund\nwill be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. If the Fund fails\nto qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay\nout its earnings and profits accumulated in\nthat year in order to qualify again as a RIC.\nIf the Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a\nperiod greater than two taxable years, the\nFund may be required to recognize any net\nbuilt-in gains with respect to certain of its\nassets ( i.e., the excess of the aggregate\ngains, including items of income, over\naggregate losses that would have been realized\nwith respect to such assets if the Fund had\nbeen liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Excise Tax. The Fund will be\nsubject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by the Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. The Fund intends to declare and\ndistribute dividends and distributions in the\namounts and at the times necessary to avoid\nthe application of this 4% excise tax. Long-\nterm capital distributions from the Underlying\nFunds paid in December or, in certain cases,\nJanuary in satisfaction of this rule will be\nsubject to potential distribution by the Fund\nin the following calendar year. Net Capital\nLoss Carryforwards. Net capital loss\ncarryforwards may be applied against any net\nrealized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero.\n\n94\n\nIn the event that the Fund were to experience\nan ownership change as defined under the\nInternal Revenue Code, the loss carryforwards\nand other favorable tax attributes of the\nFund, if any, may be subject to limitation.\nThe Fund had net capital loss carryforwards as\nset forth in the table below as of July 31,\n2023, the tax year-end for the Fund:\n                                              \n  Fund                   Non-ExpiringCapital  \n                            LossCarryforward  \n  iShares Morningstar                         \n  Multi-Asset                    $53,728,238  \n  IncomeETF                                   \n                                              \nTaxation of U.S. Shareholders. Dividends and\nother distributions by the Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by the Fund\nin October, November or December of any\ncalendar year and payable to shareholders of\nrecord on a specified date in such a month\nshall be deemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if the Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\nthe Fund reports as capital gains dividends\nare taxable as long-term capital gains,\nwhether paid in cash or in shares and\nregardless of how long a shareholder has held\nshares of the Fund. All other dividends of the\nFund (including dividends from short-term\ncapital gains) from its current and\naccumulated earnings and profits ( \u201c regular\ndividends \u201d ) are generally subject to tax as\nordinary income, subject to the discussion of\nqualified dividend income below. Because the\nFund is expected to invest in an Underlying\nFund, the Fund\u2019s realized losses on sales of\nshares of an Underlying Fund may be\nindefinitely or permanently deferred as \u201c wash\nsales. \u201d Distributions of short-term capital\ngains by an Underlying Fund will be recognized\nas ordinary income by the Fund and would not\nbe offset by the Fund\u2019s capital loss\ncarryforwards, if any. Capital loss\ncarryforwards of an Underlying Fund, if any,\nwould not offset net capital gains of the\nFund. Long-term capital gains are eligible for\ntaxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for\nnon-corporate shareholders, depending on\nwhether their income exceeds certain threshold\namounts. If an individual receives a regular\ndividend qualifying for the long-term capital\ngains rates and such dividend constitutes an \u201c\nextraordinary dividend, \u201d and the individual\nsubsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or\nexchange of stock in respect of which the\nextraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss\nwill be long-term capital loss to the extent\nof such extraordinary dividend. An \u201c\nextraordinary dividend \u201d on common stock for\nthis purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an\namount greater than or equal to 10% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within an 85-day period, or\n(ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within a 365-day period.\nDistributions in excess of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits will, as\nto each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free\nreturn of capital to the extent of a\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund, and\nas a capital gain thereafter (if the\nshareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets). Distributions in excess of\nthe Fund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements,\nbut not in excess of the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. Shareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be\n\n95\n\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas receiving a distribution in an amount equal\nto the amount of money that the shareholders\nreceiving cash dividends or distributions will\nreceive and should have a cost basis in the\nshares received equal to such amount.\nDividends paid by an Underlying Fund that are\nattributable to dividends received by the Fund\nfrom domestic corporations may qualify for the\nfederal dividends received deduction for\ncorporations. A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on net investment\nincome, including, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates and trusts.\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution may nevertheless be\ntaxable to them. If the Fund is the holder of\nrecord of any security on the record date for\nany dividends payable with respect to such\nsecurity, such dividends will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income not as of the date\nreceived but as of the later of (a) the date\nsuch security became ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividends ( i.e. , the date on which a\nbuyer of the security would not be entitled to\nreceive the declared, but unpaid, dividends);\nor (b) the date the Fund acquired such\nsecurity. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its\nincome distribution requirements, the Fund may\nbe required to pay dividends based on\nanticipated earnings, and shareholders may\nreceive dividends in an earlier year than\nwould otherwise be the case. In certain\nsituations, the Fund may, for a taxable year,\ndefer all or a portion of its net capital loss\n(or if there is no net capital loss, then any\nnet long-term or short-term capital loss)\nrealized after October and its late-year\nordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the\nexcess of post-October foreign currency and\npassive foreign investment company ( \u201c PFIC \u201d\n) losses over post-October foreign currency\nand PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-\nDecember ordinary losses over post-December\nordinary income) until the next taxable year\nin computing its investment company taxable\nincome and net capital gain, which will defer\nthe recognition of such realized losses. Such\ndeferrals and other rules regarding gains and\nlosses realized after October (or December)\nmay affect the tax character of shareholder\ndistributions. Sales of Shares. Upon the sale\nor exchange of shares of the Fund, a\nshareholder will realize a taxable gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the\namount realized and the shareholder\u2019s basis in\nshares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by\nthe Fund will be treated as a sale for this\npurpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are capital\nassets in the shareholder\u2019s hands and will be\nlong-term capital gain or loss if the shares\nare held for more than one year and short-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor one year or less. Any loss realized on a\nsale or exchange will be disallowed to the\nextent the shares disposed of are replaced,\nincluding replacement through the reinvesting\nof dividends or capital gains distributions,\nor by an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of the Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, the Fund will be required to withhold\nat a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury\nsuch amounts withheld from any distributions\npaid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to the\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability.\n\n96\n\nSections 351 and 362. The Trust, on behalf of\nthe Fund, has the right to reject an order for\na purchase of shares of the Fund if the\npurchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon\nobtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or\nmore of the outstanding shares of the Fund and\nif, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, the Fund would have a\nbasis in the securities different from the\nmarket value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. If the Fund\u2019s basis in such\nsecurities on the date of deposit was less\nthan market value on such date, the Fund, upon\ndisposition of the securities, would recognize\nmore taxable gain or less taxable loss than if\nits basis in the securities had been equal to\nmarket value. It is not anticipated that the\nTrust will exercise the right of rejection\nexcept in a case where the Trust determines\nthat accepting the order could result in\nmaterial adverse tax consequences to the Fund\nor its shareholders. The Trust also has the\nright to require information necessary to\ndetermine beneficial share ownership for\npurposes of the 80% determination. Taxation of\nCertain Derivatives. An Underlying Fund\u2019s\ntransactions in zero coupon securities,\nnon-U.S. currencies, forward contracts,\noptions and futures contracts (including\noptions and futures contracts on non-U.S.\ncurrencies), to the extent permitted, will be\nsubject to special provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code (including provisions relating to\n\u201c hedging transactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d )\nthat, among other consequences, may affect the\ncharacter of gains and losses realized by the\nFund ( i.e. , may affect whether gains or\nlosses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer\nFund losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also (a) will require an Underlying\nFund to mark-to-market certain types of the\npositions in its portfolio ( i.e. , treat them\nas if they were closed out at the end of each\nyear) and (b) may cause an Underlying Fund to\nrecognize income without receiving cash with\nwhich to pay dividends or make distributions\nin amounts necessary to satisfy the\ndistribution requirements for avoiding income\nand excise taxes. Each Underlying Fund will\nmonitor its transactions, will make the\nappropriate tax elections and will make the\nappropriate entries in its books and records\nwhen it acquires any zero coupon security,\nnon-U.S. currency, forward contract, option,\nfutures contract or hedged investment in order\nto mitigate the effect of these rules and\nprevent disqualification of an Underlying Fund\nas a RIC. An Underlying Fund\u2019s investments in\nso-called \u201c Section 1256 contracts, \u201d such as\nregulated futures contracts, most non-U.S.\ncurrency forward contracts traded in the\ninterbank market and options on most security\nindexes, are subject to special tax rules. All\nSection 1256 contracts held by an Underlying\nFund at the end of its taxable year are\nrequired to be marked to their market value,\nand any unrealized gain or loss on those\npositions will be included in an Underlying\nFund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by an Underlying Fund from positions\nin Section 1256 contracts closed during the\ntaxable year. Provided such positions were\nheld as capital assets and were not part of a\n\u201c hedging transaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c\nstraddle, \u201d 60% of the resulting net gain or\nloss will be treated as long-term capital gain\nor loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will\nbe treated as short-term capital gain or loss,\nregardless of the period of time the positions\nwere actually held by an Underlying Fund. As a\nresult of entering into swap contracts, an\nUnderlying Fund may make or receive periodic\nnet payments. An Underlying Fund may also make\nor receive a payment when a swap is terminated\nprior to maturity through an assignment of the\nswap or other closing transaction. Periodic\nnet payments will generally constitute\nordinary income or deductions, while\ntermination of a swap will generally result in\ncapital gain or loss (which will be a long-\nterm capital gain or loss if an Underlying\nFund has been a party to the swap for more\nthan one year). With respect to certain types\nof swaps, an Underlying Fund may be required\nto currently recognize income or loss with\nrespect to future payments on such swaps or\nmay elect under certain circumstances to mark\nsuch swaps to market annually for tax purposes\nas ordinary income or loss. Qualified Dividend\nIncome. Distributions by the Fund of\ninvestment company taxable income (including\nany short-term capital gains), whether\nreceived in cash or shares, will be taxable\neither as ordinary income or as qualified\ndividend income, which is eligible to be taxed\nat long-term capital gain rates to the extent\nthe Fund receives qualified dividend income on\nthe securities it holds and the Fund reports\nthe distribution as qualified dividend income.\nQualified dividend income is, in general,\ndividend income from taxable U.S. corporations\n(but generally not from U.S. REITs) and\ncertain non-U.S. corporations ( e.g. ,\nnon-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and\nwhich are incorporated in a possession of the\nU.S. or in certain countries with a\ncomprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the\nstock of which is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the U.S.\n(where the dividends are paid with respect to\nsuch stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the\nU.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax\ntreaties with the following countries:\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados,\nBelgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China (but not with\nHong Kong, which is treated as a separate\njurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus,\nthe Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia,\nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\n\n97\n\nPakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\nRomania, Russia, the Slovak Republic,\nSlovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,\nSri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand,\nTrinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine,\nthe U.K. and Venezuela. Substitute payments\nreceived by the Fund for securities lent out\nby the Fund will not be qualified dividend\nincome. A dividend from the Fund will not be\ntreated as qualified dividend income to the\nextent that: (i) the shareholder has not held\nthe shares on which the dividend was paid for\n61 days during the 121-day period that begins\non the date that is 60 days before the date on\nwhich the shares become ex-dividend with\nrespect to such dividend or the Fund fails to\nsatisfy those holding period requirements with\nrespect to the securities it holds that paid\nthe dividends distributed to the shareholder\n(or, in the case of certain preferred stocks,\nthe holding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) the Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by\nthe Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be\ntreated as qualified dividend income only to\nthe extent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by the Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by the Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by the Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from the Underlying Funds and that\nare attributable to dividends paid by U.S.\ncorporations may qualify for the U.S. federal\ndividends received deduction for corporations.\nA 46-day minimum holding period during the\n90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-\ndividend date (or 91-day minimum holding\nperiod during the 180 period beginning 90 days\nprior to ex-dividend date for certain\npreference dividends) during which risk of\nloss may not be diminished is required for the\napplicable shares, at the Fund level, the\nUnderlying Fund level and shareholder level,\nfor a dividend to be eligible for the\ndividends received deduction. Restrictions may\napply if indebtedness, including a short sale,\nis attributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Fund\nserves to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by its\ntax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in\nthe Fund if shares in the Fund constitute\ndebt-financed property in the hands of the\ntax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by an\nUnderlying Fund from REITs, real estate\nmortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage\npools or other investments may cause the Fund\nto report some or all of its distributions as\n\u201c excess inclusion income. \u201d To Fund\nshareholders, such excess inclusion income\nmay: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI\nfor those shareholders who would otherwise be\ntax-exempt such as individual retirement\naccounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans,\npension plans and certain charitable entities;\n(ii) not be offset by otherwise allowable\ndeductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be\neligible for reduced U.S. withholding for\nnon-U.S. shareholders even from tax treaty\ncountries; and (iv) cause the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund to be subject to tax if\ncertain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust. The Fund tries to avoid\ninvesting in REITs that are expected to\ngenerate excess inclusion income, but the Fund\nmay not always be successful in doing so.\nBecause information about a REIT\u2019s investments\nmay be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a\nREIT may change its investment program, the\nFund may not be successful in avoiding the\nconsequences described above. Avoidance of\ninvestments in REITs that generate excess\ninclusion income may require the Fund to\nforego otherwise attractive investment\nopportunities. Non-U.S. Investments. Under\nSection 988 of the Internal Revenue Code,\ngains or losses attributable to fluctuations\nin exchange rates between the time an\nUnderlying Fund accrues income or receivables\nor expenses or other liabilities denominated\nin a non-U.S. currency and the time an\nUnderlying Fund actually collects such income\nor pays such liabilities are generally treated\nas ordinary income or ordinary loss. In\ngeneral, gains (and losses) realized on debt\ninstruments will be treated as Section 988\ngain (or loss) to the extent attributable to\nchanges in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and the currencies in which the\ninstruments are denominated. Similarly, gains\nor losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S.\ncurrency\n\n98\n\nforward contracts and certain non-U.S.\ncurrency options or futures contracts\ndenominated in non-U.S. currency, to the\nextent attributable to fluctuations in\nexchange rates between the acquisition and\ndisposition dates, are also treated as\nordinary income or loss unless an Underlying\nFund were to elect otherwise. If your Fund\nshares are loaned pursuant to securities\nlending arrangements, you may lose the ability\nto use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through\nby the Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid\nwhile the shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\nwith respect to shares of the Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. The Underlying Funds, if invested in\nnon-U.S. positions, may be subject to non-U.S.\nincome taxes and non-U.S. financial\ntransactions taxes. Each Underlying Fund that\nis permitted to do so may elect to \u201c pass\nthrough \u201d to its investors, including the\nFund, the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid\nby the Underlying Fund. If more than 50% of\nthe total assets of an Underlying Fund at the\nclose of a year consist of non-U.S. stocks or\nsecurities (generally for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ) (and 50% of the total assets of\nthe Fund at the close of the year consists of\nnon-U.S. securities, or, at the close of each\nquarter, shares of Underlying Funds), the Fund\nmay be eligible to elect to \u201c pass through \u201d\nsuch amounts to their stockholders and may do\nso, depending upon circumstances. Passive\nForeign Investment Companies. If an Underlying\nFund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on a\nportion of any \u201c excess distribution \u201d or gain\nfrom the disposition of such shares even if\nsuch income is distributed as a taxable\ndividend by the Fund to its shareholders.\nAdditional charges in the nature of interest\nmay be imposed on the Fund in respect of\ndeferred taxes arising from such distributions\nor gains. If an Underlying Fund were to invest\nin a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a \u201c\nqualified electing fund \u201d under the Internal\nRevenue Code, in lieu of the foregoing\nrequirements, an Underlying Fund might be\nrequired to include in income each year a\nportion of the ordinary earnings and net\ncapital gains of the qualified electing fund,\neven if not distributed to an Underlying Fund,\nand such amounts would be subject to the 90%\nand excise tax distribution requirements\ndescribed above. In order to make this\nelection, an Underlying Fund would be required\nto obtain certain annual information from the\nPFICs in which it invests, which may be\ndifficult or impossible to obtain.\nAlternatively, an Underlying Fund may make a\nmark-to-market election that would result in\nan Underlying Fund being treated as if it had\nsold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end\nof each year. In such case, an Underlying Fund\nwould report any such gains as ordinary income\nand would deduct any such losses as ordinary\nlosses to the extent of previously recognized\ngains. The election must be made separately\nfor each PFIC owned by an Underlying Fund and,\nonce made, would be effective for all\nsubsequent taxable years, unless revoked with\nthe consent of the IRS. By making the\nelection, an Underlying Fund could potentially\nameliorate the adverse tax consequences with\nrespect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC,\nbut in any particular year may be required to\nrecognize income in excess of the\ndistributions it receives from PFICs and its\nproceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. An\nUnderlying Fund may have to distribute this \u201c\nphantom \u201d income and gain to satisfy the 90%\ndistribution requirement and to avoid\nimposition of the 4% excise tax. Reporting. If\na shareholder recognizes a loss with respect\nto the Fund\u2019s shares of $2 million or more for\nan individual shareholder or $10 million or\nmore for a corporate shareholder, the\nshareholder must file with the IRS a\ndisclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases exempted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The\nfact that a loss is reportable under these\nregulations does not affect the legal\ndetermination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by the Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by the Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally not subject to such\nwithholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced\nrate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN\nor IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its\nentitlement to benefits under a treaty. The\nwithholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor\n\n99\n\nbusiness within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Properly-reported\ndividends are generally exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax where they (i) are\npaid in respect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net\ninterest income \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S.\nsource interest income, other than certain\ncontingent interest and interest from\nobligations of a corporation or partnership in\nwhich the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder\nor partner, reduced by expenses that are\nallocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term\ncapital gains \u201d (generally, the excess of the\nFund\u2019s net short-term capital gain over the\nFund\u2019s long-term capital loss for such taxable\nyear). However, depending on its\ncircumstances, the Fund may report all, some\nor none of its potentially eligible dividends\nas such qualified net interest income or as\nqualified short-term capital gains and/or\ntreat such dividends, in whole or in part, as\nineligible for this exemption from\nwithholding. In order to qualify for this\nexemption from withholding, a non-U.S.\nshareholder will need to comply with\napplicable certification requirements relating\nto its non-U.S. status (including, in general,\nfurnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of\nshares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if the Fund\nreports the payment as qualified net interest\nincome or qualified short-term capital gain.\nNon-U.S. shareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts. Special\nrules may apply to a foreign shareholder\nreceiving a Fund distribution if at least 50%\nof the Fund's assets consist of interests in\nU.S. real property interests, including\ncertain REITs and U.S. real property holding\ncorporations (as defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund\ndistributions that are attributable to gain\nfrom the disposition of a U.S. real property\ninterest will be taxable as ordinary dividends\nand subject to withholding at a 30% or lower\ntreaty rate if the foreign shareholder held no\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time\nduring the one-year period ending on the date\nof the distribution. If the foreign\nshareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's\nshares, the distribution would be treated as\nincome effectively connected with a trade or\nbusiness within the U.S. and the foreign\nshareholder would be subject to withholding\ntax at a rate of 21% and would generally be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences would generally\napply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the\nsale of Fund shares unless the Fund is\ndomestically controlled (meaning that more\nthan 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is\nheld by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign\nshareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of sale. Finally, a\ndomestically controlled Fund may be required\nto recognize a portion of its gain on the in-\nkind distribution of certain U.S. real\nproperty interests. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund. The rules\nlaid out in the previous two paragraphs, other\nthan the withholding rules, will apply\nnotwithstanding a Fund's or an Underlying\nFund's participation in a wash sale\ntransaction or its payment of a substitute\ndividend. Shareholders that are nonresident\naliens or foreign entities are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors concerning the\nparticular tax consequences to them of an\ninvestment in a Fund. Separately, a 30%\nwithholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to: (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply.\n\n100\n\nShares of the Fund held by a non-U.S.\nshareholder at death will be considered\nsituated within the U.S. and subject to the\nU.S. estate tax. The foregoing discussion is a\nsummary of certain material U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations only and is not\nintended as a substitute for careful tax\nplanning. Purchasers of shares should consult\ntheir own tax advisors as to the tax\nconsequences of investing in such shares,\nincluding consequences under state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the foregoing\ndiscussion is based on applicable provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code, regulations,\njudicial authority and administrative\ninterpretations in effect on the date of this\nSAI. Changes in applicable authority could\nmaterially affect the conclusions discussed\nabove, and such changes often occur.

We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals. We also publish a quarterly list of\nall companies with which we engaged and the\nkey topics addressed in the engagement\nmeeting. In this way, we help inform our\nclients about the work we do on their behalf\nin promoting the governance and business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\n11 The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.\n\nA-15\n\nAppendix B \u2013 Description of Fixed-Income\nRatings A rating is generally assigned to a\nfixed-income security at the time of issuance\nby a credit rating agency designated as a\nNRSRO by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time\nto time revise such ratings, they undertake no\nobligation to do so, and the ratings given to\nsecurities at issuance do not necessarily\nrepresent ratings which would be given to\nthese securities on a particular subsequent\ndate. NRSROs may rate specific investments (\ne.g. , bonds), issuers ( e.g. , corporations,\ngovernments and financial institutions) and/or\nprograms ( e.g. , commercial paper programs).\nHowever, certain types of investments may not\nbe rated by NRSROs, such as certain\ngovernment/sovereign obligations, US agency\nsecurities, commercial paper, time deposits at\nfinancial institutions, and derivative\ninstruments such as credit default swaps. For\nthese types of investments, as well as US\nTreasury securities (some of which are not\nrated), where a NRSRO has not rated the\nspecific investment but has rated the\ninvestment\u2019s issuer, program, financial\ninstitution or underlying reference asset, BFA\nmay consider the investment to have the same\nNRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial\ninstitution or underlying reference asset, as\napplicable. In the case of municipal\nsecurities, where one NRSRO provides multiple\nratings for the same security ( e.g. , \u201c\nunderlying, \u201d \u201c insured \u201d and/or \u201c enhanced \u201d\nratings), BFA may consider the security to\nhave the highest of the multiple ratings. New\nissue securities (regardless of type) may not\nbe rated by a NRSRO at the time of their\ninitial offering. Preliminary prospectuses or\nterm sheets for new issue securities may\ninclude an expected rating for the security\n(as determined by the underwriter and/or\nissuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of\nthe security. If applicable, when deciding\nwhether to purchase a new issue security that\nhas not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may\nattribute an expected rating to the security\nbased on: (i) the expected rating of the\nsecurity set forth in the preliminary\nprospectus or term sheet for the security;\n(ii) the NRSRO\u2019s rating for the issuer of the\nsecurity set forth in the preliminary\nprospectus or term sheet for the security; or\n(iii) with respect to asset-backed securities,\nthe rating of a prior issuance having a\nsimilar structure or the same sponsor. Where\nthe investment objective of the Fund is to\ntrack the performance of an index that\nincludes credit ratings eligibility criteria\nas part of its index methodology, the Fund may\npurchase any security within the index, such\nsecurity having been determined by the index\nprovider as meeting its credit ratings\neligibility criteria. The credit ratings\npractices of an index provider may differ from\nBlackRock\u2019s practices, as described above.\nFurther, the Fund may invest, directly or\nindirectly, in securities that are not rated\nby a rating agency or securities with a credit\nrating that differs from the credit rating\nspecified in its index methodology in various\ncircumstances, including where a security is\ndowngraded but not yet removed from an index,\nfollowing the removal of a security from an\nindex prior to its sale by the Fund or as a\nresult of a corporate action or restructuring\naffecting an issuer of a security held by the\nFund. Fixed-income securities which are\nunrated may expose the investor to risks with\nrespect to capacity to pay interest or repay\nprincipal which are similar to the risks of\nlower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of\nthese securities is dependent on the\ninvestment adviser\u2019s judgment, analysis and\nexperience in the evaluation of such\nsecurities. Investors should note that the\nassignment of a rating to a security by an\nNRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent\ndevelopments on the issuer\u2019s ability to make\ninterest and principal payments or on the\nlikelihood of default. Securities deemed to be\nhigh yield are rated below Baa3 by Moody\u2019s and\nbelow BBB- by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch.\nThe descriptions below relate to general long-\nterm and short-term obligations of an issuer.\nMoody\u2019s Ratings Long-Term Obligations Aaa:\nObligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the\nhighest quality, subject to the lowest level\nof credit risk. Aa: Obligations rated Aa are\njudged to be of high quality and are subject\nto very low credit risk. A: Obligations rated\nA are judged to be upper-medium grade and are\nsubject to low credit risk. Baa: Obligations\nrated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and\nsubject to moderate credit risk and as such\nmay possess certain speculative\ncharacteristics.\n\nB-1\n\nBa: Obligations rated Ba are judged to be\nspeculative and are subject to substantial\ncredit risk. B: Obligations rated B are\nconsidered speculative and are subject to high\ncredit risk. Caa: Obligations rated Caa are\njudged to be speculative, of poor standing and\nare subject to very high credit risk. Ca:\nObligations rated Ca are highly speculative\nand are likely in, or very near, default, with\nsome prospect of recovery of principal and\ninterest. C: Obligations rated C are the\nlowest rated and are typically in default,\nwith little prospect for recovery of principal\nor interest. Note: Moody's appends numerical\nmodifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating\nclassification from Aa through Caa. The\nmodifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks\nin the higher end of its generic rating\ncategory; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range\nranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a\nranking in the lower end of that generic\nrating category. Absence of Rating: Where no\nrating has been assigned or where a rating has\nbeen withdrawn, it may be for reasons\nunrelated to the creditworthiness of the\nissue. Should no rating be assigned, the\nreason may be one of the following: 1. An\napplication was not received or accepted. 2.\nThe issue or issuer belongs to a group of\nsecurities or entities that are not rated as a\nmatter of policy. 3. There is a lack of\nessential data pertaining to the issue or\nissuer. 4. The issue was privately placed, in\nwhich case the rating is not published in\nMoody\u2019s publications. Withdrawal may occur if\nnew and material circumstances arise, the\neffects of which preclude satisfactory\nanalysis; if there is no longer available\nreasonable up-to-date data to permit a\njudgment to be formed; if a bond is called for\nredemption; or for other reasons. Short-Term\nObligations Moody\u2019s short-term debt ratings\nare opinions of the ability of issuers to\nhonor short-term financial obligations,\ngenerally with an original maturity not\nexceeding thirteen months. Moody's employs the\nfollowing designations to indicate the\nrelative repayment ability of rated issuers:\nP-1: Issuers (or supporting institutions)\nrated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay\nshort-term debt obligations. P-2: Issuers (or\nsupporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a\nstrong ability to repay short-term debt\nobligations. P-3: Issuers (or supporting\ninstitutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable\nability to repay short-term obligations. NP:\nIssuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not\nPrime do not fall within any of the Prime\nrating categories. US Municipal Short-Term\nDebt Obligations There are three rating\ncategories for short-term municipal\nobligations that are considered investment-\ngrade and are designated as Municipal\nInvestment Grade (MIG). In addition, those\nshort-term obligations that are of speculative\nquality are designated SG, or speculative\ngrade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of\nthe obligation. MIG 1: This designation\ndenotes superior credit quality. Excellent\nprotection is afforded by established cash\nflows, highly reliable liquidity support, or\ndemonstrated broad-based access to the market\nfor refinancing. MIG 2: This designation\ndenotes strong credit quality. Margins of\nprotection are ample, although not as large as\nin the preceding group. MIG 3: This\ndesignation denotes acceptable credit quality.\nLiquidity and cash-flow protection may be\nnarrow, and market access for refinancing is\nlikely to be less well-established.\n\nB-2\n\nSG: This designation denotes speculative-grade\ncredit quality. Debt instruments in this\ncategory may lack sufficient margins of\nprotection. S&P Global Ratings Long-Term\nObligations AAA: An obligation rated AAA has\nthe highest rating assigned by S&P Global\nRatings. The obligor\u2019s capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation is\nextremely strong. AA: An obligation rated AA\ndiffers from the highest-rated obligations\nonly to a small degree. The obligor\u2019s capacity\nto meet its financial commitment is very\nstrong. A: An obligation rated A is somewhat\nmore susceptible to the adverse effects of\nchanges in circumstances and economic\nconditions than obligations in higher-rated\ncategories. However, the obligor\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial commitment on the\nobligation is still strong. BBB: An obligation\nrated BBB exhibits adequate protection\nparameters. However, adverse economic\nconditions or changing circumstances are more\nlikely to lead to a weakened capacity of the\nobligor to meet its financial commitment on\nthe obligation. BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:\nObligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are\nregarded as having significant speculative\ncharacteristics. BB indicates the least degree\nof speculation and C the highest. While such\nobligations will likely have some quality and\nprotective characteristics, these may be\noutweighed by large uncertainties or major\nexposures to adverse conditions. BB: An\nobligation rated BB is less vulnerable to\nnonpayment than other speculative issues.\nHowever, it faces major ongoing uncertainties\nor exposure to adverse business, financial, or\neconomic conditions which could lead to the\nobligor\u2019s inadequate capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation. B: An\nobligation rated B is more vulnerable to\nnonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the\nobligor currently has the capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation.\nAdverse business, financial, or economic\nconditions will likely impair the obligor\u2019s\ncapacity or willingness to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. CCC: An\nobligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable\nto nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable\nbusiness, financial, and economic conditions\nfor the obligor to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. In the event of\nadverse business, financial, or economic\nconditions, the obligor is not likely to have\nthe capacity to meet its financial commitment\non the obligation. CC: An obligation rated CC\nis currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.\nThe CC rating is used when a default has not\nyet occurred, but S&P Global Ratings expects\ndefault to be a virtual certainty, regardless\nof the anticipated time to default. C: An\nobligation rated C is currently highly\nvulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation\nis expected to have lower relative seniority\nor lower ultimate recovery compared to\nobligations that are rated higher. D: An\nobligation rated D is in default or in breach\nof an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital\ninstruments, the D rating category is used\nwhen payments on an obligation are not made on\nthe date due, unless S&P Global Ratings\nbelieves that such payments will be made\nwithin five business days in the absence of a\nstated grace period or within the earlier of\nthe stated grace period or 30 calendar days.\nThe D rating also will be used upon the filing\nof a bankruptcy petition or the taking of\nsimilar action and where default on an\nobligation is a virtual certainty, for example\ndue to automatic stay provisions. An\nobligation's rating is lowered to D if it is\nsubject to a distressed exchange offer. NR: NR\nindicates no rating has been requested, or\nthat there is insufficient information on\nwhich to base a rating, or that S&P Global\nRatings does not rate a particular obligation\nas a matter of policy. Note: The ratings from\nAA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a\nplus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative\nstanding within the major rating categories.\nShort-Term Obligations\n\nB-3\n\nA-1: A short-term obligation rated A-1 is\nrated in the highest category by S&P Global\nRatings. The obligor's capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation is\nstrong. Within this category, certain\nobligations are designated with a plus sign\n(+). This indicates that the obligor's\ncapacity to meet its financial commitment on\nthese obligations is extremely strong. A-2: A\nshort-term obligation rated A-2 is somewhat\nmore susceptible to the adverse effects of\nchanges in circumstances and economic\nconditions than obligations in higher rating\ncategories. However, the obligor's capacity to\nmeet its financial commitment on the\nobligation is satisfactory. A-3: A short-term\nobligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate\nprotection parameters. However, adverse\neconomic conditions or changing circumstances\nare more likely to lead to a weakened capacity\nof the obligor to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. B: A short-term\nobligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable\nand has significant speculative\ncharacteristics. The obligor currently has the\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments;\nhowever, it faces major ongoing uncertainties\nwhich could lead to the obligor's inadequate\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments. C:\nA short-term obligation rated C is currently\nvulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon\nfavorable business, financial, and economic\nconditions for the obligor to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation. D: A\nshort-term obligation rated D is in default or\nin breach of an imputed promise. For non-\nhybrid capital instruments, the D rating\ncategory is used when payments on an\nobligation are not made on the date due,\nunless S&P Global Ratings believes that such\npayments will be made within any stated grace\nperiod. However, any stated grace period\nlonger than five business days will be treated\nas five business days. The D rating also will\nbe used upon the filing of a bankruptcy\npetition or the taking of a similar action and\nwhere default on an obligation is a virtual\ncertainty, for example due to automatic stay\nprovisions. An obligation's rating is lowered\nto D if it is subject to a distressed exchange\noffer. Municipal Short-Term Obligations An S&P\nU.S. municipal note rating reflects S&P Global\nRatings opinion about the liquidity factors\nand market access risks unique to the notes.\nNotes due in three years or less will likely\nreceive a note rating. Notes with an original\nmaturity of more than three years will most\nlikely receive a long-term debt rating. SP-1:\nStrong capacity to pay principal and interest.\nAn issue determined to possess a very strong\ncapacity to pay debt service is given a plus\n(+) designation. SP-2: Satisfactory capacity\nto pay principal and interest, with some\nvulnerability to adverse financial and\neconomic changes over the term of the notes.\nSP-3: Speculative capacity to pay principal\nand interest. Fitch Ratings Long-Term\nObligations AAA: Highest credit quality. AAA\nratings denote the lowest expectation of\ncredit risk. They are assigned only in cases\nof exceptionally strong capacity for payment\nof financial commitments. This capacity is\nhighly unlikely to be adversely affected by\nforeseeable events. AA: Very high credit\nquality. AA ratings denote expectations of\nvery low credit risk. They indicate very\nstrong capacity for payment of financial\ncommitments. This capacity is not\nsignificantly vulnerable to foreseeable\nevents. A: High credit quality. A ratings\ndenote expectations of low credit risk. The\ncapacity for payment of financial commitments\nis considered strong. This capacity may,\nnevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse\nbusiness or economic conditions than is the\ncase for higher ratings. BBB: Good credit\nquality. BBB ratings indicate that\nexpectations of credit risk are currently low.\nThe capacity for payment of financial\ncommitments is considered adequate but adverse\nbusiness or economic conditions are more\nlikely to impair this capacity.\n\nB-4\n\nBB: Speculative. BB ratings indicate an\nelevated vulnerability to credit risk,\nparticularly in the event of adverse changes\nin business or economic conditions over time;\nhowever, business or financial alternatives\nmay be available to allow financial\ncommitments to be met. B: Highly speculative.\nB ratings indicate that material credit risk\nis present. CCC: Substantial credit risk. CCC\nratings indicate that substantial credit risk\nis present. CC: Very high levels of credit\nrisk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of\ncredit risk. C: Exceptionally high levels of\ncredit risk. C indicates exceptionally high\nlevels of credit risk. Defaulted obligations\ntypically are not assigned RD or D ratings,\nbut are instead rated in the B to C rating\ncategories, depending upon their recovery\nprospects and other relevant characteristics.\nThis approach better aligns obligations that\nhave comparable overall expected loss but\nvarying vulnerability to default and loss.\nNote: The modifiers \u201c + \u201d or \u201c - \u201d may be\nappended to a rating to denote relative status\nwithin major rating categories. Such suffixes\nare not added to the AAA obligation rating\ncategory, or to corporate finance obligation\nratings in the categories below CCC. The\nsubscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to\ndenote embedded market risk which is beyond\nthe scope of the rating. The designation is\nintended to make clear that the rating solely\naddresses the counterparty risk of the issuing\nbank. It is not meant to indicate any\nlimitation in the analysis of the counterparty\nrisk, which in all other respects follows\npublished Fitch criteria for analyzing the\nissuing financial institution. Fitch does not\nrate these instruments where the principal is\nto any degree subject to market risk. Short-\nTerm Obligations (Corporate and Public\nFinance) A short-term issuer or obligation\nrating is based in all cases on the short-term\nvulnerability to default of the rated entity\nor security stream and relates to the capacity\nto meet financial obligations in accordance\nwith the documentation governing the relevant\nobligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to\nobligations whose initial maturity is viewed\nas \u201c short-term \u201d based on market convention.\nTypically, this means up to 13 months for\ncorporate, sovereign, and structured\nobligations, and up to 36 months for\nobligations in U.S. public finance markets.\nF1: Highest short-term credit quality.\nIndicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for\ntimely payment of financial commitments; may\nhave an added \u201c + \u201d to denote any\nexceptionally strong credit feature. F2: Good\nshort-term credit quality. Good intrinsic\ncapacity for timely payment of financial\ncommitments. F3: Fair short-term credit\nquality. The intrinsic capacity for timely\npayment of financial commitments is adequate.\nB: Speculative short-term credit quality.\nMinimal capacity for timely payment of\nfinancial commitments, plus heightened\nvulnerability to near term adverse changes in\nfinancial and economic conditions. C: High\nshort-term default risk. Default is a real\npossibility. RD: Restricted default. Indicates\nan entity that has defaulted on one or more of\nits financial commitments, although it\ncontinues to meet other financial obligations.\nTypically applicable to entity ratings only.\nD: Default. Indicates a broad-based default\nevent for an entity, or the default of a\nshort-term obligation.

Fund\nThe Trust currently consists of more than 330\ninvestment series or portfolios. The Trust was\norganized as a Delaware statutory trust on\nDecember 16, 1999 and is authorized to have\nmultiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 Act.\nThe offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ). This SAI\nrelates solely to the Fund. The Fund is\nmanaged by BFA, an indirect wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally\nseeks to track the investment results of the\nspecific benchmark index identified in the\nFund's Prospectus (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ).\nThe Fund offers and issues shares at their net\nasset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares\n(each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ), generally in\nexchange for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other positions\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) included in its\nUnderlying Index (the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d\nor \u201c Creation Basket \u201d ), together with the\ndeposit of a specified cash payment (the \u201c\nCash Component \u201d ). Shares of the Fund are\nlisted for trading on NYSE Arca (the \u201c Listing\nExchange \u201d ), a national securities exchange.\nShares of the Fund are traded in the secondary\nmarket and elsewhere at market prices that may\nbe at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares\nare redeemable only in Creation Units, and,\ngenerally, in exchange for portfolio\nsecurities and a Cash Amount (as defined in\nthe Creation and Redemption of Creation Units-\nRole of the Authorized Participant section of\nthis SAI). Creation Units typically are a\nspecified number of shares, generally 50,000\nor multiples thereof. The Trust reserves the\nright to permit or require that creations and\nredemptions of shares are effected fully or\npartially in cash and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of cash. Shares may be\nissued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities, subject to various conditions,\nincluding a requirement that the Authorized\nParticipant maintain with the Trust collateral\nas set forth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to purchase Deposit\nSecurities. See the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI.\nTransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith creations or redemptions that include a\ncash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin the Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of the Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe Prospectus. Shares of the Fund are listed\nfor trading, and trade throughout the day, on\nthe Listing Exchange and in other secondary\nmarkets. Shares of the Fund may also be listed\non certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no\nassurance that the requirements of the Listing\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nshares of the Fund will continue to be met.\nThe Listing Exchange may, but is not required\nto, remove the shares of the Fund from listing\nif, among other things: (i) following the\ninitial 12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of the Fund; (ii) the Fund is\nno longer eligible to operate in reliance on\nRule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act;\n(iii) any of the other listing requirements\nare not continuously maintained; or (iv) any\nevent shall occur or condition shall exist\nthat, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of the Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission determined by that broker, as well\nas other charges. The Trust reserves the right\nto adjust the share price of the Fund in the\nfuture to maintain convenient trading ranges\nfor investors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund.\n\n1\n\nInvestment Strategies and Risks The Fund seeks\nto achieve its objective by investing\nprimarily in securities issued by issuers that\ncompose the Underlying Index and in\ninvestments that provide substantially similar\nexposure to securities in the Underlying\nIndex. The Underlying Index consists\nexclusively of underlying iShares exchange-\ntraded funds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) (each, an \u201c\nUnderlying Fund \u201d and collectively, the \u201c\nUnderlying Funds \u201d ), that themselves seek\ninvestment results corresponding to their own\nunderlying indexes. The Fund operates as an\nindex fund and is not actively managed.\nAdverse performance of a security in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio will ordinarily not result in\nthe elimination of the security from the\nFund\u2019s portfolio. The Fund engages in\nrepresentative sampling, which is investing in\na sample of securities selected by BFA to have\na collective investment profile similar to\nthat of the Fund's Underlying Index.\nSecurities selected have aggregate investment\ncharacteristics (based on market value and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return variability,\nearnings valuation and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of the Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index. A fund that uses\nrepresentative sampling generally does not\nhold all of the securities that are in its\nunderlying index. Although the Fund does not\nseek leveraged returns, certain instruments\nused by the Fund may have a leveraging effect\nas described below. The Fund will invest at\nleast 80% of its assets in the component\nsecurities of the Underlying Index and to-be-\nannounced transactions ( \u201c TBAs \u201d ) that have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the component securities of\nthe Underlying Index, and the Fund will invest\nat least 90% of its assets in fixed income\nsecurities of the types included in the\nUnderlying Index that BFA believes will help\nthe Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund\nwill invest no more than 10% of its assets in\nfutures, options and swaps contracts that BFA\nbelieves will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index as well as in fixed income\nsecurities other than the types included in\nthe Underlying Index, but which BFA believes\nwill help the Fund track the Underlying Index.\nCash and cash equivalent investments\nassociated with a TBA position will be treated\nas part of that position for purposes of\ncalculating investments in the component\nsecurities of the Underlying Index. Cash and\ncash equivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. Set\nforth below is more detailed information\nregarding types of instruments in which the\nUnderlying Funds, and in some cases, the Fund,\nmay invest, strategies BFA may employ in\npursuit of the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestment objective, and related risks.\nBonds. Certain of the Underlying Funds may\ninvest in U.S. and non-U.S. dollar-denominated\nbonds. A bond is an interest-bearing security\nissued by a U.S. or non-U.S. company or\ngovernmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a\ncontractual obligation to pay interest at a\nstated rate on specific dates and to repay\nprincipal (the bond\u2019s face value) periodically\nor on a specified maturity date. Bonds\ngenerally are used by issuers to borrow money\nfrom investors. An issuer may have the right\nto redeem or \u201c call \u201d a bond before maturity,\nin which case the Fund or an Underlying Fund\nmay have to reinvest the proceeds at lower\nmarket rates. Similarly, the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may have to reinvest interest\nincome or payments received when bonds mature,\nsometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds\nbear interest income at a \u201c coupon \u201d rate that\nis fixed for the life of the bond. The value\nof a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market\ninterest rates fall, and falls when market\ninterest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed-rate\nbond\u2019s yield (income as a percent of the\nbond\u2019s current value) may differ from its\ncoupon rate as its value rises or falls. When\nan investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a\nprice that is greater than its face value, the\ninvestor is purchasing the bond at a premium.\nConversely, when an investor purchases a\nfixed-rate bond at a price that is less than\nits face value, the investor is purchasing the\nbond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are\npurchased at a discount pay less current\nincome than securities with comparable yields\nthat are purchased at face value, with the\nresult that prices for such fixed-rate\nsecurities can be more volatile than prices\nfor such securities that are purchased at face\nvalue. Other types of bonds bear interest at\nan interest rate that is adjusted\nperiodically. Interest rates on \u201c floating\nrate \u201d or \u201c variable rate \u201d bonds may be\nhigher or lower than current market rates for\nfixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with\nsimilar final maturities. Because of their\nadjustable interest rates, the value of \u201c\nfloating rate \u201d or \u201c variable rate \u201d bonds\nfluctuates much less in response to market\ninterest rate movements than the value of\nfixed-rate bonds, but their value may decline\nif their interest rates do not rise as much,\nor as quickly, as interest rates in general.\nThe Fund or an Underlying Fund may treat some\nof these bonds as having a shorter maturity\nfor purposes of calculating the weighted\naverage maturity of its investment portfolio.\nGenerally, prices of higher quality issues\ntend to fluctuate less with changes in market\ninterest rates\n\n2\n\nthan prices of lower quality issues and prices\nof longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate\nmore than prices of shorter maturity issues.\nBonds may be senior or subordinated\nobligations. Senior obligations generally have\nthe first claim on an issuer\u2019s earnings and\nassets and, in the event of liquidation, are\npaid before subordinated obligations. Bonds\nmay be unsecured (backed only by the issuer\u2019s\ngeneral creditworthiness) or secured (backed\nby specified collateral). Borrowing. The Fund\nmay borrow for temporary or emergency\npurposes, including to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The purchase\nof securities while borrowings are outstanding\nmay have the effect of leveraging the Fund.\nThe incurrence of leverage increases the\nFund\u2019s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds\nare subject to interest costs that will reduce\nnet income. Purchasing securities while\nborrowings are outstanding creates special\nrisks, such as the potential for greater\nvolatility in the NAV of Fund shares and in\nthe yield on the Fund\u2019s portfolio. In\naddition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the\namount available (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\nthe Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by the Fund must be made from a\nbank or may result in the Fund being subject\nto covenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire the Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Corporate Bonds.\nCertain of the Underlying Funds may invest in\ninvestment grade and/or high yield corporate\nbonds. High yield corporate bonds may be\ndeemed speculative and more volatile than\nhigher rated securities of similar maturity.\nThe investment return of corporate bonds\nreflects interest earned on the security and\nchanges in the market value of the security.\nThe market value of a corporate bond may be\naffected by changes in the market rate of\ninterest, the credit rating of the issuer, the\nissuer\u2019s performance and perceptions of the\nissuer in the marketplace. There is a risk\nthat the issuers of the securities may not be\nable to meet their obligations on interest or\nprincipal payments at the time called for by\nan instrument. Currency Transactions. A\ncurrency forward contract is an over-the-\ncounter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) obligation to purchase or\nsell a specific currency at a future date,\nwhich may be any fixed number of days greater\nthan two days from the date on which the\ncontract is agreed upon by the parties, at a\nprice set at the time of the contract. A non-\ndeliverable currency forward is an OTC\ncurrency forward settled in a specified\ncurrency, on a specified date, based on the\ndifference between the agreed-upon exchange\nrate and the market exchange rate. A currency\nfutures contract is a contract that trades on\nan organized futures exchange involving an\nobligation to deliver or acquire a specified\namount of a specific currency, at a specified\nprice and at a specified future time. Currency\nfutures contracts may be settled on a net cash\npayment basis rather than by the sale and\ndelivery of the underlying currency. The Fund\nmay engage in currency transactions but does\nnot expect to engage in currency transactions\nfor the purpose of hedging against declines in\nthe value of the Underlying Funds' assets that\nare denominated in a non-U.S. currency. An\nUnderlying Fund may enter into non-U.S.\ncurrency forward and non-U.S. currency futures\ntransactions to facilitate local securities\nsettlements or to protect against currency\nexposure in connection with its distributions\nto shareholders, but may not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes. Foreign\nexchange transactions involve a significant\ndegree of risk and the markets in which\nforeign exchange transactions are effected may\nbe highly volatile, highly specialized and\nhighly technical. Significant changes,\nincluding changes in liquidity and prices, can\noccur in such markets within very short\nperiods of time, often within minutes. Foreign\nexchange trading risks include, but are not\nlimited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty\nrisk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and\npotential interference by foreign governments\nthrough regulation of local exchange markets,\nforeign investment or particular transactions\nin non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the correlation of an\nUnderlying Fund's return with the performance\nof its Underlying Index and may lower an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s return. Each Underlying Fund\ncould experience losses if the value of its\ncurrency forwards, options or futures\npositions were poorly correlated with its\nother investments or if it could not close out\nits positions because of an illiquid market or\notherwise. In addition, each Underlying Fund\ncould incur transaction costs, including\ntrading commissions, in connection with\ncertain non-U.S. currency transactions.\n\n3\n\nDiversification Status. The Fund is classified\nas a diversified fund under the 1940 Act. This\nmeans that the Fund may not purchase\nsecurities of an issuer (other than (i)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\nand (ii) securities of other investment\ncompanies) if, with respect to 75% of its\ntotal assets, (a) more than 5% of the Fund\u2019s\ntotal assets would be invested in securities\nof that issuer or (b) the Fund would hold more\nthan 10% of the outstanding voting securities\nof that issuer. With respect to the remaining\n25% of its total assets, the Fund may invest\nmore than 5% of its assets in one issuer.\nUnder the 1940 Act, the Fund cannot change its\nclassification from diversified to non-\ndiversified without shareholder approval. The\nFund intends to maintain the required level of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a regulated\ninvestment company ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S.\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective. Equity Securities. Equity\nsecurities generally have greater price\nvolatility than fixed-income securities. The\nmarket price of equity securities may go up or\ndown, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.\nEquity securities may decline in value due to\nfactors affecting equity securities markets\ngenerally; particular industries, sectors or\ngeographic regions represented in those\nmarkets; or individual issuers. The types of\ndevelopments that may affect an issuer of an\nequity security include management\nperformance, financial leverage and reduced\ndemand for the issuer's goods or services.\nCommon and preferred stock represent equity or\nownership interests in an issuer. Preferred\nstock, however, pays dividends at a specified\nrate and has precedence over common stock in\nthe payment of dividends. In the event an\nissuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy,\nthe claims of owners of bonds and preferred\nstock take precedence over the claims of those\nwho own common stock. Futures, Options on\nFutures and Securities Options. Futures\ncontracts, options on futures and securities\noptions may be used by the Fund and certain of\nthe Underlying Funds to simulate investment in\ntheir respective underlying index, to\nfacilitate trading or to reduce transaction\ncosts. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\nenter into futures contracts and options on\nfutures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nfutures exchange. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund will not use futures, options on futures\nor securities options for speculative\npurposes. The Fund and each Underlying Fund\nintend to use futures and options on futures\nin accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d )\npromulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act (\n\u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA, with respect to the Fund and\nthe Underlying Funds, has claimed an exclusion\nfrom the definition of the term \u201c commodity\npool operator \u201d in accordance with Rule 4.5 so\nthat BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not\nsubject to registration or regulation as a\ncommodity pool operator under the CEA. See the\nRegulation Regarding Derivatives section of\nthis SAI for more information. Futures\ncontracts provide for the future sale by one\nparty and purchase by another party of a\nspecified amount of a specific instrument or\nindex at a specified future time and at a\nspecified price. Stock index contracts are\nbased on investments that reflect the market\nvalue of common stock of the firms included in\nthe investments. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund will be required to deposit\nwith the broker an amount of cash or cash\nequivalents known as \u201c initial margin, \u201d which\nis similar to a performance bond or good faith\ndeposit on the contract and is returned to the\nFund or an Underlying Fund upon termination of\nthe futures contract if all contractual\nobligations have been satisfied. Subsequent\npayments, known as \u201c variation margin, \u201d will\nbe made to and from the broker daily as the\nprice of the instrument or index underlying\nthe futures contract fluctuates, making the\nlong and short positions in the futures\ncontract more or less valuable, a process\nknown as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any time\nprior to the expiration of a futures contract,\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund may elect to\nclose the position by taking an opposite\nposition, which will operate to terminate the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract.\n\n4\n\nThe potential for loss related to the purchase\nof an option on a futures contract is limited\nto the premium paid for the option plus\ntransaction costs. Because the value of the\noption is fixed at the point of sale, there\nare no daily cash payments by the purchaser to\nreflect changes in the value of the underlying\ncontract; however, the value of the option\nchanges daily and that change would be\nreflected in the NAV of the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund. The potential for loss\nrelated to writing call options is unlimited.\nThe potential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\npurchase and write put and call options on\nfutures contracts that are traded on an\nexchange as a hedge against changes in value\nof its portfolio securities or in anticipation\nof the purchase of securities, and may enter\ninto closing transactions with respect to such\noptions to terminate existing positions. There\nis no guarantee that such closing transactions\ncan be effected. Securities options may be\nused by the Fund or an Underlying Fund to\nobtain access to securities in the applicable\nUnderlying Index, to dispose of securities in\nthe applicable Underlying Index at favorable\nprices, to invest cash in a securities index\nthat offers similar exposure to that provided\nby the applicable Underlying Index or\notherwise to achieve the Fund\u2019s or Underlying\nFund's objective of tracking the applicable\nUnderlying Index. A call option gives a holder\nthe right to purchase a specific security at a\nspecified price ( \u201c exercise price \u201d ) within\na specified period of time. A put option gives\na holder the right to sell a specific security\nat an exercise price within a specified period\nof time. The initial purchaser of a call\noption pays the \u201c writer \u201d a premium, which is\npaid at the time of purchase and is retained\nby the writer whether or not such option is\nexercised. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\npurchase put options to hedge its portfolio\nagainst the risk of a decline in the market\nvalue of securities held and may purchase call\noptions to hedge against an increase in the\nprice of securities it is committed to\npurchase. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\nwrite put and call options along with a long\nposition in options to increase its ability to\nhedge against a change in the market value of\nthe securities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\npurchase or sell securities options on a U.S.\nor non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC\nmarket through a transaction with a dealer.\nOptions on a securities index are typically\nsettled on a net basis based on the\nappreciation or depreciation of the index\nlevel over the strike price. Options on single\nname securities may be cash- or physically-\nsettled, depending upon the market in which\nthey are traded. Options may be structured so\nas to be exercisable only on certain dates or\non a daily basis. Options may also be\nstructured to have conditions to exercise (\ni.e. , \u201c Knock-in Events \u201d ) or conditions\nthat trigger termination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out\nEvents \u201d ). High Yield Securities. Certain of\nthe Underlying Funds may invest in non-\ninvestment grade or \u201c high yield \u201d fixed-\nincome or convertible securities are commonly\nknown to investors as \u201c junk bonds \u201d or \u201c high\nyield bonds. \u201d These are generally debt\nsecurities that are rated below investment\ngrade by one or more of the major rating\nagencies or are unrated securities that BFA\nbelieves are of comparable quality. While\ngenerally providing greater income and\nopportunity for gain, non-investment grade\ndebt securities may be subject to greater\nrisks than securities that have higher credit\nratings, including a high risk of default, and\ntheir yields will fluctuate over time. High\nyield securities will generally be in the\nlower rating categories of recognized rating\nagencies (rated below Baa3 by Moody's\nInvestors Service, Inc. ( \u201c Moody's \u201d ) or\nbelow BBB- by S&P Global Ratings or Fitch\nRatings, Inc. ( \u201c Fitch \u201d )) or be unrated.\nThe credit rating of a high yield security\ndoes not necessarily address its market value\nrisk, and ratings may from time to time\nchange, positively or negatively, to reflect\ndevelopments regarding the issuer\u2019s financial\ncondition. High yield securities are\nconsidered to be speculative with respect to\nthe capacity of the issuer to timely repay\nprincipal and pay interest in accordance with\nthe terms of the obligation and may have more\ncredit risk than higher rated securities. The\nmajor risks of high yield bond investments\ninclude the following: \u2022 High yield bonds may\nbe issued by less creditworthy issuers. These\nsecurities are vulnerable to adverse changes\nin the issuer\u2019s industry or to general\neconomic conditions. Issuers of high yield\nbonds may be unable to meet their interest or\nprincipal payment obligations because of an\neconomic downturn, specific issuer\ndevelopments or the unavailability of\nadditional financing. \u2022 The issuers of high\nyield bonds may have a larger amount of\noutstanding debt relative to their assets than\nissuers of investment grade bonds. If the\nissuer experiences financial stress, it may be\nunable to meet its debt obligations. The\nissuer\u2019s ability to pay its debt obligations\nalso may be lessened by specific issuer\ndevelopments, or the unavailability of\nadditional financing. Issuers of high yield\nsecurities are often in the growth stage of\ntheir development and/or involved in a\nreorganization or takeover. \u2022 High yield bonds\nare frequently ranked junior to claims by\nother creditors. If the issuer cannot meet its\nobligations, the senior obligations are\ngenerally paid off before the junior\nobligations, which will potentially limit an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s ability to fully recover\nprincipal, to receive interest payments when\nsenior securities are in default or to receive\nrestructuring benefits paid to holders of more\nsenior classes of debt. Thus, investors in\nhigh yield securities\n\n5\n\nfrequently have a lower degree of protection\nwith respect to principal and interest\npayments than do investors in higher rated\nsecurities. \u2022 High yield bonds frequently have\nredemption features that permit an issuer to\nrepurchase the security from an Underlying\nFund before it matures. If an issuer redeems\nthe high yield bonds, an Underlying Fund may\nhave to invest the proceeds in bonds with\nlower yields and may lose income. \u2022 Prices of\nhigh yield bonds are subject to extreme\nfluctuations. Negative economic developments\nmay have a greater impact on the prices of\nhigh yield bonds than on those of other higher\nrated fixed-income securities. \u2022 Under certain\neconomic and/or market conditions, an\nUnderlying Fund may have difficulty disposing\nof certain high yield securities due to the\nlimited number of investors in that sector of\nthe market. There are fewer dealers in the\nhigh yield bond market, and there may be\nsignificant differences in the prices quoted\nfor high yield bonds by dealers, and such\nquotations may not be the actual prices\navailable for a purchase or sale. Judgment may\nplay a greater role in the prices and values\ngenerated for such securities than in the case\nof securities trading in a more liquid market.\n\u2022 The secondary markets for high yield\nsecurities are not as liquid as the secondary\nmarkets for higher rated securities. The\nsecondary markets for high yield securities\nare concentrated in relatively few market\nmakers and, participants in the markets are\nmostly institutional investors, including\ninsurance companies, banks, other financial\ninstitutions and mutual funds. In addition,\nthe trading volume for high yield securities\nis generally lower than that for higher rated\nsecurities and the secondary markets could\ncontract under adverse market or economic\nconditions independent of any specific adverse\nchanges in the condition of a particular\nissuer. Under certain economic and/or market\nconditions, an Underlying Fund may have\ndifficulty disposing of certain high yield\nsecurities due to the limited number of\ninvestors in that sector of the market. An\nilliquid secondary market may adversely affect\nthe market price of the high yield security,\nwhich may result in increased difficulty\nselling the particular issue and obtaining\naccurate market quotations on the issue when\nvaluing an Underlying Fund's assets. Market\nquotations on high yield securities are\navailable only from a limited number of\ndealers, and such quotations may not be the\nactual prices available for a purchase or\nsale. When the secondary market for high yield\nsecurities becomes more illiquid, or in the\nabsence of readily available market quotations\nfor such securities, the relative lack of\nreliable objective data makes it more\ndifficult to value such securities, and\njudgment plays a more important role in\ndetermining such valuations. \u2022 An Underlying\nFund may incur expenses to the extent\nnecessary to seek recovery upon default or to\nnegotiate new terms with a defaulting issuer.\n\u2022 The high yield bond markets may react\nstrongly to adverse news about an issuer or\nthe economy, or to the perception or\nexpectation of adverse news, whether or not it\nis based on fundamental analysis.\nAdditionally, prices for high yield securities\nmay be affected by legislative and regulatory\ndevelopments. These developments could\nadversely affect an Underlying Fund\u2019s NAV and\ninvestment practices, the secondary market for\nhigh yield securities, the financial condition\nof issuers of these securities and the value\nand liquidity of outstanding high yield\nsecurities, especially in a thinly traded\nmarket. For example, federal legislation\nrequiring the divestiture by federally insured\nsavings and loan associations of their\ninvestments in high yield bonds and limiting\nthe deductibility of interest by certain\ncorporate issuers of high yield bonds\nadversely affected the market in the past.\nInflation-Protected Obligations. Certain of\nthe Underlying Funds may invest in inflation-\nprotected public obligations of the U.S.\nTreasury, commonly known as \u201c TIPS. \u201d TIPS are\na type of U.S. government obligation issued by\nthe U.S. Treasury that are designed to provide\ninflation protection to investors. TIPS are\nincome-generating instruments whose interest\nand principal payments are adjusted for\ninflation - a sustained increase in prices\nthat erodes the purchasing power of money. The\ninflation adjustment, which is typically\napplied monthly to the principal of the bond,\nfollows a designated inflation index, the\nconsumer price index ( \u201c CPI \u201d ), and TIPS\u2019\nprincipal payments are adjusted according to\nchanges in the CPI. A fixed-coupon rate is\napplied to the inflation-adjusted principal so\nthat as inflation rises, both the principal\nvalue and the interest payments increase. This\ncan provide investors with a hedge against\ninflation, as it helps preserve the purchasing\npower of an investment. Because of this\ninflation adjustment feature, inflation-\nprotected bonds typically have lower yields\nthan conventional fixed-rate bonds.\nInvestments in Underlying Funds. Each\nUnderlying Fund is a type of investment\ncompany referred to as an ETF. Each Underlying\nFund is designed to track a particular index\nand is advised by BFA. Shares of the\nUnderlying Funds are listed for trading on\nnational securities exchanges and trade\nthroughout the day on those exchanges and\nother secondary markets.\n\n6\n\nThere can be no assurance that the\nrequirements of the national securities\nexchanges necessary to maintain the listing of\nshares of the Underlying Funds will continue\nto be met. A national securities exchange may,\nbut is not required to, remove the shares of\nthe Underlying Funds from listing if, among\nother things: (i) following the initial\n12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of an Underlying Fund,\nthere are fewer than 50 record and/or\nbeneficial holders of the shares for 30 or\nmore consecutive trading days, (ii) the value\nof an Underlying Fund's underlying index is no\nlonger calculated or available, or (iii) any\nother event shall occur or condition exist\nthat, in the opinion of the national\nsecurities exchange, makes further dealings on\nthe national securities exchange inadvisable.\nA national securities exchange will remove the\nshares of an Underlying Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of such Underlying\nFund. Shares of each Underlying Fund trade on\nexchanges at prices at, above or below their\nmost recent NAV. The per share NAV of each\nUnderlying Fund is calculated at the end of\neach business day and fluctuates with changes\nin the market value of such Underlying Fund's\nholdings since the most recent calculation.\nThe trading prices of an Underlying Fund's\nshares fluctuate continuously throughout\ntrading hours based on market supply and\ndemand rather than NAV. The trading prices of\nan Underlying Fund's shares may deviate\nsignificantly from NAV during periods of\nmarket volatility. Any of these factors may\nlead to an Underlying Fund's shares trading at\na premium or discount to NAV. Exchange prices\nare not expected to correlate exactly with an\nUnderlying Fund's NAV due to timing reasons as\nwell as market supply and demand factors. In\naddition, disruptions to an Underlying Fund's\ncreations and redemptions or the existence of\nextreme market volatility may result in\ntrading prices of Underlying Fund shares that\ndiffer significantly from NAV. If the Fund\npurchases shares of an Underlying Fund at a\ntime when the market price of the Underlying\nFund's shares are at a premium to the NAV or\nsells at a time when the market price of the\nUnderlying Fund is at a discount to the NAV,\nthen the Fund may sustain losses. As in the\ncase of other publicly-traded securities,\nbrokers' commissions on buying or selling\nshares of the Underlying Funds will be based\non negotiated commission rates at customary\nlevels. An investment in an ETF generally\npresents the same primary risks as an\ninvestment in an open-end investment company\nthat is not exchange-traded and that has the\nsame investment objectives, strategies, and\npolicies. However, ETFs are subject to the\nfollowing risks that do not apply to an open-\nend investment company that is not exchange-\ntraded: (i) the market price of the ETF's\nshares may trade at a discount to their net\nasset value; (ii) an active trading market for\nan ETF's shares may not develop or be\nmaintained; or (iii) trading of an ETF's\nshares may be halted if the listing exchange's\nofficials deem such action appropriate, the\nshares are delisted from the exchange, or the\nactivation of market-wide \u201c circuit breakers \u201d\n(which are tied to large swings in stock\nprices) halts stock trading generally. Lending\nPortfolio Securities. The Fund and each\nUnderlying Fund may lend portfolio securities\nto certain borrowers that BFA determines to be\ncreditworthy, including borrowers affiliated\nwith BFA. The borrowers provide collateral\nthat is maintained in an amount at least equal\nto the current market value of the securities\nloaned. No securities loan shall be made on\nbehalf of the Fund or an Underlying Fund if,\nas a result, the aggregate value of all\nsecurities loans of the Fund or the Underlying\nFund exceeds one-third of the value of the\nFund's or the Underlying Fund's total assets\n(including the value of the collateral\nreceived). The Fund or an Underlying Fund may\nterminate a loan at any time and obtain the\nreturn of the securities loaned. The Fund or\nan Underlying Fund receives, by way of\nsubstitute payment, the value of any interest\nor cash or non-cash distributions paid on the\nloaned securities that it would have otherwise\nreceived if the securities were not on loan.\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized\nby cash, the borrower may be entitled to\nreceive a fee based on the amount of cash\ncollateral. The Fund or the Underlying Funds\nare compensated by any positive difference\nbetween the amount earned on the reinvestment\nof cash collateral and the fee paid to the\nborrower. In the case of collateral other than\ncash, the Fund or an Underlying Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund or an Underlying Fund for\nsuch loans, and uninvested cash, may be\nreinvested in certain short-term instruments\neither directly on behalf of the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund or through one or more joint\naccounts or money market funds, including\nthose affiliated with BFA; such investments\nare subject to investment risk. Other\ninvestment companies in which the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund invests can be expected to\nincur fees and expenses for operations, such\nas investment advisory and administration\nfees, that would be in addition to those\nincurred by the Fund or an Underlying Fund.\nThe Fund and each Underlying Fund conduct\ntheir securities lending pursuant to an\nexemptive order from the SEC permitting them\nto lend portfolio securities to borrowers\naffiliated with the Fund or the Underlying\nFund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund or\nthe Underlying Fund to act as securities\nlending agent. To the extent that the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund engages in securities\nlending, BlackRock Institutional Trust\nCompany, N.A. ( \u201c BTC \u201d ) acts as securities\nlending agent for the Fund or the Underlying\nFund, subject to the overall supervision of\nBFA. BTC administers the lending program in\naccordance with guidelines approved by the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the\ntrustees of which are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ).\n\n7\n\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund has agreed to pay a borrower),\nforeign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a\nshortfall at default when a cash collateral\ninvestment is denominated in a currency other\nthan the currency of the assets being loaned\ndue to movements in foreign exchange rates),\nand credit, legal, counterparty and market\nrisks (including the risk that market events,\nincluding but not limited to corporate\nactions, could lead the Fund or an Underlying\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If the Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, the Fund or an Underlying\nFund would be subject to the risk of a\npossible delay in receiving collateral or in\nrecovering the loaned securities, or to a\npossible loss of rights in the collateral. In\nthe event a borrower does not return the\nFund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's securities as\nagreed, the Fund\u2019s or the Underlying Fund's\nability to participate in a corporate action\nevent may be impacted, or the Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund may experience losses if the\nproceeds received from liquidating the\ncollateral do not at least equal the value of\nthe loaned security at the time the collateral\nis liquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nThis latter event could trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund or an Underlying\nFund. The Fund or an Underlying Fund could\nlose money if its short-term investment of the\ncollateral declines in value over the period\nof the loan. Substitute payments received by\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund representing\ndividends paid on securities loaned out by the\nFund or an Underlying Fund will not be\nconsidered qualified dividend income. BTC will\ntake into account the tax effects on\nshareholders caused by this difference in\nconnection with the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying\nFund's securities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to the Fund or an Underlying\nFund (as permitted by applicable law).\nRegulations adopted by global prudential\nregulators require certain bank-regulated\ncounterparties and certain of their affiliates\nto include in certain financial contracts,\nincluding many securities lending agreements,\nterms that delay or restrict the rights of\ncounterparties, such as the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund, to terminate such agreements,\nforeclose upon collateral, exercise other\ndefault rights or restrict transfers of credit\nsupport in the event that the counterparty\nand/or its affiliates are subject to certain\ntypes of resolution or insolvency proceedings.\nIt is possible that these requirements, as\nwell as potential additional government\nregulation and other developments in the\nmarket, could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s or\nan Underlying Fund's ability to terminate\nexisting securities lending agreements or to\nrealize amounts to be received under such\nagreements. Liquidity Risk Management. Rule\n22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the \u201c\nLiquidity Rule \u201d ) requires open-end funds,\nincluding ETFs such as the Fund, to establish\na liquidity risk management program (the \u201c\nLiquidity Program \u201d ) and enhance disclosures\nregarding fund liquidity. As required by the\nLiquidity Rule, the Fund has implemented a\nLiquidity Program, and the Board, including a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees of the\nTrust, has appointed BFA as the administrator\nof the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity\nProgram, BFA assesses, manages, and\nperiodically reviews the Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nand classifies each investment held by the\nFund as a \u201c highly liquid investment, \u201d \u201c\nmoderately liquid investment, \u201d \u201c less liquid\ninvestment \u201d or \u201c illiquid investment. \u201d The\nLiquidity Rule defines \u201c liquidity risk \u201d as\nthe risk that the Fund could not meet requests\nto redeem shares issued by the Fund without\nsignificant dilution of the remaining\ninvestors\u2019 interest in the Fund. The liquidity\nof the Fund's portfolio investments is\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment-specific considerations under\nthe Liquidity Program. There are exclusions\nfrom certain portions of the liquidity risk\nmanagement program requirements for \u201c in-kind\n\u201d ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To\nthe extent that an investment is deemed to be\nan illiquid investment or a less liquid\ninvestment, the Fund can expect to be exposed\nto greater liquidity risk. Mortgage Pass-\nThrough Securities. Certain of the Underlying\nFunds may invest in mortgage pass-through\nsecurities, which are backed by pools of\nmortgages and issued by the Government\nNational Mortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie Mae \u201d\n) or by one of several U.S. government-\nsponsored enterprises, such as the Federal\nNational Mortgage Association ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d\n), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\n( \u201c Freddie Mac \u201d ), or the Federal Home Loan\nBanks ( \u201c FHLBs \u201d ). In the basic mortgage\npass-through structure, mortgages with similar\nissuer, term and coupon characteristics are\ncollected and aggregated into a \u201c pool \u201d\nconsisting of multiple mortgage loans. The\npool is assigned a CUSIP number and undivided\ninterests in the pool are traded and sold as\npass-through securities. The holder of the\nsecurity is entitled to a pro rata share of\nprincipal and interest payments (including\nunscheduled prepayments) from the pool of\nmortgage loans.\n\n8\n\nMortgage securities issued by non-government\nentities may be subject to greater credit risk\nthan those issued by government entities. The\nperformance of privately-issued mortgage\nsecurities may depend on the integrity and\ncompetence of the institutions that originate\nthe underlying mortgages, yet investors in\nthese mortgage securities may have only\nlimited access to information required to\nevaluate the practices of these mortgage\noriginators. In order to prevent defaults by\ntroubled mortgage borrowers, the sponsors of\nmortgage securities may have to renegotiate\nand investors in mortgage securities may have\nto accept less favorable interest rates or\nother terms on the mortgages underlying these\nsecurities. Unanticipated mortgage defaults or\nrenegotiations of mortgage terms are likely to\ndepress the prices of related mortgage\nsecurities. Although mortgage securities may\nbe supported by some form of government or\nprivate guarantee and/or insurance, there is\nno assurance that private guarantors or\ninsurers will meet their obligations.\nGuarantees, insurance and other forms of\ncredit enhancement supporting mortgage\nsecurities may also be insufficient to cover\nall losses on underlying mortgages if mortgage\nborrowers default at a greater than expected\nrate. An investment in a specific pool of\npass-through securities requires an analysis\nof the specific prepayment risk of mortgages\nwithin the covered pool (since mortgagors\ntypically have the option to prepay their\nloans). The level of prepayments on a pool of\nmortgage securities is difficult to predict\nand can impact the subsequent cash flows and\nvalue of the mortgage pool. In addition, when\ntrading specific mortgage pools, precise\nexecution, delivery and settlement\narrangements must be negotiated for each\ntransaction. These factors combine to make\ntrading in mortgage pools somewhat cumbersome.\nFor these and other reasons, an Underlying\nFund may obtain exposure to U.S. agency\nmortgage pass-through securities primarily\nthrough the use of \u201c to-be-announced \u201d or \u201c\nTBA transactions. \u201d \u201c TBA \u201d refers to a\ncommonly used mechanism for the forward\nsettlement of U.S. agency mortgage pass-\nthrough securities, and not to a separate type\nof mortgage-backed securities ( \u201c MBS \u201d ).\nMost transactions in mortgage pass-through\nsecurities occur through the use of TBA\ntransactions. TBA transactions generally are\nconducted in accordance with widely-accepted\nguidelines that establish commonly observed\nterms and conditions for execution, settlement\nand delivery. In a TBA transaction, the buyer\nand seller decide on general trade parameters,\nsuch as agency, settlement date, par amount,\nand price. The actual pools delivered\ngenerally are determined two days prior to the\nsettlement date. An Underlying Fund may use\nTBA transactions in several ways. For example,\nan Underlying Fund may regularly enter into\nTBA agreements and \u201c roll over \u201d such\nagreements prior to the settlement date\nstipulated in such agreements. This type of\nTBA transaction is sometimes known as a \u201c TBA\nroll. \u201d In a \u201c TBA roll, \u201d an Underlying Fund\ngenerally will sell the obligation to purchase\nthe pools stipulated in the TBA agreement\nprior to the stipulated settlement date and\nwill enter into a new TBA agreement for future\ndelivery of pools of mortgage pass-through\nsecurities. In addition, an Underlying Fund\nmay enter into TBA agreements and settle such\ntransactions on the stipulated settlement date\nby accepting actual receipt or delivery of the\npools of mortgage pass-through securities\nstipulated in the TBA agreement. Default by or\nbankruptcy of a counterparty to a TBA\ntransaction would expose an Underlying Fund to\npossible loss because of adverse market\naction, expenses or delays in connection with\nthe purchase or sale of the pools of mortgage\npass-through securities specified in the TBA\ntransaction. To minimize this risk, an\nUnderlying Fund will enter into TBA\ntransactions only with established\ncounterparties (such as major broker-dealers)\nand BFA will monitor the creditworthiness of\nsuch counterparties. The use of \u201c TBA rolls \u201d\nmay cause an Underlying Fund to experience\nhigher portfolio turnover and to pay higher\ncapital gain distributions, which may result\nin larger amounts of short-term capital gains\nallocable to interest holders. The Underlying\nFunds maintain liquid assets in connection\nwith TBA transactions. Mortgage Securities.\nCertain of the Underlying Funds may invest in\nmortgage securities. Mortgage securities are\nissued by government and non-government\nentities such as banks, mortgage lenders, or\nother institutions. A mortgage security is an\nobligation of the issuer that is backed by a\nmortgage or pool of mortgages or a direct\ninterest in an underlying pool of mortgages.\nSome mortgage securities, such as\ncollateralized mortgage obligations, make\npayments of both principal and interest at a\nrange of specified intervals; others make\nsemi-annual interest payments at a pre-\ndetermined rate and repay principal at\nmaturity (like a typical bond). Mortgage\nsecurities are based on different types of\nmortgages, including those on commercial real\nestate or residential properties. Stripped\nmortgage securities are created when the\ninterest and principal components of a\nmortgage security are separated and sold as\nindividual securities. In the case of a\nstripped mortgage security, the holder of the\n\u201c principal-only \u201d security (PO) receives the\nprincipal payments made by the underlying\nmortgage, while the holder of the \u201c interest-\nonly \u201d security (IO) receives interest\npayments from the same underlying mortgage.\nThe value of mortgage securities may change\ndue to shifts in the market's perception of\nthe creditworthiness of issuers and changes in\ninterest rates or liquidity. The value of some\nMBS may be particularly sensitive to changes\nin prevailing interest rates. In addition,\nregulatory or tax changes may adversely affect\nthe mortgage securities market as a whole.\nMortgage securities issued by non-government\nentities may be subject to greater credit risk\nthan those issued by government entities. The\nperformance of privately-issued mortgage\nsecurities may depend on the integrity and\ncompetence of the institutions that originate\nthe underlying mortgages, yet investors in\nthese mortgage securities may have only\nlimited access to\n\n9\n\ninformation required to evaluate the practices\nof these mortgage originators. In order to\nprevent defaults by troubled mortgage\nborrowers, the sponsors of mortgage securities\nmay have to renegotiate and investors in\nmortgage securities may have to accept less\nfavorable interest rates or other terms on the\nmortgages underlying these securities.\nUnanticipated mortgage defaults or\nrenegotiations of mortgage terms are likely to\ndepress the prices of related mortgage\nsecurities. Although mortgage securities may\nbe supported by some form of government or\nprivate guarantee and/or insurance, there is\nno assurance that private guarantors or\ninsurers will meet their obligations.\nGuarantees, insurance and other forms of\ncredit enhancement supporting mortgage\nsecurities may also be insufficient to cover\nall losses on underlying mortgages if mortgage\nborrowers default at a greater than expected\nrate. Non-government mortgage securities may\nbe subject to greater price changes than\ngovernment issues. Mortgage securities are\nsubject to prepayment risk. Prepayment risk is\nthe risk that early principal payments made on\nthe underlying mortgages, usually in response\nto a reduction in interest rates, will result\nin the return of principal to the investor,\ncausing the investor to be invested\nsubsequently at a lower current interest rate.\nAlternatively, in a rising interest rate\nenvironment, mortgage security values may be\nadversely affected when prepayments on\nunderlying mortgages do not occur as\nanticipated, resulting in the extension of the\nsecurity's effective maturity and the related\nincrease in interest rate sensitivity of a\nlonger-term instrument. The prices of stripped\nmortgage securities tend to be more volatile\nin response to changes in interest rates than\nthose of non-stripped mortgage securities. In\naddition, although mortgages and mortgage-\nrelated securities are generally supported by\nsome form of government or private guarantee\nand/or insurance, there is no assurance that\nprivate guarantors or insurers will meet their\nobligations. Non-Diversification Risk. Certain\nof the Underlying Funds may be classified as \u201c\nnon-diversified. \u201d This means that such\nUnderlying Funds may invest a large percentage\nof their assets in securities issued by or\nrepresenting a small number of issuers. As a\nresult, such Underlying Funds may be more\nsusceptible to the risks associated with these\nparticular issuers or to a single economic,\npolitical or regulatory occurrence affecting\nthese issuers. Non-U.S. Securities and\nEmerging Markets Securities. Certain of the\nUnderlying Funds may invest in the securities\nof non-U.S. issuers, which involves special\nrisks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in U.S. issuers.\nThese include differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards,\nthe possibility of expropriation or\npotentially confiscatory taxation, adverse\nchanges in investment or exchange control\nregulations, political instability which could\naffect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries,\npotential restrictions of the flow of\ninternational capital, generally less liquid\nand less efficient securities markets,\ngenerally greater price volatility, less\npublicly available information about issuers,\nhigher transaction and custody costs, delays\nand risks attendant in settlement procedures,\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual\nobligations, less developed judicial systems\nto settle disputes, lesser liquidity and\nsignificantly smaller market capitalization of\nmost non-U.S. securities markets, substantial\ngovernment interference with the economy and\ntransaction costs of foreign currency\nconversions. The Underlying Funds may have\ndifficulty valuing such securities due to\nthese or other considerations. Non-U.S.\nissuers may be subject to less governmental\nregulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover,\nindividual foreign economies may differ\nfavorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy\nwith respect to growth of gross domestic\nproduct ( \u201c GDP \u201d ), rate of inflation,\ncapital reinvestment, resource self-\nsufficiency and balance of payment positions.\nIn addition, changes in foreign exchange rates\nalso will affect the value of securities\ndenominated or quoted in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar. Certain foreign markets have\nspecific geographical risks such as a\nheightened likelihood of earthquakes,\ntsunamis, or volcanoes. Certain foreign\nmarkets also experience acts of terrorism,\nterritorial disputes or other defense\nconcerns. These situations may have a\nsignificant impact on the economies of, and\ninvestments in, these geographic areas. To the\nextent an Underlying Fund invests in publicly\ntraded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers,\ncertain investments in such stocks may be in\nthe form of American Depositary Receipts ( \u201c\nADRs \u201d ), Global Depositary Receipts ( \u201c GDRs\n\u201d ) and European Depositary Receipts ( \u201c EDRs\n\u201d ) (collectively, \u201c depositary receipts \u201d ).\nDepositary receipts are receipts, typically\nissued by a bank or trust issuer, which\nevidence ownership of underlying securities\nissued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary\nreceipts may not necessarily be denominated in\nthe same currency as their underlying\nsecurities. ADRs typically are issued by a\nU.S. bank or trust company and evidence\nownership of underlying securities issued by a\nforeign corporation. EDRs, which are sometimes\nreferred to as Continental depositary\nreceipts, are receipts issued in Europe,\ntypically by foreign banks and trust\ncompanies, that evidence ownership of either\nforeign or domestic underlying securities.\nGDRs are depositary receipts structured like\nglobal debt issues to facilitate trading on an\ninternational basis. Generally, ADRs, issued\nin registered form, are designed for use in\nthe U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, in\nbearer form, are designed for use in European\nsecurities markets. GDRs are tradable both in\nthe U.S. and in Europe and are designed for\nuse throughout the world. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may invest in depositary\nreceipts through \u201c sponsored \u201d or \u201c\nunsponsored \u201d facilities. A sponsored facility\nis established jointly by the issuer of the\nunderlying security and a depositary, whereas\na depositary may establish an unsponsored\nfacility without\n\n10\n\nparticipation by the issuer of the deposited\nsecurity. Holders of unsponsored depositary\nreceipts generally bear all the costs of such\nfacilities and the depositary of an\nunsponsored facility frequently is under no\nobligation to distribute interest holder\ncommunications received from the issuer of the\ndeposited security or to pass through voting\nrights to the holders of such receipts in\nrespect of the deposited securities. The\nissuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are\nnot obligated to disclose material information\nin the U.S. and, therefore, there may be less\ninformation available regarding such issuers\nand there may not be a correlation between\nsuch information and the market value of the\ndepositary receipts. Depositary receipts are\ngenerally subject to the same risks as the\nforeign securities that they evidence or into\nwhich they may be converted. In addition to\ninvestment risks associated with the\nunderlying issuer, depositary receipts expose\neach Underlying Fund to additional risks\nassociated with the non-uniform terms that\napply to depositary receipt programs, credit\nexposure to the depository bank and to the\nsponsors and other parties with whom the\ndepository bank establishes the programs,\ncurrency risk and liquidity risk. Unsponsored\nprograms, which are not sanctioned by the\nissuer of the underlying common stock,\ngenerally expose investors to greater risks\nthan sponsored programs and do not provide\nholders with many of the shareholder benefits\nthat come from investing in sponsored\ndepositary receipts. Obligations of Foreign\nGovernments, Supranational Entities and Banks\n. Certain of the Underlying Funds may invest\nin U.S. dollar-denominated short-term\nobligations issued or guaranteed by one or\nmore foreign governments or any of their\npolitical subdivisions, agencies or\ninstrumentalities that are determined by BFA\nto be of comparable quality to the other\nobligations in which such Underlying Funds may\ninvest. Certain foreign governments,\nspecifically foreign governments in emerging\nmarkets, historically have encountered\ndifficulties in servicing their debt\nobligations, withheld payments of principal\nand interest, and declared moratoria on the\npayment of principal and interest on their\nsovereign debts. Certain of the Underlying\nFunds may also invest in debt obligations of\nsupranational entities. Supranational entities\ninclude international organizations designated\nor supported by governmental entities to\npromote economic reconstruction or development\nand international banking institutions and\nrelated government agencies. Examples include\nthe International Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment (the World Bank), the Asian\nDevelopment Bank and the InterAmerican\nDevelopment Bank. The percentage of the\nUnderlying Funds\u2019 assets invested in\nobligations of foreign governments and\nsupranational entities will vary depending on\nthe relative yields of such securities, the\neconomic and financial markets of the\ncountries in which the investments are made\nand the interest rate climate of such\ncountries. Certain of the Underlying Funds may\ninvest a portion of their total assets in\nhigh-quality, short-term (one year or less)\ndebt obligations of foreign branches of U.S.\nbanks or U.S. branches of foreign banks that\nare denominated in and pay interest in U.S.\ndollars. Emerging Markets. Some non-U.S.\nmarkets in which certain of the Underlying\nFunds invest are considered to be emerging\nmarkets. Investment in these emerging markets\nsubjects an Underlying Fund to a greater risk\nof loss than investments in developed markets.\nThis is due to, among other things, greater\nmarket volatility, lower trading volume,\npolitical and economic instability, greater\nrisk of market shut down and more governmental\nlimitations on foreign investment policy than\nthose typically found in developed markets.\nPrivately Issued Securities. The Fund may\ninvest in privately issued securities,\nincluding those that may be resold only in\naccordance with Rule 144A or Regulation S\nunder the 1933 Act ( \u201c Restricted Securities \u201d\n). Restricted Securities are not publicly-\ntraded and are subject to a variety of\nrestrictions, which limit a purchaser's\nability to acquire or resell such securities.\nAccordingly, the liquidity of the market for\nspecific Restricted Securities may vary. Delay\nor difficulty in selling such securities may\nresult in a loss to the Fund. Ratings. An\ninvestment-grade rating generally means the\nsecurity or issuer is rated investment-grade\nby one or more of Moody\u2019s, S&P Global Ratings,\nFitch, or another credit rating agency\ndesignated as a nationally recognized\nstatistical rating organization ( \u201c NRSRO \u201d )\nby the SEC, or is unrated but considered to be\nof equivalent quality by BFA. Generally, bonds\nrated Baa3 or above by Moody\u2019s or BBB- or\nabove by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch are\nconsidered \u201c investment-grade \u201d securities,\nbonds rated Baa are considered medium grade\nobligations subject to moderate credit risk\nand may possess certain speculative\ncharacteristics, while bonds rated BBB are\nregarded as having adequate capacity to meet\nfinancial commitments. Subsequent to purchase\nby the applicable Underlying Fund, a rated\nsecurity may cease to be rated or its rating\nmay be reduced below an investment-grade\nrating. Bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody\u2019s or\nbelow BBB- by S&P Global Ratings or Fitch are\ngenerally considered below investment-grade\nquality and are obligations of issuers that\nare generally considered predominantly\nspeculative with respect to the issuer\u2019s\ncapacity to pay interest and repay principal\naccording to the terms of the obligation and,\ntherefore, carry greater investment risk,\nincluding the possibility of issuer default\nand bankruptcy and increased market price\nvolatility. Such lower-rated securities are\ncommonly referred to as \u201c junk bonds \u201d and are\nsubject to a\n\n11\n\nsubstantial degree of credit risk. Please see\nAppendix B of this SAI for a description of\neach rating category of Moody's, S&P Global\nRatings and Fitch and BFA's treatment of\ninvestments that are not rated by any of the\nrating agencies. Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives. The CFTC subjects advisers to\nregistered investment companies to regulation\nby the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the\nadviser either (i) invests, directly or\nindirectly, more than a prescribed level of\nits liquidation value in CFTC-regulated\nfutures, options and swaps ( \u201c CFTC\nDerivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent the Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. BFA is not, therefore,\nsubject to registration or regulation as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. The Fund (the \u201c No-Action\nLetter Fund \u201d ) may also have investments in \u201c\nunderlying funds \u201d (and such underlying funds\nthemselves may invest in underlying funds) not\nadvised by BFA (the term \u201c underlying fund \u201d\nfor purposes of the no-action letter\nreferenced below may include, but is not\nlimited to, certain securitized vehicles,\nmortgage or international real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ), business\ndevelopment companies and, investment\ncompanies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives\nor in any of the foregoing), and therefore may\nbe viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA\nmay not have transparency into the holdings of\nthese underlying funds because they are not\nadvised by BFA. To address this issue of lack\nof transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-\naction letter on November 29, 2012 permitting\nthe adviser of a fund that invests in such\nunderlying funds and that would otherwise have\nfiled a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC\nRule 4.5 to delay registration as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d until six months\nfrom the date on which the CFTC issues\nadditional guidance on the treatment of CFTC\nDerivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the\nadviser of the No-Action Letter Fund, has\nfiled a claim with the CFTC for such fund to\nrely on this no-action relief. Accordingly,\nBFA is not currently subject to registration\nor regulation as a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d\nunder the CEA in respect of such fund.\nDerivative contracts, including, without\nlimitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-\ndeliverable forwards, are subject to\nregulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act ( \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under comparable\nregimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.\njurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards\nand certain other derivatives traded in the\nOTC market are subject to variation margin and\ninitial margin requirements. Implementation of\nthe margining and other provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory\ntrading, reporting and documentation of swaps\nand other derivatives have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact the costs to the Fund of\ntrading these instruments and, as a result,\nmay affect returns to investors in the Fund.\nRule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act\npermits the Fund to enter into Derivatives\nTransactions (as defined below) and certain\nother transactions notwithstanding the\nrestrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior\nsecurities \u201d under Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act. Section 18 of the\nInvestment Company Act, among other things,\nprohibits open-end funds, including the Fund,\nfrom issuing or selling any \u201c senior security,\n\u201d other than borrowing from a bank (subject to\na requirement to maintain 300% \u201c asset\ncoverage \u201d ). Under Rule 18f-4, \u201c Derivatives\nTransactions \u201d include the following: (1) any\nswap, security-based swap (including a\ncontract for differences), futures contract,\nforward contract, option (excluding purchased\noptions), any combination of the foregoing, or\nany similar instrument, under which the Fund\nis or may be required to make any payment or\ndelivery of cash or other assets during the\nlife of the instrument or at maturity or early\ntermination, whether as margin or settlement\npayment or otherwise; (2) any short sale\nborrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions ( e.g .,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nand borrowed bonds), if the Fund elects to\ntreat these transactions as Derivatives\nTransactions under Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-\nissued or forward-settling securities ( e.g. ,\nfirm and standby commitments, including TBA\ncommitments, and dollar rolls) and non-\nstandard settlement cycle securities, unless\nthe Fund intends to physically settle the\ntransaction and the transaction will settle\nwithin 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\nUnless the Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires the Fund\nto adopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is\n\n12\n\nappointed by the Board, including a majority\nof Independent Directors/Trustees, and\nperiodically reviews the DRMP and reports to\nthe Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if the Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Repurchase\nAgreements. A repurchase agreement is an\ninstrument under which the purchaser ( i.e. ,\nan Underlying Fund) acquires a security and\nthe seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to\nrepurchase the security at a mutually agreed-\nupon time and price, thereby determining the\nyield during the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by an Underlying Fund but only to\nconstitute collateral for the seller\u2019s\nobligation to pay the repurchase price, and,\nin the event of a default by the seller, such\nUnderlying Fund may suffer time delays and\nincur costs or losses in connection with the\ndisposition of the collateral. In any\nrepurchase transaction, the collateral for a\nrepurchase agreement may include: (i) cash\nitems; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S.\ngovernment or its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that,\nat the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for\nan Underlying Fund, should it decide to\nutilize them. Such risks are not unique to the\nUnderlying Funds, but are inherent in\nrepurchase agreements. The Underlying Funds\nseek to minimize such risks, but because of\nthe inherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, an\nUnderlying Fund would likely retain the status\nof an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (\ni.e. , the position an Underlying Fund would\nnormally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to\nits investment policies, other unsecured debt\nsecurities of the defaulting counterparty)\nwith respect to the amount of the shortfall.\nAs an unsecured creditor, an Underlying Fund\nwould be at risk of losing some or all of the\nprincipal and income involved in the\ntransaction. Reverse Repurchase Agreements.\nReverse repurchase agreements involve the sale\nof securities with an agreement to repurchase\nthe securities at an agreed-upon price, date\nand interest payment and have the\ncharacteristics of borrowing. Generally, the\neffect of such transactions is that an\nUnderlying Fund can recover all or most of the\ncash invested in the portfolio securities\ninvolved during the term of the reverse\nrepurchase agreement, while in many cases the\nUnderlying Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are advantageous\nonly if each Underlying Fund has an\nopportunity to earn a rate of interest on the\ncash derived from these transactions that is\ngreater than the interest cost of obtaining\nthe same amount of cash. Opportunities to\nrealize earnings from the use of the proceeds\nequal to or greater than the interest required\nto be paid may not always be available, and\neach Underlying Fund intends to use the\nreverse repurchase technique only when BFA\nbelieves it will be advantageous to such\nUnderlying Fund. The use of reverse repurchase\nagreements may exaggerate any increase or\ndecrease in the value of each Underlying\nFund\u2019s assets. The use of reverse repurchase\nagreements is a form of leverage, and the\nproceeds obtained through reverse repurchase\nagreements may be invested in additional\nsecurities. Rule 18f-4 under the Investment\nCompany Act permits each Underlying Fund to\nenter into reverse repurchase agreements and\nsimilar financing transactions ( e.g.,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nborrowed bonds) notwithstanding the limitation\non the issuance of senior securities in\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act,\nprovided that each Underlying Fund either (i)\ncomplies with the 300% asset coverage ratio\nwith respect to such transactions and any\nother borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii)\ntreats such transactions as Derivatives\nTransactions under Rule 18f-4. (See \u201c\nRegulation Regarding Derivatives \u201d above.)\n\n13\n\nSecurities of Investment Companies. The Fund\nand each Underlying Fund may invest in the\nsecurities of other investment companies\n(including money market funds) to the extent\npermitted by law, regulation, exemptive order\nor SEC staff guidance. Under the 1940 Act, a\nfund\u2019s investment in investment companies is\nlimited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i)\n3% of the total outstanding voting stock of\nany one investment company, (ii) 5% of the\nfund\u2019s total assets with respect to any one\ninvestment company, and (iii) 10% of the\nfund\u2019s total assets with respect to investment\ncompanies in the aggregate. Other investment\ncompanies in which the Fund or an Underlying\nFund invests can be expected to incur fees and\nexpenses for operations, such as investment\nadvisory and administration fees, which would\nbe in addition to those incurred by the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund. Pursuant to guidance\nissued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of\nmoney market funds used for cash collateral\nreceived in connection with loans of\nsecurities are not treated as Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, which reflect the Fund's\npro rata share of the fees and expenses\nincurred by investing in other investment\ncompanies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as\napplicable). The Fund or an Underlying Fund\nmay purchase shares of ETFs for the same\nreason it would purchase (and as an\nalternative to purchasing) futures contracts \u2013\nto obtain relatively low-cost exposure to the\nstock market while maintaining flexibility to\nmeet its liquidity needs. ETF shares enjoy\nseveral advantages over futures contracts.\nDepending on the market, the holding period,\nand other factors, ETF shares can be less\ncostly than futures contracts. In addition,\nETF shares can be purchased for smaller sums\nand offer exposure to market sectors and\nstyles for which there is no suitable or\nliquid futures contract. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may also purchase ETF shares\nfor other purposes, including improving its\nability to track its underlying index, and may\ninvest in shares of ETFs that are advised by\nBFA. Short-Term Instruments and Temporary\nInvestments. The Fund and the Underlying Funds\nmay invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, on an\nongoing basis to provide liquidity or for\nother reasons. Money market instruments are\ngenerally short-term investments that may\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) shares of\nmoney market funds (including those advised by\nBFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit,\nbankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed-time deposits and\nother obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks\n(including non-U.S. branches) and similar\ninstitutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at\nthe date of purchase, \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by Moody's,\n\u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch, or \u201c A-1 \u201d by Standard &\nPoor's \u00ae Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary\nof S&P Global, Inc. ( \u201c S&P Global Ratings \u201d\n), or if unrated, of comparable quality as\ndetermined by BFA; (v) non-convertible\ncorporate debt securities ( e.g. , bonds and\ndebentures) with remaining maturities at the\ndate of purchase of not more than 397 days and\nthat have been determined to present minimal\ncredit risks, in accordance with the\nrequirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the\n1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and\n(vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated\nobligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S.\nbranches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of\ncomparable quality to obligations of U.S.\nbanks that may be purchased by the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds. Any of these instruments may\nbe purchased on a current or forward-settled\nbasis. Time deposits are non-negotiable\ndeposits maintained in banking institutions\nfor specified periods of time at stated\ninterest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances are time\ndrafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers,\nusually in connection with international\ntransactions. Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign\nObligations. Certain of the Underlying Funds\nmay invest in sovereign obligations. An\ninvestment in sovereign debt obligations\ninvolves special risks not present in\ncorporate debt obligations. Sovereign debt\nincludes securities issued or guaranteed by a\nforeign sovereign government. The issuer of\nthe sovereign debt that controls the repayment\nof the debt may be unable or unwilling to\nrepay principal or interest when due, and an\nUnderlying Fund may have limited recourse in\nthe event of a default. Similar to other\nissuers, changes to the financial condition or\ncredit rating of a non-U.S. government may\ncause the value of a sovereign debt to\ndecline. During periods of economic\nuncertainty, the market prices of sovereign\ndebt obligations may be more volatile than\nprices of U.S. debt obligations, which may\naffect an Underlying Fund's NAV. Several\nsovereign issuers have experienced volatility\nand adverse trends due to concerns about\nrising government debt levels, including\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. A\nsovereign debtor's willingness or ability to\nrepay principal and pay interest in a timely\nmanner may be affected by, among other\nfactors, its cash flow situation, the extent\nof its non-U.S. currency reserves, the\navailability of sufficient foreign exchange,\nthe relative size of the debt service burden,\nthe sovereign debtor's policy toward principal\ninternational lenders and local political\nconstraints. The failure of a sovereign debtor\nto implement economic reforms, achieve\nspecified levels of economic performance or\nrepay principal or interest when due may\nresult in the cancellation of third-party\ncommitments to lend funds to the sovereign\ndebtor, which may further impair such debtor's\nability or willingness to service its debts.\n\n14\n\nSupranational Entities. Certain of the\nUnderlying Funds may invest in debt securities\nof supranational entities. Examples of such\nentities include the International Bank for\nReconstruction and Development (the World\nBank), the European Steel and Coal Community,\nthe Asian Development Bank and the Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank. The government\nmembers, or \u201c stockholders, \u201d usually make\ninitial capital contributions to the\nsupranational entity and in many cases are\ncommitted to make additional capital\ncontributions if the supranational entity is\nunable to repay its borrowings. There is no\nguarantee that one or more stockholders of a\nsupranational entity will continue to make any\nnecessary additional capital contributions. If\nsuch contributions are not made, the entity\nmay be unable to pay interest or repay\nprincipal on its debt securities, and the\nUnderlying Fund may lose money on such\ninvestments. Swap Agreements. Swap agreements\nare contracts between parties in which one\nparty agrees to make periodic payments to the\nother party based on a pre-determined\nunderlying investment or notional amount. In\nreturn, the other party agrees to make\nperiodic payments to the first party based on\nthe return (or a differential in rate of\nreturn) earned or realized on the underlying\ninvestment or notional amount. Swap agreements\nwill usually be performed on a net basis, with\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund receiving or\npaying only the net amount of the two\npayments. The net amount of the excess, if\nany, of the Fund's or such Underlying Fund\u2019s\nobligations over its entitlements with respect\nto each swap is accrued on a daily basis. The\nFund and the Underlying Funds may enter into\nswap agreements, including currency swaps,\ninterest rate swaps and index swaps. The use\nof swaps is a highly specialized activity that\ninvolves investment techniques and risks\ndifferent from those associated with ordinary\nportfolio security transactions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets. U.S. Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities\nRisk. Certain of the Underlying Funds invest\nin securities backed by pools of mortgages\nissued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or\none of its agencies or sponsored entities,\nincluding Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie\nMac. The market for MBS has been adversely\naffected by the value of those MBS held and/or\nissued by these agencies and sponsored\nentities. If a U.S. government agency or\nsponsored entity issues securities in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests and such issuer is\nunable to meet its obligations or ceases to\nexist, and no plan is made for the repayment\nof securities, the performance of such\nUnderlying Fund will be adversely impacted.\nGinnie Mae . Established in 1968, Ginnie Mae\nis a wholly owned U.S. government corporation\nwithin the U.S. Department of Housing and\nUrban Development. Ginnie Mae is authorized to\nguarantee, with the backing of the full faith\nand credit of the U.S. government, the timely\npayment of principal and interest on\nsecurities issued by the institutions approved\nby Ginnie Mae (such as savings and loan\ninstitutions, commercial banks and mortgage\nbanks), and backed by pools of mortgages\ninsured by the Federal Housing Administration\nor guaranteed by the U.S. Department of\nVeterans Affairs. Ginnie Mae securities also\nare supported by the authority of Ginnie Mae\nto borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment to make payments under its\nguarantee. Any actual or potential disruption\nto Ginnie Mae, or the financial condition or\ncredit of the U.S. government, could cause the\nvalue of Ginnie Mae securities to decline. In\n2011, S&P Global Ratings downgraded U.S.\nTreasury securities from AAA rating to AA+\nrating. A further downgrade of the ratings of\nU.S. government debt obligations, which are\noften used as a benchmark for other borrowing\narrangements, could result in higher interest\nrates for individual and corporate borrowers,\ncause disruptions in the international bond\nmarkets and have a substantial negative effect\non the U.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S.\nTreasury securities from another ratings\nagency or a further downgrade below AA+ rating\nby S&P Global Ratings may cause the value of\nGinnie Mae securities to decline. Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac . Fannie Mae was established\nas a federal agency in 1938 and in 1968 was\nchartered by Congress as a private\nshareholder-owned company. Securities issued\nby Fannie Mae are guaranteed as to timely\npayment of principal and interest by Fannie\nMae. The securities are not backed by or\nentitled to the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. government, but are supported by the\nright of Fannie Mae to borrow from the U.S.\nTreasury Department. Freddie Mac is a\nstockholder-owned corporation chartered by\nCongress in 1970. Securities issued by Freddie\nMac entitle the holder to timely payment of\ninterests, which is guaranteed by Freddie Mac.\nFreddie Mac also guarantees either ultimate\ncollection or timely payment of all principal\npayments. While Freddie Mac generally does not\nguarantee timely payment of principal, Freddie\nMac may remit the amount due on account of its\nguarantee of ultimate payment of principal at\nany time after default on an underlying\nmortgage, but in no event later than one year\nafter it becomes payable. The securities are\nnot backed by or entitled to the full faith\nand credit of the U.S. government or by any\nFederal Home Loan Banks, but are supported by\nthe right of Freddie Mac to borrow from the\nU.S. Treasury Department. In 2008, the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency placed each of Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac into government\nconservatorship in an effort to provide\nstability in the financial markets and put the\ngovernment-sponsored entities in sound and\nsolvent\n\n15\n\ncondition. In addition, the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment agreed to provide Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac up to $100 billion of capital each\non an as needed basis to ensure that they\ncontinue to provide liquidity to the housing\nand mortgage markets. Mortgage-Backed\nSecurities . MBS issued or guaranteed by the\nU.S. government or one of its agencies or\nsponsored entities, such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie\nMae, or Freddie Mac, represent interests in\npools of mortgages in which payments of both\nprincipal and interest on the securities are\ngenerally made monthly, in effect \u201c passing\nthrough \u201d the payments made by borrowers on\nthe mortgage loans that underlie the\nsecurities (net of any fees paid to the issuer\nor guarantor of the securities). MBS differ\nfrom other forms of debt securities, which\nnormally provide for periodic payment of\ninterest in fixed amounts with principal\npayments at maturity or specified call dates,\nwhile a MBS payments provide a combination of\ninterest and principal throughout the a bond\u2019s\nterm. As further described below, MBS may be\nstructured as pass-through securities or\ncollateralized mortgage obligations ( \u201c CMOs \u201d\n). MBS are subject to the general risks\nassociated with investing in real estate\nsecurities; that is, they may lose value if\nthe value of the underlying real estate to\nwhich a pool of mortgages relates declines. In\naddition, investments in MBS involve certain\nspecific risks. These risks include the\nfailure of a party to meet its commitments\nunder the related operative documents, adverse\ninterest rate changes and the effects of\nprepayments on mortgage cash flows. The value\nof MBS, like that of traditional fixed-income\nsecurities, typically increases when interest\nrates fall and decreases when interest rates\nrise. However, MBS differ from traditional\nfixed-income securities because of their\npotential for prepayment without penalty. The\nprice paid by an Underlying Fund for its MBS,\nthe yield an Underlying Fund expects to\nreceive from such securities and the weighted\naverage life of the securities are based on a\nnumber of factors, including the anticipated\nrate of prepayment of the underlying\nmortgages. In a period of declining interest\nrates, borrowers may prepay the underlying\nmortgages more quickly than anticipated,\nthereby reducing the yield to maturity and the\naverage life of the MBS. Moreover, when an\nUnderlying Fund reinvests the proceeds of a\nprepayment in these circumstances, it will\nlikely receive a rate of interest that is\nlower than the rate on the security that was\nprepaid. To the extent that an Underlying Fund\npurchases MBS at a premium, mortgage\nforeclosures and principal prepayments may\nresult in a loss to the extent of the premium\npaid. If an Underlying Fund buys such\nsecurities at a discount, both scheduled\npayments of principal and unscheduled\nprepayments will increase current and total\nreturns and will accelerate the recognition of\nincome, which, when distributed to\nshareholders, will be taxable as ordinary\nincome. In a period of rising interest rates,\nprepayments of the underlying mortgages may\noccur at a slower than expected rate, creating\nmaturity extension risk. This particular risk\nmay effectively change a security that was\nconsidered short- or intermediate-term at the\ntime of purchase into a long-term security.\nSince the value of long-term securities\ngenerally fluctuates more widely in response\nto changes in interest rates than that of\nshorter-term securities, maturity extension\nrisk could increase the inherent volatility of\nan Underlying Fund. Under certain interest\nrate and prepayment scenarios, an Underlying\nFund may fail to recoup fully its investment\nin MBS notwithstanding any direct or indirect\nU.S. governmental or agency guarantee.\nMortgage Pass-Through Securities . Some MBS,\nsuch as U.S. agency mortgage pass-through\nsecurities, represent a right to receive\nprincipal and interest payments collected on a\npool of mortgages, which are passed through to\nsecurity holders. In the basic mortgage pass-\nthrough structure, mortgages with similar\nissuer, term and coupon characteristics are\ncollected and aggregated into a \u201c pool \u201d\nconsisting of multiple mortgage loans. The\npool is assigned a CUSIP number and undivided\ninterests in the pool are traded and sold as\npass-through securities. The holder of the\nsecurity is entitled to a pro rata share of\nprincipal and interest payments (including\nunscheduled prepayments) from the pool of\nmortgage loans. An investment in a specific\npool of mortgage pass-through securities\nrequires an analysis of the specific\nprepayment risk of mortgages within the\ncovered pool (since mortgagors typically have\nthe option to prepay their loans). The level\nof prepayments on a pool of MBS is difficult\nto predict and can impact the subsequent cash\nflows, value and yield of the mortgage pool.\nIn addition, when trading specific mortgage\npools, precise execution, delivery and\nsettlement arrangements must be negotiated for\neach transaction. To-Be-Announced Securities .\nCertain of the Underlying Funds may seek to\ngain exposure to U.S. agency mortgage pass-\nthrough securities by investing in to-be-\nannounced ( \u201c TBA \u201d ) securities. \u201c TBAs \u201d\nrefer to a commonly used mechanism for the\nforward settlement of U.S. agency MBS, and not\nto a separate type of MBS. Most transactions\nin fixed-rate MBS occur through the use of TBA\ntransactions. TBA transactions generally are\nconducted in accordance with widely-accepted\nguidelines which establish commonly observed\nterms and conditions for execution,\nsettlement, and delivery. In a TBA\ntransaction, the buyer and seller decide on\ngeneral trade parameters, such as the issuing\nagency, settlement date, par amount, and\nprice. The actual mortgage pools delivered\ngenerally are determined two days prior to\nsettlement date. An\n\n16\n\nUnderlying Fund may regularly enter into TBA\nagreements and \u201c roll over \u201d such agreements\nprior to the settlement date stipulated in\nsuch agreements. This type of TBA transaction\nis sometimes known as a \u201c TBA roll. \u201d In a TBA\nroll, an Underlying Fund generally will sell\nthe obligation to purchase the pools\nstipulated in the TBA agreement prior to the\nstipulated settlement date and will enter into\na new TBA agreement for future delivery of\npools of MBS. In addition, an Underlying Fund\nmay enter into TBA agreements and settle such\ntransactions on the stipulated settlement date\nby accepting actual receipt or delivery of the\npools of MBS stipulated in the TBA agreement.\nThe Underlying Funds intend to invest cash\npending settlement of TBA transactions in\nmoney market instruments, repurchase\nagreements, or other high quality, liquid\nshort-term instruments, including money market\nfunds advised by BFA. An Underlying Fund will\npay its pro rata share of fees and expenses of\nany money market fund that it may invest in,\nin addition to the Underlying Fund\u2019s own fees\nand expenses. Collateralized Mortgage\nObligations . U.S. agency MBS may also be\nstructured in the form of CMOs. CMOs are\ncreated by dividing the principal and interest\npayments collected on a pool of mortgages into\nseveral revenue streams ( \u201c tranches \u201d ) with\ndifferent priority rights to portions of the\nunderlying mortgage payments. Certain CMO\ntranches may represent a right to receive\ninterest only, principal only, or an amount\nthat remains after floating-rate tranches are\npaid (an \u201c inverse floater \u201d ). These\nsecurities are frequently referred to as \u201c\nmortgage derivatives \u201d and may be extremely\nsensitive to changes in interest rates.\nInterest rates on inverse floaters, for\nexample, vary inversely with a short-term\nfloating rate (which may be reset\nperiodically). Interest rates on inverse\nfloaters will decrease when short-term rates\nincrease and will increase when short-term\nrates decrease. These securities have the\neffect of providing a degree of investment\nleverage. In response to changes in market\ninterest rates or other market conditions, the\nvalue of an inverse floater may increase or\ndecrease at a multiple of the increase or\ndecrease in the value of the underlying\nsecurities. If an Underlying Fund invests in\nCMO tranches issued by U.S. government\nagencies or sponsored entities and interest\nrates move in a manner not anticipated by BFA,\nit is possible that the Underlying Fund could\nlose all or substantially all of its\ninvestment. Certain CMOs in which an\nUnderlying Fund may invest may also provide a\ndegree of investment leverage, which could\ncause the Underlying Fund to lose all or\nsubstantially all of its investment. U.S.\nGovernment Obligations. Certain of the\nUnderlying Funds may invest in various types\nof U.S. government obligations. U.S.\ngovernment obligations are a type of bond and\ninclude securities issued or guaranteed as to\nprincipal and interest by the U.S. government,\nits agencies or instrumentalities. Payment of\nprincipal and interest on U.S. government\nobligations (i) may be backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. or (ii) may be\nbacked solely by the issuing or guaranteeing\nagency or instrumentality itself (as with\nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHLB notes). In\nthe latter case, the Underlying Fund must look\nprincipally to the agency or instrumentality\nissuing or guaranteeing the obligation for\nultimate repayment, which agency or\ninstrumentality may be privately owned. There\ncan be no assurance that the U.S. government\nwould provide financial support to its\nagencies or instrumentalities where it is not\nobligated to do so. As a general matter, the\nvalue of debt instruments, including U.S.\ngovernment obligations, declines when market\ninterest rates increase and rises when market\ninterest rates decrease. Certain types of U.S.\ngovernment obligations are subject to\nfluctuations in yield or value due to their\nstructure or contract terms. Future\nDevelopments. The board of the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may, in the future, authorize\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund to invest in\nsecurities contracts and investments, other\nthan those listed in this SAI and in the\nProspectus, provided they are consistent with\nthe Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investment\nobjective and do not violate any of its\ninvestment restrictions or policies. General\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of some\nof the principal risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. Because the Fund expects to obtain\nits exposure to the securities in the\nUnderlying Index substantially through its\ninvestment in the Underlying Funds,\nshareholders should be aware that the risks of\ninvestment in particular types of securities,\neconomic sectors and geographic locations\ndiscussed below may be borne by the Fund\nthrough its investment in the Underlying\nFunds. Through its investment in the\nUnderlying Funds, the Fund will also bear the\nrisks described below associated with the\nUnderlying Funds' use of portfolio management\ntechniques, such as borrowing arrangements and\nuse of derivatives, in addition to the risks\nassociated with those activities if the Fund\nengages in them directly.\n\n17\n\nAn investment in the Fund should be made with\nan understanding that the value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities, including its investment\nin the Underlying Funds, may fluctuate in\naccordance with changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuers of the portfolio\nsecurities, the value of stocks in general,\nand other factors that affect the market. The\norder of the below risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any particular\nrisk factor. Borrowing Risk. Borrowing may\nexaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares\nand in the return on the Fund\u2019s portfolio.\nBorrowing will cause the Fund to incur\ninterest expense and other fees. The costs of\nborrowing may reduce the Fund\u2019s return.\nBorrowing may cause the Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to\ndo so to satisfy its obligations. Custody\nRisk. Custody risk refers to the risks\ninherent in the process of clearing and\nsettling trades and to the holding of\nsecurities, cash and other assets by local\nbanks, agents and depositories. Low trading\nvolumes and volatile prices in less developed\nmarkets make trades harder to complete and\nsettle, and governments or trade groups may\ncompel local agents to hold securities in\ndesignated depositories that may not be\nsubject to independent evaluation. Local\nagents are held only to the standards of care\nof their local markets, and thus may be\nsubject to limited or no government oversight.\nCommunications between the U.S. and emerging\nmarket countries may be unreliable, increasing\nthe risk of delayed settlements or losses of\nsecurity certificates. In general, the less\ndeveloped a country\u2019s securities market is,\nthe greater the likelihood of custody\nproblems. Practices in relation to the\nsettlement of securities transactions in\nemerging markets involve higher risks than\nthose in developed markets, in part because of\nthe use of brokers and counterparties that are\noften less well capitalized, and custody and\nregistration of assets in some countries may\nbe unreliable. The possibility of fraud,\nnegligence or undue influence being exerted by\nthe issuer or refusal to recognize ownership\nexists in some emerging markets, and, along\nwith other factors, could result in ownership\nregistration being lost. In addition, the laws\nof certain countries may put limits on an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s ability to recover its\nassets if a foreign bank or depository or\nissuer of a security or an agent of any of the\nforegoing goes bankrupt. Such Underlying Fund\nwould absorb any loss resulting from such\ncustody problems and may have no successful\nclaim for compensation. Illiquid Investments\nRisk. The Fund may not acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that the Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without significantly changing the market\nvalue of the investment. The liquidity of an\ninvestment will be determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment\nspecific considerations as set out in the\nLiquidity Program as required by the Liquidity\nRule. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and the Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of the Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Issuer Insolvency\nRisk. The Fund's and the Underlying Funds'\npotential exposure to financially or\noperationally troubled issuers involves a high\ndegree of credit and market risk, which may be\nheightened during an economic downturn or\nrecession. Should an issuer of securities held\nby the Fund or an Underlying Fund become\ninvolved in a bankruptcy proceeding,\nreorganization or financial restructuring, a\nwide variety of considerations make an\nevaluation of the outcome of the Fund\u2019s or\nsuch Underlying Fund's exposure to the issuer\nuncertain. During the period of a bankruptcy\nproceeding, reorganization or financial\nrestructuring, it is unlikely that the Fund or\nthe Underlying Funds will receive any interest\npayments on the securities of the issuer. The\nFund or the Underlying Funds will be subject\nto significant uncertainty as to whether the\nreorganization or restructuring will be\ncompleted, and the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds may bear certain extraordinary expenses\nto protect and recover its investment. The\nFund or the Underlying Funds will also be\nsubject to significant uncertainty as to when\nand in what manner and for what value the\nobligations evidenced by the securities of the\nissuer held by the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds will eventually be satisfied. Even if a\nplan of reorganization or restructuring is\nadopted with respect to the securities of the\nissuer held by the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds, there can be no assurance that the\nsecurities or other assets received by the\nFund or the Underlying Funds in connection\nwith such plan of reorganization or\nrestructuring will not have a lower value or\nincome potential than may have been\nanticipated or no value. The Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds may be unable to enforce\ntheir claims or rights in any collateral or\nmay have its claims or security interest in\nany collateral challenged, disallowed or\nsubordinated to the claims or security\ninterests of other creditors. In addition,\namendments to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or\nother relevant laws could alter the expected\noutcome or introduce greater uncertainty\nregarding the outcome of the Fund's or an\nUnderlying Fund's securities holdings in the\nissuer. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a\nreorganization or restructuring, the\nsecurities of the issuer held by the Fund or\nthe Underlying Funds could be re-\ncharacterized, or the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds may receive\n\n18\n\ndifferent securities or other assets,\nincluding equity securities. These types of\nequity securities include, but are not limited\nto: common stock; preferred stock (including\nconvertible preferred stock); bonds, notes and\ndebentures convertible into common or\npreferred stock; stock purchase warrants and\nrights; equity interests in trusts; and\ndepositary receipts. The value of equity\nsecurities received by the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds could decline if the\nfinancial condition of the issuer deteriorates\nor if overall market and economic conditions,\nor conditions within the issuer\u2019s region or\nindustry, deteriorate. Equity securities\nreceived by the Fund or an Underlying Fund\nthrough a bankruptcy proceeding,\nreorganization or restructuring of an issuer\nwould not be component securities of the\nFund\u2019s or the Underlying Fund's Underlying\nIndex, which could subject the Fund or the\nUnderlying Fund to additional tracking error\nrisk. To the extent that the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds receive other assets in\nconnection with a bankruptcy proceeding,\nreorganization or financial restructuring, the\nFund or the Underlying Funds may also be\nsubject to additional risks associated with\nthe assets received. One example of assets\nthat the Fund or the Underlying Funds could\nreceive is an interest in one or more loans\nmade to the issuer as part of a workout agreed\nto by a consortium of lienholders and\ncreditors of the issuer. The Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds may receive such interests in\nloans to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.\nSecurities or other assets received in a\nreorganization or restructuring typically\nentail a higher degree of risk than\ninvestments in securities of issuers that have\nnot undergone a reorganization or\nrestructuring and may be subject to heavy\nselling or downward pricing pressure after\ncompletion of the reorganization or\nrestructuring. The post-\nreorganization/restructuring assets and\nsecurities may also be illiquid and difficult\nto sell or value. If the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds participate in negotiations\nwith respect to a plan of reorganization or\nrestructuring with respect to securities of\nthe issuer held by the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds, the Fund or the Underlying Funds also\nmay be restricted from disposing such\nsecurities for a period of time. If the Fund\nor the Underlying Funds become involved in\nsuch proceedings, the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds may have more active participation in\nthe affairs of the issuer than that assumed\ngenerally by an investor. Money Market\nInstruments Risk. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund may hold money market instruments. The\nvalue of money market instruments may be\naffected by changes in interest rates or in\nthe credit ratings of the investments, among\nother things. If a significant amount of the\nFund's assets is invested in money market\ninstruments, it may be more difficult for the\nFund to achieve its investment objective. An\ninvestment in a money market fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. It is possible to lose money by\ninvesting in a money market fund. Money market\nfunds other than U.S. government money market\nfunds and retail money market funds \u201c float \u201d\ntheir NAV instead of using a stable $1.00 per\nshare price. Operational Risk. BFA and the\nFund's other service providers may experience\ndisruptions or operating errors such as\nprocessing errors or human errors, inadequate\nor failed internal or external processes, or\nsystems or technology failures, that could\nnegatively impact the Fund. While service\nproviders are required to have appropriate\noperational risk management policies and\nprocedures, their methods of operational risk\nmanagement may differ from the Fund\u2019s in the\nsetting of priorities, the personnel and\nresources available or the effectiveness of\nrelevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring\nand oversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect\nthe Fund or to develop processes and controls\nto completely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Reference Rate\nReplacement Risk. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund may be exposed to financial instruments\nthat recently transitioned from, or continue\nto be tied to, the London Interbank Offered\nRate ( \u201c LIBOR \u201d ) to determine payment\nobligations, financing terms, hedging\nstrategies or investment value. The United\nKingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority ( \u201c FCA\n\u201d ), which regulates LIBOR, has ceased\npublishing all LIBOR settings. In April 2023,\nhowever, the FCA announced that some USD LIBOR\nsettings will continue to be published under a\nsynthetic methodology until September 30, 2024\nfor certain legacy contracts. The Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which\nis a broad measure of the cost of borrowing\ncash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities in the repurchase agreement market,\nhas been used increasingly on a voluntary\nbasis in new instruments and transactions.\nUnder U.S. regulations that implement a\nstatutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR,\nbenchmark rates based on SOFR have replaced\nLIBOR in different categories of financial\ncontracts. Neither the effect of the LIBOR\ntransition process nor its ultimate success\ncan yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-\nbased instruments may contemplate a scenario\nwhere LIBOR is no longer available by\nproviding for an alternative rate-setting\nmethodology, there may be significant\nuncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any\nsuch alternative methodologies to replicate\nLIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may have alternative rate-setting\nprovisions and there remains\n\n19\n\nuncertainty regarding the willingness and\nability of issuers to add alternative rate-\nsetting provisions in certain existing\ninstruments. Parties to contracts, securities,\nor other instruments using LIBOR may disagree\non transition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may have instruments linked to\nother interbank offered rates that may also\ncease to be published in the future. Risk of\nDerivatives. A derivative is a financial\ncontract, the value of which depends on, or is\nderived from, the value of an underlying\nasset, such as a security, a commodity (such\nas gold or silver), a currency or an index (a\nmeasure of value or rates, such as the S&P 500\nor the prime lending rate). The Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds may invest in variable rate\ndemand notes and obligations and tender option\nbonds, which may be considered derivatives.\nCompared to securities, derivatives can be\nmore sensitive to changes in interest rates or\nto sudden fluctuations in market prices and\nthus the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's losses\nmay be greater if it invests in derivatives\nthan if it invests only in conventional\nsecurities. Derivatives are also subject to\ncounterparty risk, which is the risk that the\nother party in the transaction will not\nfulfill its contractual obligations.\nDerivatives generally involve the incurrence\nof leverage. When a derivative is used as a\nhedge against a position that the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund holds or is committed to\npurchase, any loss generated by the derivative\ngenerally should be substantially offset by\ngains on the hedged investment, and vice\nversa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate\nlosses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains,\nand in some cases, hedging can cause losses\nthat are not offset by gains, and the Fund or\nan Underlying Fund will recognize losses on\nboth the investment and the hedge. Hedges are\nsometimes subject to imperfect matching\nbetween the derivative and the underlying\nsecurity, and there can be no assurance that\nthe Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's hedging\ntransactions, which entail additional\ntransaction costs, will be effective. Risk of\nFutures and Options on Futures Transactions.\nThere are several risks accompanying the\nutilization of futures contracts and options\non futures contracts. A position in futures\ncontracts and options on futures contracts may\nbe closed only on the exchange on which the\ncontract was made (or a linked exchange).\nWhile each Underlying Fund plans to utilize\nfutures contracts only if an active market\nexists for such contracts, there is no\nguarantee that a liquid market will exist for\nthe contract at a specified time. Furthermore,\nbecause, by definition, futures contracts\nproject price levels in the future and not\ncurrent levels of valuation, market\ncircumstances may result in a discrepancy\nbetween the price of the bond index future and\nthe movement in the relevant underlying\nindexes. In the event of adverse price\nmovements, an Underlying Fund would continue\nto be required to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if an Underlying Fund has\ninsufficient cash, it may have to sell\nportfolio securities to meet daily margin\nrequirements at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. In addition, an\nUnderlying Fund may be required to deliver the\ninstruments underlying the futures contracts\nit has sold. The risk of loss in trading\nfutures contracts or uncovered call options in\nsome strategies ( e.g. , selling uncovered\nbond index futures contracts) is potentially\nunlimited. Each Underlying Fund does not plan\nto use futures and options contracts in this\nway. The risk of a futures position may still\nbe large as traditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. Each Underlying Fund, however,\nintends to utilize futures and options\ncontracts in a manner designed to limit its\nrisk exposure to levels comparable to a direct\ninvestment in the types of bonds in which it\ninvests. Utilization of futures and options on\nfutures by an Underlying Fund involves the\nrisk of imperfect or even negative correlation\nto its underlying index if the index\nunderlying the futures contract differs from\nthe underlying index. There is also the risk\nof loss by an Underlying Fund of margin\ndeposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom such Underlying Fund has an\nopen position in the futures contract or\noption. The purchase of put or call options\nwill be based upon predictions by BFA as to\nanticipated trends, which predictions could\nprove to be incorrect. Because the futures\nmarket generally imposes less burdensome\nmargin requirements than the securities\nmarket, an increased amount of participation\nby speculators in the futures market could\nresult in price fluctuations. Certain\nfinancial futures exchanges limit the amount\nof fluctuation permitted in futures contract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\nlimit establishes the maximum amount by which\nthe price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day's\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of\n\n20\n\nfutures positions and subjecting an Underlying\nFund to substantial losses. In the event of\nadverse price movements, an Underlying Fund\nwould be required to make daily cash payments\nof variation margin. Risk of Investing in\nNon-U.S. Agency Debt Securities.\nUncollateralized bonds issued by agencies,\nsubdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign\ngovernments are generally backed only by the\ncreditworthiness and reputation of the\nentities issuing the bonds and may not be\nbacked by the full faith and credit of the\nforeign government. Moreover, a foreign\ngovernment that explicitly provides its full\nfaith and credit to a particular entity may\nbe, due to changed circumstances, unable or\nunwilling to actually provide that support. If\na non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its\nobligations, the performance of the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund will be adversely impacted. A\nnon-U.S. agency\u2019s operations and financial\ncondition are influenced by the foreign\ngovernment\u2019s economic and other policies.\nChanges to the financial condition or credit\nrating of a foreign government may cause the\nvalue of debt issued by that particular\nforeign government\u2019s agencies, subdivisions or\ninstrumentalities to decline. During periods\nof economic uncertainty, the trading of\nnon-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while\nmarket prices may be more volatile than prices\nof U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks\nassociated with non-U.S. agency investing\ninclude differences in accounting, auditing\nand financial reporting standards, adverse\nchanges in investment or exchange control\nregulations, political instability, which\ncould affect U.S. investments in foreign\ncountries and cause restrictions on the flow\nof international capital. Risk of Investing in\nNon-U.S. Debt Securities. Non-U.S. debt\nsecurities are traded on foreign exchanges and\nOTC in the respective countries covered by\ncertain of the Underlying Funds. The risks of\ninvesting in non-U.S. debt securities\ntypically include market fluctuations caused\nby such factors as economic and political\ndevelopments, changes in interest rates and\nperceived trends in bond prices. Investing in\na fund whose portfolio contains securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers involves certain risks and\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the securities of U.S. issuers.\nThese risks include securities markets that\nmay lack sufficient liquidity or may be less\nefficient; generally greater price volatility;\nless publicly available information about\nissuers; the imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; the imposition of restrictions on\nthe expatriation of funds or other assets of\nthe Underlying Funds; higher transaction and\ncustody costs; delays and risks attendant in\nsettlement procedures; difficulties in\nenforcing contractual obligations; lower\nliquidity and significantly smaller market\ncapitalization of most non-U.S. securities\nmarkets; different accounting and disclosure\nstandards; lower levels of regulation of the\nsecurities markets; more substantial\ngovernment interference with the economy;\nhigher rates of inflation; greater social,\neconomic, and political uncertainty; the risk\nof nationalization or expropriation of assets;\nand different bankruptcy and insolvency\nregimes which may stay or prevent recovery in\nthe event of an issuer\u2019s default. Risk of\nInvesting in Africa. Investments in securities\nof issuers in certain African countries\ninvolve heightened risks including, among\nothers, expropriation and/or nationalization\nof assets, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict, civil war, and social\ninstability as a result of religious, ethnic\nand/or socio-economic unrest or widespread\noutbreaks of disease and, in certain\ncountries, genocidal warfare. Certain\ncountries in Africa generally have less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries, and, consequently,\nthe risks of investing in foreign securities\nare magnified in such countries. Because\nsecurities markets of countries in Africa are\ngenerally underdeveloped and are generally\nless correlated to global economic cycles than\nthose markets located in more developed\ncountries, securities markets in African\ncountries are subject to greater risks\nassociated with market volatility, lower\nmarket capitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations and uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets. Moreover,\ntrading on African securities markets may be\nsuspended altogether. Market volatility may\nalso be heightened by the actions of a small\nnumber of investors. Brokerage firms in\ncertain countries in Africa may be fewer in\nnumber and less established than brokerage\nfirms in more developed markets. Since the\nFund and the Underlying Funds may need to\neffect securities transactions through these\nbrokerage firms, the Fund and the Underlying\nFunds are subject to the risk that these\nbrokerage firms will not be able to fulfill\ntheir obligations to the Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds ( i.e., counterparty risk).\nThis risk is magnified to the extent that the\nFund and the Underlying Funds effect\nsecurities transactions through a single\nbrokerage firm or a small number of brokerage\nfirms. Certain governments in African\ncountries restrict or control to varying\ndegrees the ability of foreign investors to\ninvest in securities of issuers located or\noperating in those countries. Moreover,\ncertain countries in Africa require\ngovernmental approval or special licenses\nprior to investment by foreign investors and\nmay limit the amount of investment by foreign\ninvestors in a particular industry and/or\nissuer, and may limit such foreign investment\nto a certain class of securities of an\n\n21\n\nissuer that may have less advantageous rights\nthan the classes available for purchase by\ndomestic investors of the countries and/or\nimpose additional taxes on foreign investors.\nA delay in obtaining a government approval or\na license would delay investments in a\nparticular country, and, as a result, the Fund\nor the Underlying Funds may not be able to\ninvest in certain securities while approval is\npending. The government of a particular\ncountry may also withdraw or decline to renew\na license that enables the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds to invest in such country.\nThese factors make investing in issuers\nlocated or operating in countries in Africa\nsignificantly riskier than investing in\nissuers located or operating in more developed\ncountries, and any one of these factors could\ncause a decline in the value of the Fund's and\nan Underlying Fund's investments. Issuers\nlocated or operating in countries in Africa\nare generally not subject to the same rules\nand regulations as issuers located or\noperating in more developed countries.\nTherefore, there may be less financial and\nother information publicly available with\nregard to issuers located or operating in\ncountries in Africa and such issuers are\ngenerally not subject to the uniform\naccounting, auditing and financial reporting\nstandards applicable to issuers located or\noperating in more developed countries. In\naddition, governments of certain countries in\nAfrica in which the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds may invest may levy withholding or other\ntaxes on income such as dividends, interest\nand realized capital gains. Although in\ncertain countries in Africa a portion of these\ntaxes are recoverable, the non-recovered\nportion of foreign withholding taxes will\nreduce the income received from investments in\nsuch countries. Investment in countries in\nAfrica may be subject to a greater degree of\nrisk associated with governmental approval in\nconnection with the repatriation of investment\nincome, capital or the proceeds of sales of\nsecurities by foreign investors. In addition,\nthere is the risk that if an African country\u2019s\nbalance of payments declines, such African\ncountry may impose temporary restrictions on\nforeign capital remittances. Consequently, the\nFund or the Underlying Funds could be\nadversely affected by delays in, or a refusal\nto grant, required governmental approval for\nrepatriation of capital, as well as by the\napplication to the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds of any restrictions on investments.\nAdditionally, investments in countries in\nAfrica may require the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds to adopt special procedures, seek local\ngovernment approvals or take other actions,\neach of which may involve additional costs to\nthe Fund or the Underlying Funds. Securities\nlaws in many countries in Africa are\nrelatively new and unsettled and,\nconsequently, there is a risk of rapid and\nunpredictable change in laws regarding foreign\ninvestment, securities regulation, title to\nsecurities and shareholder rights.\nAccordingly, foreign investors may be\nadversely affected by new or amended laws and\nregulations. In addition, there may be no\nsingle centralized securities exchange on\nwhich securities are traded in certain\ncountries in Africa and the systems of\ncorporate governance to which issuers located\nin countries in Africa are subject may be less\nadvanced than those systems to which issuers\nlocated in more developed countries are\nsubject, and, therefore, shareholders of\nissuers located in such countries may not\nreceive many of the protections available to\nshareholders of issuers located in more\ndeveloped countries. Even in circumstances\nwhere adequate laws and shareholder rights\nexist, it may not be possible to obtain swift\nand equitable enforcement of the law. In\naddition, the enforcement of systems of\ntaxation at federal, regional and local levels\nin countries in Africa may be inconsistent and\nsubject to sudden change. Certain countries in\nAfrica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. Certain countries in Africa\ndepend to a significant extent upon exports of\nprimary commodities such as gold, silver,\ncopper and diamonds. These countries therefore\nare vulnerable to changes in commodity prices,\nwhich may be affected by a variety of factors.\nIn addition, certain issuers located in\ncountries in Africa in which the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds invests may operate in, or\nhave dealings with, countries subject to\nsanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S.\ngovernment and the United Nations, and/or\ncountries identified by the U.S. government as\nstate sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an\nissuer may sustain damage to its reputation if\nit is identified as an issuer which operates\nin, or has dealings with, such countries. The\nFund or an Underlying Fund, as an investor in\nsuch issuers, will be indirectly subject to\nthose risks. The governments of certain\ncountries in Africa may exercise substantial\ninfluence over many aspects of the private\nsector and may own or control many companies.\nFuture government actions could have a\nsignificant effect on the economic conditions\nin such countries, which could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments that could adversely affect\ninvestments in certain countries in Africa.\nSome countries in Africa may be affected by a\ngreater degree of public corruption and crime,\nincluding organized crime.\n\n22\n\nPolitical instability and protests in North\nAfrica and the Middle East have caused and may\nin the future cause significant disruptions to\nmany industries. In addition, the outbreak of\nEbola in Western Africa severely challenged\nhealth care industries in those countries and\nadversely impacted the region\u2019s economy due to\nquarantines and disruptions of trade, which\nhas further increased instability in the\nregion. This instability has demonstrated that\npolitical and social unrest can spread quickly\nthrough the region, and that developments in\none country can influence the political events\nin neighboring countries. Some protests have\nturned violent, and civil war and political\nreconstruction in certain countries such as\nLibya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to\ninvestments in the region. Continued political\nand social unrest in these regions, including\nthe ongoing warfare and terrorist activities\nin the Middle East and Africa, may negatively\naffect the value of an investment in the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund. Risk of Investing in\nAsia. Investments in securities of issuers in\ncertain Asian countries involve risks not\ntypically associated with investments in\nsecurities of issuers in other regions. Such\nheightened risks include, among others,\nexpropriation and/or nationalization of\nassets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of\nintellectual property, data and other security\nbreaches (especially of data stored\nelectronically), political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision-making,\narmed conflict and social instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or socio-\neconomic unrest. Certain Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid rates of economic growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, and there\nis no assurance that these rates of economic\ngrowth and industrialization will be\nmaintained. Certain Asian countries have\ndemocracies with relatively short histories,\nwhich may increase the risk of political\ninstability. These countries have faced\npolitical and military unrest, and further\nunrest could present a risk to their local\neconomies and securities markets. Indonesia\nand the Philippines have each experienced\nviolence and terrorism, which has negatively\nimpacted their economies. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect Asian issuers that\nrely on the U.S. for trade. Political,\nreligious, and border disputes persist in\nIndia. India has recently experienced and may\ncontinue to experience civil unrest and\nhostilities with certain of its neighboring\ncountries. Increased political and social\nunrest in these geographic areas could\nadversely affect the performance of\ninvestments in this region. Certain\ngovernments in this region administer prices\non several basic goods, including fuel and\nelectricity, within their respective\ncountries. Certain governments may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector in their respective countries\nand may own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in this\nregion, which in turn could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments adversely affecting investments\nin the region. Corruption and the perceived\nlack of a rule of law in dealings with\ninternational companies in certain Asian\ncountries may discourage foreign investment\nand could negatively impact the long-term\ngrowth of certain economies in this region. In\naddition, certain countries in the region are\nexperiencing high unemployment and corruption,\nand have fragile banking sectors. Some\neconomies in this region are dependent on a\nrange of commodities, including oil, natural\ngas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly\naffected by international commodity prices and\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. The market\nfor securities in this region may also be\ndirectly influenced by the flow of\ninternational capital, and by the economic and\nmarket conditions of neighboring countries.\nChina is a key trading partner of many Asian\ncountries and any changes in trading\nrelationships between China and other Asian\ncountries may affect the region as a whole.\nAdverse economic conditions or developments in\nneighboring countries may increase investors'\nperception of the risk of investing in the\nregion as a whole, which may adversely impact\nthe market value of the securities issued by\ncompanies in the region. Risk of Investing in\nAustralasia. The economies of Australasia,\nwhich include Australia and New Zealand, are\ndependent on exports from the agricultural and\nmining sectors. This makes Australasian\neconomies susceptible to fluctuations in the\ncommodity markets. Australasian economies are\nalso increasingly dependent on their growing\nservice and tourism industries. Australia and\nNew Zealand are located in a part of the world\nthat has historically been prone to natural\ndisasters, such as drought and flooding. Any\nsuch event in the future could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the economies of\nAustralia and New Zealand and affect the value\nof securities held by the relevant Underlying\nFund. The economies of Australia and New\nZealand are dependent on trading with certain\nkey trading partners, including Asia and the\nU.S. Economic\n\n23\n\nevents in the U.S., Asia, or in other key\ntrading countries can have a significant\neconomic effect on the Australasian economies.\nThe economies of Australia and New Zealand are\nheavily dependent on the mining sector.\nPassage of new regulations limiting foreign\nownership of companies in the mining sector or\nimposition of new taxes on profits of mining\ncompanies may dissuade foreign investment, and\nas a result, have a negative impact on\ncompanies to which a Underlying Fund has\nexposure. Risk of Investing in Central and\nSouth America. The economies of certain\ncountries in which certain of the Underlying\nFunds invest are affected by the economies of\nother Central and South American countries,\nsome of which have experienced high interest\nrates, economic volatility, inflation,\ncurrency devaluations, government defaults,\nhigh unemployment rates and political\ninstability which can adversely affect issuers\nin these countries. In addition, commodities\n(such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a\nsignificant percentage of the region's exports\nand many economies in this region are\nparticularly sensitive to fluctuations in\ncommodity prices. Adverse economic events in\none country may have a significant adverse\neffect on some or all of the countries in\nwhich an Underlying Fund invests. The\ngovernments of certain countries in Central\nand South America may exercise substantial\ninfluence over many aspects of the private\nsector and may own or control many companies.\nFuture government actions could have a\nsignificant effect on the economic conditions\nin such countries, which could have a negative\nimpact on the securities in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests. Diplomatic\ndevelopments may also adversely affect\ninvestments in certain countries in Central\nand South America. Some countries in Central\nand South America may be affected by public\ncorruption and crime, including organized\ncrime. Certain countries in Central and South\nAmerica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. In addition, certain issuers\nlocated in countries in Central and South\nAmerica in which the Underlying Funds invest\nmay be the subject of sanctions (for example,\nthe U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain\nVenezuelan individuals, corporate entities and\nthe Venezuelan government) or have dealings\nwith countries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its\nreputation if it is identified as an issuer\nthat has dealings with such countries. The\nFund or an Underlying Fund may be adversely\naffected if it invests in such issuers. Risk\nof Investing in China. Investments in\nsecurities of companies domiciled in China\ninvolve a high degree of risk and special\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the U.S. securities markets. Such\nheightened risks include, among others, an\nauthoritarian government, popular unrest\nassociated with demands for improved\npolitical, economic and social conditions, the\nimpact of regional conflict on the economy and\nhostile relations with neighboring countries.\nMilitary conflicts, either in response to\ninternal social unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries, could disrupt economic development.\nThe Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-\nrunning disagreements and religious and\nnationalist disputes with Tibet and the\nXinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been\ntensions between the Chinese government and\nmany people in Hong Kong who perceive China as\ntightening control over Hong Kong\u2019s semi-\nautonomous liberal political, economic, legal,\nand social framework. Recent protests and\nunrest have increased tensions even further.\nDue to the interconnected nature of the Hong\nKong and Chinese economies, this instability\nin Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong\nKong and Chinese markets. China has a complex\nterritorial dispute regarding the sovereignty\nof Taiwan and has made threats of invasion.\nTaiwan-based companies and individuals are\nsignificant investors in China. Military\nconflict between China and Taiwan may\nadversely affect securities of Chinese\nissuers. In addition, China has strained\ninternational relations with Japan, India,\nRussia and other neighbors due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities and other\ndefense concerns. Additionally, China is\nalleged to have participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Actual and\nthreatened responses to such activity and\nstrained international relations, including\npurchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which\nthen Underlying Fund invests. China could be\naffected by military events on the Korean\npeninsula or internal instability within North\nKorea. These situations may cause uncertainty\nin the Chinese market and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the Chinese economy. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, the Chinese government still\nexercises substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol\n\n24\n\nmany companies. Chinese issuers, such as those\nin the financial services or technology\nsectors, and potentially other sectors in the\nfuture, are subject to the risk that Chinese\nauthorities can intervene in their operations\nand structure. The Chinese government\ncontinues to maintain a major role in economic\npolicymaking, and investing in China involves\nrisk of loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments, trading of securities of\nChinese issuers and repatriation of capital\ninvested. A Fund may invest in securities\nissued by variable interest entities ( \u201c VIEs\n\u201d ), which are subject to the investment risks\nassociated with the underlying Chinese\noperating company. A VIE enters into service\ncontracts and other contracts with the Chinese\noperating company, which provide the VIE with\nexposure to the company. Although the VIE has\nno equity ownership of the Chinese operating\ncompany, the contractual arrangements permit\nthe VIE to consolidate the Chinese operating\ncompany into its financial statements.\nIntervention by the Chinese government with\nrespect to VIEs could significantly affect the\nChinese operating company\u2019s performance and\nthe enforceability of the VIE\u2019s contractual\narrangements with the Chinese company. In\naddition, there is less regulation and\nmonitoring of Chinese securities markets and\nthe activities of investors, brokers and other\nparticipants than in the U.S. Accordingly,\nChinese issuers are not subject to the same\ndegree of regulation as are U.S. issuers with\nrespect to such matters as insider trading\nrules, tender offer regulation, accounting\nstandards or auditor oversight, stockholder\nproxy requirements and the requirements\nmandating timely and accurate disclosure of\ninformation. Securities markets in China are\nin the process of change and further\ndevelopment. This may lead to trading\nvolatility, difficulty in the settlement and\nrecording of transactions and difficulty in\ninterpreting and applying the relevant\nregulation. There may be significant obstacles\nto obtaining information necessary for\ninvestigations into or litigation against\nChinese issuers, and investors may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund is not\nactively managed and does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. While the Chinese economy has\nexperienced past periods of rapid growth,\nthere is no assurance that such growth rates\nwill recur. China may experience substantial\nrates of inflation, significant indebtedness\nor economic recessions, causing a negative\neffect on the economy and securities market.\nChina\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on export\ngrowth. Reduction in spending on Chinese\nproducts and services, supply chain\ndiversification, institution of additional\ntariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers\n(including as a result of heightened trade\ntensions between China and the U.S. or in\nresponse to actual or alleged Chinese cyber\nactivity) or a downturn in any of the\neconomies of China\u2019s key trading partners may\nhave an adverse impact on the Chinese economy\nand the companies in which the Fund or\nUnderlying Fund invests. Certain Chinese\ncompanies (which may change from time to time)\nare directly or indirectly subject to economic\nor trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or\nother governments due to national security,\nhuman rights or other concerns of such\ngovernment. For example, certain foreign\ntechnology companies are subject to U.S.\nexport controls as those companies are\nbelieved to pose a risk to U.S. interests. The\nU.S. also bans imports of goods produced in\ncertain regions of China or by certain Chinese\ncompanies due to concerns about forced labor.\nSuch restrictions may have unanticipated and\nadverse effects on the Chinese economy and\ncompanies. Any action that targets Chinese\nfinancial markets or securities exchanges\ncould interfere with orderly trading, delay\nsettlement or cause market disruptions. The\nUnderlying Index of the Fund may include\ncompanies that are subject to economic or\ntrade restrictions (but not investment\nrestrictions) imposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments. So long as these restrictions do\nnot include restrictions on investments, the\nFund is generally expected to invest in such\ncompanies, consistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of its Underlying Index.\nThe tax laws and regulations in the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China ( \u201c PRC \u201d ) are subject to\nchange, including the issuance of\nauthoritative guidance or enforcement,\npossibly with retroactive effect. The\ninterpretation, applicability and enforcement\nof such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as\nconsistent and transparent as those of more\ndeveloped nations, and may vary over time and\nfrom region to region. The application and\nenforcement of PRC tax rules could have a\nsignificant adverse effect on the Fund and its\ninvestors, particularly in relation to capital\ngains withholding tax imposed upon non-\nresidents. In addition, the accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards and\npractices applicable to Chinese companies may\nbe less rigorous, and may result in\nsignificant differences between financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with PRC\naccounting standards and practice and those\nprepared in accordance with international\naccounting standards. Risk of Investing in\nDeveloped Countries. Many countries with\ndeveloped markets have recently experienced\nsignificant economic pressures. These\ncountries generally tend to rely on the\nservices sectors ( e.g. , the financial\nservices sector) as the primary source of\neconomic growth and may be susceptible to the\nrisks of individual service sectors. For\nexample, companies in the financial services\nsector are subject to governmental regulation\nand, recently, government intervention, which\nmay\n\n25\n\nadversely affect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and\namount of capital they must maintain.\nDislocations in the financial sector and\nperceived or actual governmental influence\nover certain financial companies may lead to\ncredit rating downgrades and, as a result,\nimpact, among other things, revenue growth for\nsuch companies. If financial companies\nexperience a prolonged decline in revenue\ngrowth, certain developed countries that rely\nheavily on financial companies as an economic\ndriver may experience a correlative slowdown.\nConcerns have emerged with respect to the\neconomic health of certain developed\ncountries. These concerns primarily stem from\nheavy indebtedness of many developed countries\nand their perceived inability to continue to\nservice high debt loads without simultaneously\nimplementing stringent austerity measures.\nSuch concerns have led to tremendous downward\npressure on the economies of these countries.\nAs a result, it is possible that interest\nrates on debt of certain developed countries\nmay rise to levels that make it difficult for\nsuch countries to service such debt. Spending\non health care and retirement pensions in most\ndeveloped countries has risen dramatically.\nMedical innovation, extended life expectancy\nand higher public expectations are likely to\ncontinue the increase in health care and\npension costs. Any increase in health care and\npension costs will likely have a negative\nimpact on the economic growth of many\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries rely on imports of certain key\nitems, such as crude oil, natural gas, and\nother commodities. As a result, an increase in\ndemand for, or price fluctuations of, certain\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Developed market countries\ngenerally are dependent on the economies of\ncertain key trading partners. Changes in any\none economy may cause an adverse impact on\nseveral developed countries. In addition,\nheavy regulation of, among others, labor and\nproduct markets may have an adverse effect on\ncertain issuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s or an Underlying Fund's\ninvestments. Risk of Investing in Emerging\nMarkets. Certain of the Underlying Funds may\ninvest in emerging market countries, and such\ninvestments may be subject to greater risks\nthan investments in developed countries. These\nrisks include: (i) less social, political, and\neconomic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity\nand price volatility due to smaller or limited\nlocal capital markets for such securities, or\nlow or non-existent trading volumes; (iii)\ncompanies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign\nexchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to\nless scrutiny and regulation by local\nauthorities; (iv) local governments may decide\nto seize or confiscate securities held by\nforeign investors and/or local governments may\ndecide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability\nto make dividend or interest payments; (v)\nlocal governments may limit or entirely\nrestrict repatriation of invested capital,\nprofits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may\nbe subject to local taxation, including on a\nretroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing\nrestrictions on standard payments imposed by\nlocal governments may attempt to make dividend\nor interest payments to foreign investors in\nthe local currency; (viii) there may be\nsignificant obstacles to obtaining information\nnecessary for investigations into or\nlitigation against companies and investors may\nexperience difficulty in enforcing legal\nclaims related to the securities and/or local\njudges may favor the interests of the issuer\nover those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy\njudgments may only be permitted to be paid in\nthe local currency; (x) limited public\ninformation regarding the issuer may result in\ngreater difficulty in determining market\nvaluations of the securities; and (xi) lack of\nfinancial reporting on a regular basis,\nsubstandard disclosure and differences in\naccounting standards may make it difficult to\nascertain the financial health of an issuer.\nThe Underlying Funds do not select investments\nbased on investor protection considerations.\nEmerging market securities markets are\ntypically marked by a high concentration of\nmarket capitalization and trading volume in a\nsmall number of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of ownership of such securities\nby a limited number of investors. In addition,\nbrokerage and other costs associated with\ntransactions in emerging market securities can\nbe higher, sometimes significantly, than\nsimilar costs incurred in securities markets\nin developed countries. Although some emerging\nmarkets have become more established and tend\nto issue securities of higher credit quality,\nthe markets for securities in other emerging\nmarket countries are in the earliest stages of\ntheir development, and these countries issue\nsecurities across the credit spectrum. Even\nthe markets for relatively widely traded\nsecurities in emerging market countries may\nnot be able to absorb, without price\ndisruptions, a significant increase in trading\nvolume or trades of a size customarily\nundertaken by institutional investors in the\nsecurities markets of developed countries. The\nlimited size of many of these securities\nmarkets can cause prices to be erratic for\nreasons apart from factors that affect the\nsoundness and competitiveness of the\nsecurities issuers. For example, prices may be\nunduly influenced by traders who control large\npositions in these markets. Additionally,\nmarket making and arbitrage activities are\ngenerally less extensive in such markets,\nwhich may contribute to increased volatility\nand reduced liquidity of such markets. The\nlimited liquidity of emerging market country\nsecurities may also affect an Underlying\nFund's ability to accurately value its\nportfolio securities or to acquire or dispose\nof securities at the price and time it wishes\nto do so or in order to meet redemption\nrequests. Many emerging market countries\nsuffer from uncertainty and corruption in\ntheir legal frameworks. Legislation may be\ndifficult to interpret and laws may be too new\nto provide any precedential value. Laws\nregarding foreign investment and private\nproperty may be weak or non-existent. Sudden\nchanges in governments may result in policies\nwhich are less\n\n26\n\nfavorable to investors such as policies\ndesigned to expropriate or nationalize \u201c\nsovereign \u201d assets. Certain emerging market\ncountries in the past have expropriated large\namounts of private property, in many cases\nwith little or no compensation, and there can\nbe no assurance that such expropriation will\nnot occur in the future. Investment in the\nsecurities markets of certain emerging market\ncountries is restricted or controlled to\nvarying degrees. These restrictions may limit\nan Underlying Fund's investment in certain\nemerging market countries and may increase the\nexpenses of such Underlying Fund. Certain\nemerging market countries require governmental\napproval prior to investments by foreign\npersons or limit investment by foreign persons\nto only a specified percentage of an issuer's\noutstanding securities or a specific class of\nsecurities which may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\ncompany available for purchase by nationals.\nMany emerging market countries lack the\nsocial, political, and economic stability\ncharacteristic of the U.S. Political\ninstability among emerging market countries\ncan be common and may be caused by an uneven\ndistribution of wealth, social unrest, labor\nstrikes, civil wars, and religious oppression.\nEconomic instability in emerging market\ncountries may take the form of: (i) high\ninterest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation,\nincluding hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of\nunemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes\nin government economic and tax policies,\nincluding confiscatory taxation; and (v)\nimposition of trade barriers. An Underlying\nFund's income and, in some cases, capital\ngains from foreign securities will be subject\nto applicable taxation in certain of the\nemerging market countries in which it invests,\nand treaties between the U.S. and such\ncountries may not be available in some cases\nto reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.\nEmerging markets also have different clearance\nand settlement procedures, and in certain of\nthese emerging markets there have been times\nwhen settlements have been unable to keep pace\nwith the volume of securities transactions,\nmaking it difficult to conduct such\ntransactions. In the past, certain governments\nin emerging market countries have become\noverly reliant on the international capital\nmarkets and other forms of foreign credit to\nfinance large public spending programs, which\nin the past have caused huge budget deficits.\nOften, interest payments have become too\noverwhelming for a government to meet,\nrepresenting a large percentage of total GDP.\nThese foreign obligations have become the\nsubject of political debate and served as fuel\nfor political parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\nRisk of Investing in Europe. Investing in\nEuropean countries exposes the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund to the economic and political\nrisks associated with Europe in general and\nthe specific European countries in which it\ninvests. The economies and markets of European\ncountries are often closely connected and\ninterdependent, and events in one European\ncountry can have an adverse impact on other\nEuropean countries. An Underlying Fund may\nmake investments in securities of issuers that\nare domiciled in, have significant operations\nin, or that are listed on at least one\nsecurities exchange within member states of\nthe European Union (the \u201c EU \u201d ). A number of\ncountries within the EU are also members of\nthe Economic and Monetary Union (the \u201c\neurozone \u201d ) and have adopted the euro as\ntheir currency. Eurozone membership requires\nmember states to comply with restrictions on\ninflation rates, deficits, interest rates,\ndebt levels and fiscal and monetary controls,\neach of which may significantly affect every\ncountry in Europe. Changes in import or export\ntariffs, changes in governmental or EU\nregulations on trade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro and other currencies of\ncertain EU countries which are not in the\neurozone, the default or threat of default by\nan EU member state on its sovereign debt,\nand/or an economic recession in an EU member\nstate may have a significant adverse effect on\nthe economies of other EU member states and\ntheir trading partners. Although certain\nEuropean countries are not in the eurozone,\nmany of these countries are obliged to meet\nthe criteria for joining the eurozone.\nConsequently, these countries must comply with\nmany of the restrictions noted above. The\nEuropean financial markets have experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due to concerns\nabout economic downturns, government debt\nlevels and the possible default of government\ndebt in several European countries, including,\nbut not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus,\nFrance, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal,\nSpain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further\neconomic deterioration, certain countries,\nwithout prior warning, can institute \u201c capital\ncontrols. \u201d Countries may use these controls\nto restrict volatile\n\n27\n\nmovements of capital entering and exiting\ntheir country. Such controls may negatively\naffect an Underlying Fund\u2019s investments. A\ndefault or debt restructuring by any European\ncountry would adversely impact holders of that\ncountry\u2019s debt and sellers of credit default\nswaps linked to that country\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, which may be located in\ncountries other than those listed above. In\naddition, the credit ratings of certain\nEuropean countries were downgraded in the\npast. These events have adversely affected the\nvalue and exchange rate of the euro and may\ncontinue to significantly affect the economies\nof every country in Europe, including\ncountries that do not use the euro and non-EU\nmember states. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central\nbanks and others, including austerity measures\nand reforms, may not produce the desired\nresults, may result in social unrest and may\nlimit future growth and economic recovery or\nhave other unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The impact of these actions, especially if\nthey occur in a disorderly fashion, is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely impact the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investments in the region. The\nUnited Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) left the EU ( \u201c\nBrexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could\nadversely affect European or worldwide\npolitical, regulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute to instability\nin global political institutions, regulatory\nagencies and financial markets. Certain\nEuropean countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect European issuers\nthat rely on the U.S. for trade. The national\npolitics of countries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding for example, secessionist movements.\nThe governments of European countries may be\nsubject to change and such countries may\nexperience social and political unrest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region also could impact financial\nmarkets. The impact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of the Fund's and the Underlying\nFunds' investments. Russian Invasion of\nUkraine . Russia launched a large-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The\nextent and duration of the military action,\nresulting sanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions, including declines in its\nstock markets and the value of the ruble\nagainst the U.S. dollar, are impossible to\npredict, but could be significant. Disruptions\ncaused by Russian military action or other\nactions (including cyberattacks and espionage)\nor resulting actual and threatened responses\nto such activity, including purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts or changes in\nconsumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally. Risk\nof Investing in Frontier Markets. Investments\nin frontier market countries may be subject to\ngreater risks than investments in more\ndeveloped countries. Frontier market countries\nare subject to similar risks as those of\nemerging market countries, but the risks are\nmore pronounced in frontier market countries.\nThese risks include: (i) less social,\npolitical, and economic stability; (ii)\ngreater illiquidity and price volatility due\nto smaller or limited local capital markets\nfor such securities, or low or non-existent\ntrading volumes; (iii) foreign exchanges and\nbroker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny\nand regulation by local authorities; (iv)\nlocal governments may decide to seize or\nconfiscate securities held by foreign\ninvestors and/or local governments may decide\nto suspend or limit an issuer\u2019s ability to\nmake dividend or interest payments; (v) local\ngovernments may limit or entirely restrict\nrepatriation of invested capital, profits, and\ndividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject\nto local taxation, including on a retroactive\nbasis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on\nU.S. dollar or euro payments imposed by local\ngovernments may attempt to make dividend or\ninterest payments to foreign investors in the\nlocal currency; (viii) investors may\nexperience difficulty in enforcing legal\nclaims related to the securities and/or local\njudges may favor the interests of the issuer\nover those of foreign investors; (ix)\nbankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to\nbe paid in the local currency; (x) limited\npublic information regarding the issuer may\nresult in greater difficulty in determining\nmarket valuations of the securities; and (xi)\nlax financial reporting on a regular basis,\nsubstandard disclosure and differences in\naccounting standards may make it difficult to\nascertain the financial health of an issuer.\nFrontier market securities markets are\ntypically marked by a high concentration of\nmarket capitalization and trading volume in a\nsmall number of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of ownership of\n\n28\n\nsuch securities by a limited number of\ninvestors. In addition, brokerage and other\ncosts associated with transactions in frontier\nsecurities markets can be higher, sometimes\nsignificantly, than similar costs incurred in\nsecurities markets in developed countries. The\nmarkets for securities in certain frontier\ncountries are in the earliest stages of their\ndevelopment, and these countries issue\nsecurities across the credit spectrum. Even\nthe markets for relatively widely traded\nsecurities in frontier countries may not be\nable to absorb, without price disruptions, a\nsignificant increase in trading volume or\ntrades of a size customarily undertaken by\ninstitutional investors in the securities\nmarkets of developed countries. The limited\nsize of many of these securities markets can\ncause prices to be erratic for reasons apart\nfrom factors that affect the soundness and\ncompetitiveness of the securities issuers. For\nexample, prices may be unduly influenced by\ntraders who control large positions in these\nmarkets. Additionally, market making and\narbitrage activities are generally less\nextensive in such markets, which may\ncontribute to increased volatility and reduced\nliquidity of such markets. The limited\nliquidity of frontier country securities may\nalso affect an Underlying Fund's ability to\naccurately value its portfolio securities or\nto acquire or dispose of securities at the\nprice and time it wishes to do so or in order\nto meet redemption requests. Many frontier\nmarket countries suffer from uncertainty and\ncorruption in their legal frameworks.\nLegislation may be difficult to interpret and\nlaws may be too new to provide any\nprecedential value. Laws regarding foreign\ninvestment and private property may be weak or\nnon-existent. Sudden changes in governments\nmay result in policies which are less\nfavorable to investors such as policies\ndesigned to expropriate or nationalize \u201c\nsovereign \u201d assets. Certain frontier market\ncountries in the past have expropriated large\namounts of private property, in many cases\nwith little or no compensation, and there can\nbe no assurance that such expropriation will\nnot occur in the future. Foreign investment in\nthe securities markets of certain frontier\ncountries is restricted or controlled to\nvarying degrees. These restrictions may limit\nan Underlying Fund\u2019s investment in certain\nfrontier countries and may indirectly increase\nthe expenses of the Underlying Fund. Certain\nfrontier countries require governmental\napproval prior to investments by foreign\npersons or limit investment by foreign persons\nto only a specified percentage of an issuer\u2019s\noutstanding securities or a specific class of\nsecurities which may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\ncompany available for purchase by nationals.\nMany frontier market countries lack the\nsocial, political, and economic stability\ncharacteristic of the U.S. and other developed\ncountries. Political instability among\nfrontier market countries can be common and\nmay be caused by an uneven distribution of\nwealth, social unrest, labor strikes, civil\nwars, and religious oppression. Economic\ninstability in frontier market countries may\ntake the form of: (i) high interest rates;\n(ii) high levels of inflation, including\nhyperinflation; (iii) high levels of\nunemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes\nin government economic and tax policies,\nincluding confiscatory taxation; and (v)\nimposition of trade barriers. An Underlying\nFund\u2019s income and, in some cases, capital\ngains from foreign securities will be subject\nto applicable taxation in certain of the\nfrontier market countries in which it invests,\nand treaties between the U.S. and such\ncountries may not be available in some cases\nto reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.\nFrontier markets also have different clearance\nand settlement procedures, and in certain of\nthese frontier markets there have been times\nwhen settlements have been unable to keep pace\nwith the volume of securities transactions,\nmaking it difficult to conduct such\ntransactions. In the past, governments within\nthe frontier markets have become overly\nreliant on the international capital markets\nand other forms of foreign credit to finance\nlarge public spending programs, which in the\npast have caused huge budget deficits. Often,\ninterest payments have become too overwhelming\nfor a government to meet, representing a large\npercentage of total GDP. These foreign\nobligations have become the subject of\npolitical debate and served as fuel for\npolitical parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\n\n29\n\nRisk of Investing in the Middle East. Many\nMiddle Eastern countries have little or no\ndemocratic tradition, and the political and\nlegal systems in such countries may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds. Many economies in the Middle East are\nhighly reliant on income from the sale of oil\nand natural gas or trade with countries\ninvolved in the sale of oil and natural gas,\nand their economies are therefore vulnerable\nto changes in the market for oil and natural\ngas and foreign currency values. As global\ndemand for oil and natural gas fluctuates,\nmany Middle Eastern economies may be\nsignificantly impacted. In addition, many\nMiddle Eastern governments have exercised and\ncontinue to exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector. In\ncertain cases, a Middle Eastern country\u2019s\ngovernment may own or control many companies,\nincluding some of the largest companies in the\ncountry. Accordingly, governmental actions in\nthe future could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Middle Eastern\ncountries. This could affect private sector\ncompanies and the Fund or the Underlying\nFunds, as well as the value of securities in\nsuch Underlying Funds' portfolios. Certain\nMiddle Eastern markets are in the earliest\nstages of development. As a result, there may\nbe a high concentration of market\ncapitalization and trading volume in a small\nnumber of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of investors and financial\nintermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern\ncountries typically are fewer in number and\nless capitalized than brokers in the U.S. The\nlegal systems in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries also may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund. For example,\nthe potential liability of a shareholder in a\nU.S. corporation with respect to acts of the\ncorporation generally is limited to the amount\nof the shareholder\u2019s investment. However, the\nnotion of limited liability is less clear in\ncertain Middle Eastern countries. An\nUnderlying Fund therefore may be liable in\ncertain Middle Eastern countries for the acts\nof a corporation in which it invests for an\namount greater than its actual investment in\nthat corporation. Similarly, the rights of\ninvestors in Middle Eastern issuers may be\nmore limited than those of shareholders of a\nU.S. corporation. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain or enforce a legal\njudgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some\nMiddle Eastern countries prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on investments in\ntheir capital markets, particularly their\nequity markets, by foreign entities such as an\nUnderlying Fund. For example, certain\ncountries may require governmental approval\nprior to investment by foreign persons or\nlimit the amount of investment by foreign\npersons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle\nEastern countries may also limit investment by\nforeign persons to only a specific class of\nsecurities of an issuer that may have less\nadvantageous terms (including price) than\nsecurities of the issuer available for\npurchase by nationals of the relevant Middle\nEastern country. The manner in which foreign\ninvestors may invest in companies in certain\nMiddle Eastern countries, as well as\nlimitations on those investments, may have an\nadverse impact on the operations of an\nUnderlying Fund. For example, in certain of\nthese countries, an Underlying Fund may be\nrequired to invest initially through a local\nbroker or other entity and then have the\nshares that were purchased re-registered in\nthe name of such Underlying Fund. Re-\nregistration in some instances may not be\npossible on a timely basis. This may result in\na delay during which an Underlying Fund may be\ndenied certain of its rights as an investor,\nincluding rights as to dividends or to be made\naware of certain corporate actions. There also\nmay be instances where an Underlying Fund\nplaces a purchase order but is subsequently\ninformed, at the time of re-registration, that\nthe permissible allocation of the investment\nto foreign investors has already been filled\nand, consequently, an Underlying Fund may not\nbe able to invest in the relevant company.\nSubstantial limitations may exist in certain\nMiddle Eastern countries with respect to an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s ability to repatriate\ninvestment income or capital gains. An\nUnderlying Fund could be adversely affected by\ndelays in, or a refusal to grant, any required\ngovernmental approval for repatriation of\ncapital, as well as by the application to such\nUnderlying Fund of any restrictions on\ninvestment. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nmay be heavily dependent upon international\ntrade and, consequently, have been and may\ncontinue to be negatively affected by trade\nbarriers, exchange controls, managed\nadjustments in relative currency values and\nother protectionist measures imposed or\nnegotiated by the countries with which they\ntrade. These countries also have been and may\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by economic\nconditions in the countries with which they\ntrade. In addition, certain issuers located in\nMiddle Eastern countries in which an\nUnderlying Fund invests may operate in, or\nhave dealings with, countries subject to\nsanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S.\ngovernment and the United Nations, and/or\ncountries identified by the U.S. government as\nstate sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an\nissuer may sustain damage to its reputation if\nit is identified as an issuer which operates\nin, or has dealings with, such countries. An\nUnderlying Fund, as an investor in such\nissuers, will be indirectly subject to those\nrisks.\n\n30\n\nCertain Middle Eastern countries have strained\nrelations with other Middle Eastern countries\ndue to territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, international alliances, defense\nconcerns or other reasons, which may adversely\naffect the economies of these Middle Eastern\ncountries. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nexperience significant unemployment, as well\nas widespread underemployment. There has also\nbeen a recent increase in recruitment efforts\nand an aggressive push for territorial control\nby terrorist groups in the region, which has\nled to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities.\nWarfare in Syria has spread to surrounding\nareas, including many portions of Iraq and\nTurkey. Such hostilities may continue into the\nfuture or may escalate at any time due to\nethnic, racial, political, religious or\nideological tensions between groups in the\nregion or foreign intervention or lack of\nintervention, among other factors. Risk of\nInvesting in North America. A decrease in\nimports or exports, changes in trade\nregulations or an economic recession in any\nNorth American country can have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire North American\nregion and on some or all of the North\nAmerican countries in which certain of the\nUnderlying Funds invest. The U.S. is Canada's\nand Mexico's largest trading and investment\npartner. The Canadian and Mexican economies\nare significantly affected by developments in\nthe U.S. economy. Since the implementation of\nthe North American Free Trade Agreement ( \u201c\nNAFTA \u201d ) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and\nMexico, total merchandise trade among the\nthree countries has increased. However,\npolitical developments including the\nimplementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the\nrenegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the\nUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ( \u201c\nUSMCA \u201d ), which replaced NAFTA on July 1,\n2020, could negatively affect North America\u2019s\neconomic outlook and, as a result, the value\nof securities held by an Underlying Fund.\nPolicy and legislative changes in one country\nmay have a significant effect on North\nAmerican markets generally, as well as on the\nvalue of certain securities held by an\nUnderlying Fund. Risk of Investing in Russia.\nInvesting in the Russian securities market\ninvolves a high degree of risk and special\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the U.S. securities market, and\nshould be considered highly speculative. Risks\ninclude: the absence of developed legal\nstructures governing private and foreign\ninvestments and private property; the\npossibility of the loss of all or a\nsubstantial portion of an Underlying Fund\u2019s\nassets invested in Russia as a result of\nexpropriation; certain national policies which\nmay restrict the Underlying Fund\u2019s investment\nopportunities, including, without limitation,\nrestrictions on investing in issuers or\nindustries deemed sensitive to relevant\nnational interests; and potentially greater\nprice volatility in, significantly smaller\ncapitalization of, and relative illiquidity\nof, the Russian market. There can also be no\nassurance that an Underlying Fund\u2019s\ninvestments in the Russian securities market\nwould not be expropriated, nationalized or\notherwise confiscated. In the event of the\nsettlement of any such claims or such\nexpropriation, nationalization or other\nconfiscation, an Underlying Fund could lose\nits entire investment. In addition, it may be\ndifficult and more costly to obtain and\nenforce a judgment in the Russian court\nsystem. Russia may also be subject to a\ngreater degree of economic, political and\nsocial instability than is the case in other\ndeveloped countries. Such instability may\nresult from, among other things, the\nfollowing: (i) an authoritarian government or\nmilitary involvement in political and economic\ndecision-making, including changes in\ngovernment through extra-constitutional means;\n(ii) popular unrest associated with demands\nfor improved political, economic and social\nconditions; (iii) internal insurgencies; (iv)\nhostile relations, including armed conflict,\nwith neighboring countries; and (v) ethnic,\nreligious and racial disaffection. The Russian\neconomy is heavily dependent upon the export\nof a range of commodities including most\nindustrial metals, forestry products and oil\nand gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected\nby international commodity prices and is\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. Any acts of\nterrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or\ninternationally could have an adverse effect\non the financial and commodities markets and\nthe global economy. As Russia produces and\nexports large amounts of crude oil and gas,\nany acts of terrorism or armed conflict\ncausing disruptions of Russian oil and gas\nexports could negatively affect the Russian\neconomy and, thus, adversely affect the\nfinancial condition, results of operations or\nprospects of related companies. Current and\nfuture economic sanctions may also adversely\naffect the Russian oil, banking, mining,\nmetals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among\nother sectors. The Russian government may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in Russia, which could\nhave a negative impact on private sector\ncompanies. There is also the possibility of\ndiplomatic developments that could adversely\naffect investments in Russia. In recent years,\nthe Russian government has begun to take\nbolder steps to re-assert its regional\ngeopolitical influence (including military\nsteps) and launched a large-scale invasion of\nUkraine on February 24, 2022. Additionally,\nRussia is alleged to have participated in\nstate-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign\n\n31\n\ngovernments. Such steps have increased\ntensions between Russia and its neighbors and\nWestern countries and may negatively affect\neconomic growth. Actual and threatened\nresponses by other nation-states to Russia\u2019s\nalleged cyber activity may have an adverse\nimpact on the Russian economy and the Russian\nissuers of securities in which an Underlying\nFund invests. For example, the U.S. has added\ncertain foreign technology companies to the\nU.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of\nIndustry and Security\u2019s \u201c Entity List, \u201d which\nis a list of companies believed to pose a\nnational security risk to the U.S. Actions\nlike these may have unanticipated and\ndisruptive effects on the Russian economy.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia\u2019s\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich an Underlying Fund invests, or the\neconomies of Europe as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian military\naction may also impact the markets for certain\nRussian commodities, such as oil and natural\ngas, as well as other sectors of the Russian\neconomy, and are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across Europe and\nglobally. Russia Sanctions . Governments in\nthe U.S. and many other countries\n(collectively, the \u201c Sanctioning Bodies \u201d )\nhave imposed economic sanctions on certain\nRussian individuals, including politicians,\nand Russian corporate and banking entities,\nincluding banning Russia from global payments\nsystems that facilitate cross-border payments.\nThe Sanctioning Bodies, or others, could also\ninstitute broader sanctions on Russia. These\nsanctions, or even the threat of further\nsanctions, may result in the decline of the\nvalue and liquidity of Russian securities, a\nweakening of the ruble or other adverse\nconsequences to the Russian economy. These\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Russian securities and/or funds\ninvested in prohibited assets, impairing the\nability of an Underlying Fund to buy, sell,\nreceive or deliver those securities and/or\nassets. Recently, Russia has issued a number\nof countersanctions, some of which restrict\nthe distribution of profits by limited\nliability companies ( e.g. , dividends), and\nprohibits Russian persons from entering into\ntransactions with designated persons from \u201c\nunfriendly states \u201d as well as the export of\nraw materials or other products from Russia to\ncertain sanctioned persons. The sanctions\nagainst certain Russian issuers include\nprohibitions on transacting in or dealing in\nissuances of debt or equity of such issuers.\nCompliance with each of these sanctions has\nand may continue to impair the ability of an\nUnderlying Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive or\ndeliver the affected securities or other\nsecurities of such issuers. If it becomes\nimpracticable or unlawful for an Underlying\nFund to hold securities subject to, or\notherwise affected by, sanctions\n(collectively, \u201c affected securities \u201d ), or\nif deemed appropriate by BFA, an Underlying\nFund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the\naffected securities in connection with\ncreation transactions and instead require a\ncash deposit, which may also increase an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s transaction costs. An\nUnderlying Fund may also be legally required\nto freeze assets in a blocked account.\nSanctions have resulted in Russia taking\ncounter measures or retaliatory actions, which\nhas impaired the value and liquidity of\nRussian securities. These retaliatory measures\ninclude the immediate freeze of Russian assets\nheld by an Underlying Fund. Due to such a\nfreeze of these assets, including depositary\nreceipts, an Underlying Fund may need to\nliquidate non-restricted assets in order to\nsatisfy any Fund redemption orders. The\nliquidation of Fund assets during this time\nmay also result in an Underlying Fund\nreceiving substantially lower prices for its\nsecurities. Russia may implement additional\nretaliatory measures, which may further impair\nthe value and liquidity of Russian securities\nand the ability of the Fund to receive\ndividend payments. Recently, Russia has issued\na number of countersanctions, some of which\nrestrict the distribution of profits by\nlimited liability companies ( e.g. ,\ndividends), and prohibits Russian persons from\nentering into transactions with designated\npersons from \u201c unfriendly states \u201d as well as\nthe export of raw materials or other products\nfrom Russia to certain sanctioned persons.\nRussian companies may be unable to pay\ndividends and, if they pay dividends, the Fund\nmay be unable to receive them. These\nsanctions, the decision by Russia to suspend\ntrading on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and\nprohibit non-resident investors from executing\nsecurity sales, and other events have led to\nchanges in certain of the Underlying Indexes\nof the Underlying Funds. The Underlying Fund\u2019s\nIndex Providers have removed Russian\nsecurities where present in an Underlying\nIndex of an Underlying Fund. To the extent\nthat an Underlying Fund rebalances its\nportfolio and trades in non-Russian securities\nto seek to track the investment results of its\nUnderlying Index, this may result in\ntransaction costs and increased tracking\nerror. The Underlying Funds are currently\nrestricted from trading in Russian securities,\nincluding those in their portfolios, while an\nUnderlying Fund's Underlying Index has removed\nRussian securities. For Underlying Funds with\nRussian\n\n32\n\nsecurities, this disparity will also lead to\nincreased tracking error. The inability of an\nUnderlying Fund to trade in Russian securities\nmay adversely affect an Underlying Fund\u2019s\nability to meet its investment objective. It\nis unknown when, or if, sanctions may be\nlifted or an Underlying Fund\u2019s ability to\ntrade in Russian securities will resume. Also,\nif an affected security is included in an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s Underlying Index, an\nUnderlying Fund may, where practicable, seek\nto eliminate its holdings of the affected\nsecurity by employing or augmenting its\nrepresentative sampling strategy to seek to\ntrack the investment results of its Underlying\nIndex. The use of (or increased use of) a\nrepresentative sampling strategy may increase\nan Underlying Fund\u2019s tracking error risk. If\nthe affected securities constitute a\nsignificant percentage of the Underlying\nIndex, an Underlying Fund may not be able to\neffectively implement a representative\nsampling strategy, which may result in\nsignificant tracking error between an\nUnderlying Fund\u2019s performance and the\nperformance of its Underlying Index. Risk of\nInvesting in Saudi Arabia. The Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index includes Saudi Arabian\nsecurities. The ability of foreign investors\n(such as the Fund) to invest in the securities\nof Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new.\nSuch ability could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership in such securities. In\naddition, the Capital Market Authority ( \u201c CMA\n\u201d ) places investment limitations on the\nownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers by foreign investors, including a\nlimitation on the Fund\u2019s ownership of the\nsecurities of any single issuer listed on the\nSaudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may\nprevent the Fund from investing in accordance\nwith its strategy and contribute to tracking\nerror against the Underlying Index. These\nrestrictions may be changed or new\nrestrictions, such as licensing requirements,\nspecial approvals or additional foreign taxes,\nmay be instituted at any time. The Fund may\nnot be able to obtain or maintain any such\nlicenses or approvals and may not be able to\nbuy and sell securities at full value. Major\ndisruptions or regulatory changes could occur\nin the Saudi Arabian market, any of which\ncould negatively impact the Fund. These risks\nmay be exacerbated, compared to more developed\nmarkets, given the limited history of foreign\ninvestment in the Saudi Arabian market.\nInvestments in Saudi Arabia may also be\nsubject to loss due to expropriation or\nnationalization of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on additional\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital. Such heightened risks may include,\namong others, restrictions on and government\nintervention in international trade,\nconfiscatory taxation, political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision making,\narmed conflict, crime and instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has\nprivatized, or has begun the process of\nprivatizing, certain entities and industries.\nNewly privatized companies may face strong\ncompetition from government-sponsored\ncompetitors that have not been privatized. In\nsome instances, investors in newly privatized\nentities have suffered losses due to the\ninability of the newly privatized entities to\nadjust quickly to a competitive environment or\nchanging regulatory and legal standards or, in\nsome cases, due to re-nationalization of such\nprivatized entities. There is no assurance\nthat similar losses will not recur. Saudi\nArabia is highly reliant on income from the\nsale of petroleum and trade with other\ncountries involved in the sale of petroleum,\nand its economy is therefore vulnerable to\nchanges in foreign currency values and the\nmarket for petroleum, as well as acts\ntargeting petroleum production or processing\nfacilities in Saudi Arabia. As global demand\nfor petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be\nsignificantly impacted. In the recent past,\nthe Saudi Arabian government has explored\nprivatization and diversification of the\neconomy in the wake of a diminished petroleum\nmarket. Like most Middle Eastern governments,\nthe government of Saudi Arabia exercises\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector. Although liberalization in the\nwider economy is underway, in many areas it\nhas lagged significantly: restrictions on\nforeign ownership persist, and the government\nhas an ownership stake in many key industries.\nThe situation is exacerbated by the fact that\nSaudi Arabia is governed by an absolute\nmonarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Incidents involving a Middle Eastern\ncountry\u2019s or the region\u2019s security, including\nterrorism, may cause uncertainty in their\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. Governmental\nactions in the future could have a significant\neffect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia,\nwhich could affect private sector companies\nand the Fund, as well as the value of\nsecurities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio. Any\neconomic sanctions on Saudi Arabian\nindividuals or Saudi Arabian corporate\nentities, or even the threat of sanctions, may\nresult in the decline of the value and\nliquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a\nweakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse\nconsequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. Any\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Saudi Arabian securities and/or\nfunds investing in prohibited assets,\nimpairing the ability of the Fund to buy,\nsell, receive or deliver those securities\nand/or assets. In addition, Saudi Arabia\u2019s\neconomy relies heavily on cheap, foreign\nlabor, and changes in the availability of this\nlabor supply could have an adverse effect on\nthe economy.\n\n33\n\nThe securities markets in Saudi Arabia may not\nbe as developed as those in other countries.\nAs a result, securities markets in Saudi\nArabia are subject to greater risks associated\nwith market volatility, lower market\ncapitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations, uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets, governmental\ncontrol and heavy regulation of labor and\nindustry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian\ncompanies tend to trade less frequently than\nthose of companies on exchanges in more\ndeveloped markets. Such infrequent trading may\nadversely affect the pricing of these\nsecurities and the Fund\u2019s ability to sell\nthese securities in the future. Although the\npolitical situation in Saudi Arabia is largely\nstable, Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced political instability, and there\nremains the possibility that the stability\nwill not hold in the future or that\ninstability in the larger Middle East region\ncould adversely impact the economy of Saudi\nArabia. Instability may be caused by military\ndevelopments, government interventions in the\nmarketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes,\nattempted social or political reforms,\nreligious differences, or other factors.\nAdditionally, anti-Western views held by\ncertain groups in the Middle East may\ninfluence government policies regarding\nforeign investment. Further developments in\nU.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other\nMiddle-Eastern countries may affect these\nattitudes and policies. The U.S. is a\nsignificant trading partner of, or foreign\ninvestor in, Saudi Arabia. As a result,\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be\nparticularly affected by changes in the U.S.\neconomy. A decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, new trade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar\nexchange rate or an economic slowdown in the\nU.S. may have a material adverse effect on the\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a\nresult, securities to which the Fund has\nexposure. Political instability in North\nAfrica and the larger Middle East region has\ncaused significant disruptions to many\nindustries. Continued political and social\nunrest in these areas may negatively affect\nthe value of securities in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Certain issuers located in Saudi\nArabia may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain\ndamage to its reputation if it is identified\nas an issuer which operates in, or has\ndealings with, such countries. The Fund, as an\ninvestor in such issuers, will be indirectly\nsubject to those risks. Risk of Investing in\nthe Basic Materials Industry. Issuers in the\nbasic materials industry could be adversely\naffected by commodity price volatility,\ninflation, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, import controls and\nincreased competition. Companies in the basic\nmaterials industry may be subject to swift\nfluctuations in supply and demand.\nFluctuations may be caused by events relating\nto political and economic developments, the\nenvironmental impact of basic materials\noperations, and the success of exploration\nprojects. Production of industrial materials\noften exceeds demand as a result of over-\nbuilding or economic downturns, leading to\npoor investment returns. Issuers in the basic\nmaterials industry are at risk for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims and may be adversely affected by\ndepletion of resources, delays in technical\nprogress, labor relations, tax and government\nregulations related to changes to, among other\nthings, energy and environmental policies.\nRisk of Investing in the Capital Goods\nIndustry. Companies in the capital goods\nindustry may be affected by fluctuations in\nthe business cycle and by other factors\naffecting manufacturing demands. Companies in\nthe capital goods industry depend heavily on\ncorporate spending. Companies in the capital\ngoods industry may perform well during times\nof economic expansion, and as economic\nconditions worsen, the demand for capital\ngoods may decrease due to weakening demand,\nworsening business cash flows, tighter credit\ncontrols and deteriorating profitability.\nDuring times of economic volatility, corporate\nspending may fall and adversely affect the\ncapital goods industry. This industry may also\nbe affected by changes in interest rates,\ncorporate tax rates and other government\npolicies. Many capital goods are sold\ninternationally and such companies are subject\nto market conditions in other countries and\nregions. Risk of Investing in the Consumer\nCyclical Industry. Certain Underlying Funds\nmay invest in consumer cyclical companies,\nwhich rely heavily on business cycles and\neconomic conditions. Consumer cyclical\ncompanies include automotive manufacturers,\nretail companies, and housing-related\ncompanies. The consumer cyclical industry can\nbe significantly affected by several factors,\nincluding, without limitation, the performance\nof domestic and international economies,\nexchange rates, changing consumer tastes and\ntrends, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue\ngeneration, consumer confidence, commodity\nprice volatility, labor relations, interest\nrates, import and export controls, intense\ncompetition, technological developments and\ngovernment regulation.\n\n34\n\nRisk of Investing in the Consumer Services\nIndustry. The success of firms in the consumer\nservices industry and certain retailers\n(including food and beverage, general\nretailers, media, and travel and leisure) is\ntied closely to the performance of the\ndomestic and international economy, interest\nrates, exchange rates, competition and\nconsumer confidence. The consumer services\nindustry depends heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer spending.\nCompanies in the consumer services industry\nmay be subject to severe competition, which\nmay also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Companies in the consumer\nservices industry are facing increased\ngovernment and regulatory scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or regulatory\naction. Changes in demographics and consumer\npreferences may affect the success of consumer\nservice providers. Risk of Investing in the\nConsumer Staples Sector. Companies in the\nconsumer staples sector may be adversely\naffected by changes in the global economy,\nconsumer spending, competition, demographics\nand consumer preferences, and production\nspending. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may also be affected by changes in\nglobal economic, environmental and political\nevents, economic conditions, the depletion of\nresources, and government regulation. For\ninstance, government regulations may affect\nthe permissibility of using various food\nadditives and production methods of companies\nthat make food products, which could affect\ncompany profitability. In addition, tobacco\ncompanies may be adversely affected by the\nadoption of proposed legislation and/or by\nlitigation. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector also may be subject to risks pertaining\nto the supply of, demand for and prices of raw\nmaterials. The prices of raw materials\nfluctuate in response to a number of factors,\nincluding, without limitation, changes in\ngovernment agricultural support programs,\nexchange rates, import and export controls,\nchanges in international agricultural and\ntrading policies, and seasonal and weather\nconditions. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Risk of Investing in the Energy\nSector. Companies in the energy sector are\nstrongly affected by the changes in and\nvolatility of global energy prices, energy\nsupply and demand, government regulations and\npolicies, energy production and conservation\nefforts, technological change, development of\nalternative energy sources, and other factors\nthat they cannot control. Energy companies may\nhave relatively high levels of debt and may be\nmore likely to restructure their businesses if\nthere are downturns in energy markets or in\nthe global economy. If an energy company in an\nUnderlying Fund's portfolio becomes\ndistressed, such Underlying Fund could lose\nall or a substantial portion of its\ninvestment. The energy sector is cyclical and\nis highly dependent on commodity prices.\nPrices and supplies of energy may fluctuate\nsignificantly over short and long periods of\ntime due to, among other things, national and\ninternational political changes, Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries ( \u201c OPEC \u201d )\npolicies, changes in relationships among OPEC\nmembers and between OPEC and oil-importing\nnations, the regulatory environment, taxation\npolicies, the enactment or cessation of trade\nsanctions, war or other geopolitical\nconflicts, and the economies of key energy-\nconsuming countries. Companies in the energy\nsector may be adversely affected by terrorism,\ncyber incidents, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophes. Companies in the energy sector\nare at risk of liability from accidents\nresulting in injury, loss of life or property,\npollution or other environmental damage\nclaims. Significant oil and gas deposits are\nlocated in emerging markets countries where\ncorruption and security may raise significant\nrisks, in addition to the other risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets. Additionally,\nthe Middle East, where many companies in the\nenergy sector may operate, has experienced\nconflict and unrest. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be adversely affected by\nchanges in exchange rates, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, tax treatment, government\nregulation and intervention, negative\nperception, efforts at energy conservation and\nworld events in the regions in which the\ncompanies operate ( e.g ., expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital, military coups, social unrest,\nviolence or labor unrest). Because a\nsignificant portion of revenues of companies\nin this sector is derived from a relatively\nsmall number of customers that are largely\ncomposed of governmental entities and\nutilities, governmental budget constraints may\nhave a significant impact on companies in this\nsector. The energy sector is highly regulated.\nEntities operating in the energy sector are\nsubject to significant regulation of nearly\nevery aspect of their operations by\ngovernmental agencies. Such regulation can\nchange rapidly or over time in both scope and\nintensity. Stricter laws, regulations or\nenforcement policies could be enacted, which\nwould likely increase compliance costs and may\nmaterially adversely affect the financial\nperformance of companies in the energy sector.\nThe energy sector may experience significant\nmarket volatility. For example, Russia\u2019s\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022 led to further disruptions and\nincreased volatility in the energy and\ncommodity futures markets due to actual and\npotential disruptions in the supply and demand\nfor certain commodities, including oil and\nnatural gas. The U.S. and other actors have\nenacted various sanctions and restrictions on\nbusiness dealings with Russia, which include\nrestrictions on imports of oil, natural gas\nand coal. The effect of the current sanctions\nand restrictions, as well as the extent and\nduration of the Russian military action,\nadditional sanctions and associated market\ndisruptions on the energy sector, are\nimpossible to\n\n35\n\npredict and depend on a number of factors. The\neffect of these events or any related\ndevelopments could be significant and may have\na severe adverse effect on the performance of\nan Underlying Fund. Risk of Investing in the\nFinancials Sector. Companies in the financials\nsector include small, regional and money\ncenter banks, securities brokerage firms,\nasset management companies, savings banks and\nthrift institutions, specialty finance\ncompanies ( e.g. , credit card, mortgage\nproviders), insurance and insurance brokerage\nfirms, consumer finance firms, financial\nconglomerates and foreign banking and\nfinancial companies. Most financial companies\nare subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which limits their activities and\nmay affect their ability to earn a profit from\na given line of business. Government\nregulation may change frequently and may have\nsignificant adverse consequences for companies\nin the financials sector, including effects\nnot intended by the regulation. Direct\ngovernmental intervention in the operations of\nfinancial companies and financial markets may\nmaterially and adversely affect the companies\nin which an Underlying Fund invests, including\nlegislation in many countries that may\nincrease government regulation, repatriation\nand other intervention. The impact of\ngovernmental intervention and legislative\nchanges on any individual financial company or\non the financials sector as a whole cannot be\npredicted. The valuation of financial\ncompanies has been and continues to be subject\nto unprecedented volatility and may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors, including\ninterest rate risk and sovereign debt default.\nCertain financial businesses are subject to\nintense competitive pressures, including\nmarket share and price competition. Financial\ncompanies in foreign countries are subject to\nmarket-specific and general regulatory and\ninterest rate concerns. In particular,\ngovernment regulation in certain foreign\ncountries may include taxes and controls on\ninterest rates, credit availability, minimum\ncapital requirements, bans on short sales,\nlimits on prices and restrictions on currency\ntransfers. In addition, companies in the\nfinancials sector may be the targets of\nhacking and potential theft of proprietary or\ncustomer information or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a material adverse\neffect on their businesses. The profitability\nof banks, savings and loan associations and\nother financial companies is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change; for instance, when interest\nrates go up, the value of securities issued by\nmany types of companies in the financials\nsector generally goes down. In other words,\nfinancial companies may be adversely affected\nin certain market cycles, including, without\nlimitation, during periods of rising interest\nrates, which may restrict the availability and\nincrease the cost of capital, and during\nperiods of declining economic conditions,\nwhich may cause, among other things, credit\nlosses due to financial difficulties of\nborrowers. In addition, general economic\nconditions are important to the operations of\nthese companies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector generally.\nFinancial companies can be highly dependent\nupon access to capital markets, and any\nimpediments to such access, such as adverse\noverall economic conditions or a negative\nperception in the capital markets of a\nfinancial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products.\n\n36\n\nPatents have a limited duration, and, upon\nexpiration, other companies may market\nsubstantially similar \u201c generic \u201d products\nthat are typically sold at a lower price than\nthe patented product, which can cause the\noriginal developer of the product to lose\nmarket share and/or reduce the price charged\nfor the product, resulting in lower profits\nfor the original developer. As a result, the\nexpiration of patents may adversely affect the\nprofitability of these companies. In addition,\nbecause the products and services of many\ncompanies in the healthcare sector affect the\nhealth and well-being of many individuals,\nthese companies are especially susceptible to\nextensive litigation based on product\nliability and similar claims. Healthcare\ncompanies are subject to competitive forces\nthat may make it difficult to raise prices\nand, in fact, may result in price discounting.\nMany new products in the healthcare sector may\nbe subject to regulatory approvals. The\nprocess of obtaining such approvals may be\nlong and costly, which can result in increased\ndevelopment costs, delayed cost recovery and\nloss of competitive advantage to the extent\nthat rival companies have developed competing\nproducts or procedures, adversely affecting\nthe company\u2019s revenues and profitability. In\nother words, delays in the regulatory approval\nprocess may diminish the opportunity for a\ncompany to profit from a new product or to\nbring a new product to market, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on a company\u2019s\nbusiness. Healthcare companies may also be\nstrongly affected by scientific biotechnology\nor technological developments, and their\nproducts may quickly become obsolete. Also,\nmany healthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Technology Sector. Technology\ncompanies are characterized by periodic new\nproduct introductions, innovations and\nevolving industry standards, and, as a result,\nface intense competition, both domestically\nand internationally, which may have an adverse\neffect on profit margins. Companies in the\ntechnology sector are often smaller and less\nexperienced companies and may be subject to\ngreater risks than larger companies; these\nrisks may be heightened for technology\ncompanies in foreign markets. Technology\ncompanies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel. The\nproducts of technology companies may face\nproduct obsolescence due to rapid\ntechnological developments and frequent new\nproduct introduction, changes in consumer and\nbusiness purchasing patterns, unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for\nthe services of qualified personnel. In\naddition, a rising interest rate environment\ntends to negatively affect companies in the\ntechnology sector because, in such an\nenvironment, those companies with high market\nvaluations may appear less attractive to\ninvestors, which may cause sharp decreases in\nthe companies\u2019 market prices. Companies in the\ntechnology sector are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights. The\nloss or impairment of these rights may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. Companies in the technology sector\nare facing increased government and regulatory\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or regulatory action. The\ntechnology sector may also be adversely\naffected by changes or trends in commodity\nprices, which may be influenced or\ncharacterized by unpredictable factors.\nFinally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the technology sector may\nbe particular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nRisk of Investing in the Telecommunications\nSector. The telecommunications sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of telecommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the\ntelecommunications sector may experience\ndistressed cash flows due to the need to\ncommit substantial capital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in developing new\nproducts and services using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may make the\nproducts and services\n\n37\n\nof certain telecommunications companies\nobsolete. Finally, while all companies may be\nsusceptible to network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the telecommunications\nsector may be particular targets of hacking\nand potential theft of proprietary or consumer\ninformation or disruptions in service, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on their\nbusinesses. Risk of Investing in the\nTransportation Industry. Companies in the\ntransportation industry may be adversely\naffected by changes in the economy, increases\nin fuel and operating costs, labor relations,\ntechnology developments, exchange rates,\ninsurance costs, industry competition and\ngovernment regulation. Companies in the\ntransportation industry are also affected by\nsevere weather events, mass casualty accidents\nor environmental catastrophes, acts of\nterrorism and other similar events that target\nor damage transportation infrastructure or\nvessels, war or risk of war, widespread\ndisruption of technology systems and\nincreasing equipment and operational costs.\nSuch global or regional events and conditions\nmay adversely affect the operations, financial\ncondition and liquidity of companies in the\ntransportation industry and cause insurance\npremiums to increase dramatically or result in\ninsurance coverage becoming unavailable for\ncertain business lines or assets. Securities\nof companies in the transportation industry\nare generally cyclical and occasionally\nsubject to sharp price movements. Risk of\nInvesting in the Utilities Sector. The\nutilities sector may be adversely affected by\nchanging commodity prices, government\nregulation stipulating rates charged by\nutilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax\nlaws, interest rate fluctuations and changes\nin the cost of providing specific utility\nservices. The utilities industry is also\nsubject to potential terrorist attacks,\nnatural disasters and severe weather\nconditions, as well as regulatory and\noperational burdens associated with the\noperation and maintenance of nuclear\nfacilities. Government regulators monitor and\ncontrol utility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility profits. Federal\nlegislation may facilitate the construction of\nelectric transmission lines not only by public\nutilities but also by independent transmission\ndevelopers, which could increase competition\nin the wholesale electricity markets. In\ncertain countries, regulatory authorities may\nalso restrict a company\u2019s access to new\nmarkets, thereby diminishing the company\u2019s\nlong-term prospects. There are substantial\ndifferences among the regulatory practices and\npolicies of various jurisdictions, and any\nregulatory agency may make major shifts in\npolicy from time to time. There is no\nassurance that regulatory authorities will, in\nthe future, grant rate increases.\nAdditionally, existing and possible future\nregulatory legislation may make it even more\ndifficult for utilities to obtain adequate\nrelief. Certain of the issuers of securities\nheld in an Underlying Fund's portfolio may own\nor operate nuclear generating facilities.\nGovernmental authorities may from time to time\nreview existing policies and impose additional\nrequirements governing the licensing,\nconstruction and operation of nuclear power\nplants. Prolonged changes in climate\nconditions can also have a significant impact\non both the revenues of an electric and gas\nutility as well as the expenses of a utility,\nparticularly a hydro-based electric utility.\nThe rates that traditional regulated utility\ncompanies may charge their customers generally\nare subject to review and limitation by\ngovernmental regulatory commissions. Rate\nchanges may occur only after a prolonged\napproval period or may not occur at all, which\ncould adversely affect utility companies when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to a lesser\nextent, equity securities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. As a result,\nsome companies may be forced to defend their\ncore business and may be less profitable.\nDeregulation may also permit a utility company\nto expand outside of its traditional lines of\nbusiness and engage in riskier ventures. Proxy\nVoting Policy For the Fund, the Board has\ndelegated the voting of proxies for the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities to BFA pursuant to the Fund's Proxy\nVoting Policy, and BFA has adopted policies\nand procedures (collectively, the \u201c iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d ) governing proxy\nvoting by accounts managed by BFA, including\nthe Fund. Under the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting\nPolicies, BFA will vote proxies related to\nFund securities in the best interests of the\nFund and its shareholders. From time to time,\na vote may present a conflict between the\ninterests of the Fund\u2019s shareholders, on the\none hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated\nperson of the Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA\nmaintains policies and procedures that are\ndesigned to prevent undue influence on BFA\u2019s\nproxy voting activity that might stem from any\nrelationship between the issuer of a proxy (or\nany dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s\naffiliates, the Fund or the Fund\u2019s affiliates.\nMost conflicts are managed through a\nstructural separation of BFA\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Group from BFA\u2019s employees with\nsales\n\n38\n\nand client responsibilities. In addition, BFA\nmaintains procedures to ensure that all\nengagements with corporate issuers or\ndissident shareholders are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BFA\u2019s\nrelationship with the issuer of the proxy or\nthe dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Fund's portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ended\nJune 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon\nrequest, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Fund's website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, the Fund discloses\non its website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of the Fund\u2019s next\nnet asset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: The Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of the Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to the Fund to\nsettle purchases of the Fund ( i.e. Deposit\nSecurities) or that Authorized Participants\nwould receive from the Fund to settle\nredemptions of the Fund ( i.e. Fund\nSecurities). These files are known as the\nPortfolio Composition File and the Fund Data\nFile (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The Files are\napplicable for the next trading day and are\nprovided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an Authorized Participant or liquidity\nprovider the securities the Fund is willing to\naccept for a creation, and securities that the\nFund will provide on a redemption. BFA\nemployees may also discuss portfolio holdings-\nrelated information with broker/dealers, in\nconnection with settling the Fund\u2019s\ntransactions, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with the disclosure in the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent registration statement. \u2022\nCommunications with Listing Exchanges: From\ntime to time, employees of BFA may discuss\nportfolio holdings information with the\napplicable primary listing exchange for the\nFund as needed to meet the exchange listing\nstandards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFund, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Fund, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain the Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of the Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar\n\n39\n\nquarter-end requires a non-disclosure or\nconfidentiality agreement and approval of the\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer. Portfolio-\nlevel liquidity metrics disclosure subsequent\nto 60 calendar days after calendar quarter-end\nrequires the approval of portfolio management\nand must be disclosed to all parties\nrequesting the information if disclosed to any\nparty. The Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or\nhis delegate may authorize disclosure of\nportfolio holdings information pursuant to the\nabove policy and procedures, subject to\nrestrictions on selective disclosure imposed\nby applicable law. The Board reviews the\npolicy and procedures for disclosure of\nportfolio holdings information at least\nannually. Construction and Maintenance of the\nUnderlying Index A description of the\nUnderlying Index is provided below. With\nrespect to certain underlying indexes of the\niShares funds, BFA or its affiliates have held\ndiscussions with the applicable index provider\nregarding their business interest in licensing\nan index to track a particular market segment\nand conveyed investment concepts and\nstrategies that could be considered for the\nindex. The index provider designed and\nconstituted such indices using concepts\nconveyed by BFA or its affiliates. For certain\nof these indices, the relevant fund may be the\nfirst or sole user of the underlying index. In\nits sole discretion, the index provider\ndetermines the composition of the securities\nand other instruments in such underlying\nindex, the rebalance protocols of the\nunderlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and other instruments in the\nunderlying index, and any updates to the\nmethodology. From time to time, BFA or its\naffiliates may also provide input relating to\npossible methodology changes of such\nunderlying index pursuant to the index\nprovider\u2019s consultation process or pursuant to\nother communications with the index provider.\nMorningstar \u00ae U.S. Bond Market Yield-Optimized\nIndex SM Number of Components: approximately 6\nThe Morningstar \u00ae U.S. Bond Market Yield-\nOptimized Index SM is broadly diversified\nwithin the fixed-income asset class and seeks\nto deliver current income. The Underlying\nIndex consists exclusively of U.S.-listed ETFs\nthat collectively target fixed-income asset\nclass sectors in allocation weights with\ncertain upper limit weights set at a sector\nlevel. As of September 23, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index consisted of 6 constituent\nETFs. Index Construction. The Underlying Index\nis governed by transparent, objective rules\nfor security election, exclusion, rebalancing,\nand adjustments for corporate actions, all of\nwhich are described in the Morningstar U.S.\nBond Market Yield-Optimized Index Rulebook\n(the \u201c Index Rulebook \u201d ). Morningstar, Inc. (\n\u201c Morningstar \u201d ) makes no subjective\ndeterminations related to index composition.\nTo be eligible for inclusion in the Underlying\nIndex, an ETF must track a benchmark that is\nbroadly representative of the asset class and\nbe registered as an investment company under\nthe 1940 Act. It must trade on a U.S.\nexchange; have at least $100 million in AUM,\nat least one year of trading history, and a\nthree-month average daily trading volume of\nmore than 20,000 shares; and meet certain\nasset minimums as elaborated in the Index\nRulebook. The goal of the Underlying Index is\nto represent an allocation strategy to\ndistinct fixed-income sectors between 10% to\n50% for each of the U.S. government and\ngovernment-related, U.S. securitized, and U.S.\ninvestment-grade credit sectors, no more than\n20% for the U.S. non-investment-grade credit\nsector and no more than 10% for the emerging\nmarket debt sector. These five sectors are\nrepresented by the Underlying Funds that, in\naggregate, Morningstar considers to exhibit\nhigh risk-adjusted yield characteristics. Each\nfixed-income sector has its own risk profile.\nIneligible ETFs include those that had more\nthan 10 non-trading days in the prior quarter,\ntax exempt bonds, any ETFs on BlackRock's Rule\n12d1-4 List, available at www.iShares.com and\nany other exclusions, as defined in the Index\nRulebook. Once Morningstar has identified the\ninvestable universe, a proprietary model with\nan explicit preference for risk-adjusted\nyield, as developed by Morningstar, is applied\nto identify index constituents, which are then\nfurther subject to liquidity and minimum asset\nscreens. A fixed asset allocation and capping\nis then applied.\n\n40\n\nIssue Changes. Securities are added or deleted\nfrom each index, on a quarterly basis, based\non rules outlined for security selection,\nexclusion, rebalancing, and adjustments for\ncorporate actions as set forth in the Index\nRulebook. Scheduled Reconstitution Dates . The\nIndex is reconstituted quarterly. Adjustments\nare made on the last business day of the month\nin February, May, August, and November. The\nmarket data used for reconstitution and\nrebalance is as of previous month end.\nScheduled Rebalancing Dates. The index is\nrebalanced quarterly. Adjustments are made at\nthe close of trade on the last business day in\nFebruary, May, August, and November. The\nchanges become effective on the next business\nday. Market data used for rebalancing is as of\nprevious month end. Index Availability.\nMorningstar Indexes are calculated\ncontinuously and are available from major data\nvendors. Investment Policies The Board has\nadopted as fundamental policies the following\nnumbered investment policies, which cannot be\nchanged without the approval of the holders of\na majority of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. A vote of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund is\ndefined in the Investment Company Act as the\nlesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities present at a shareholder meeting,\nif the holders of more than 50% of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (ii) more\nthan 50% of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund. The Fund has also adopted certain\nnon-fundamental investment policies, including\nits investment objective. Non-fundamental\ninvestment policies may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval. Therefore,\nthe Fund may change its investment objective\nand its Underlying Index without shareholder\napproval. Fundamental Investment Policies The\nFund may not: 1. Concentrate its investments\nin a particular industry, as that term is used\nin the Investment Company Act, except that the\nFund will concentrate to approximately the\nsame extent that its Underlying Index\nconcentrates in the securities of a particular\nindustry or group of industries. 2. Borrow\nmoney, except as permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act. 3. Issue senior\nsecurities to the extent such issuance would\nviolate the Investment Company Act. 4.\nPurchase or hold real estate, except the Fund\nmay purchase and hold securities or other\ninstruments that are secured by, or linked to,\nreal estate or interests therein, securities\nof REITs, mortgage-related securities and\nsecurities of issuers engaged in the real\nestate business, and the Fund may purchase and\nhold real estate as a result of the ownership\nof securities or other instruments. 5.\nUnderwrite securities issued by others, except\nto the extent that the sale of portfolio\nsecurities by the Fund may be deemed to be an\nunderwriting or as otherwise permitted by\napplicable law. 6. Purchase or sell\ncommodities or commodity contracts, except as\npermitted by the Investment Company Act. 7.\nMake loans to the extent prohibited by the\nInvestment Company Act. 8. Make any investment\ninconsistent with the Fund's classification as\na diversified company under the Investment\nCompany Act. Notations Regarding the Fund\u2019s\nFundamental Investment Policies The following\nnotations are not considered to be part of the\nFund\u2019s fundamental investment policies and are\nsubject to change without shareholder\napproval. With respect to the fundamental\npolicy relating to concentration set forth in\n(1) above, the Investment Company Act does not\ndefine what constitutes \u201c concentration \u201d in\nan industry. The SEC staff has taken the\nposition that investment of 25% or more of a\nfund\u2019s total assets in one or more issuers\nconducting their principal activities in the\nsame industry or group of industries\nconstitutes concentration. It is possible that\ninterpretations of concentration could change\nin the future. The policy in (1) above will be\ninterpreted to refer to concentration as that\nterm may be interpreted from time to time. The\npolicy also will be interpreted to permit\ninvestment without limit in the following:\nsecurities of the U.S. government and its\nagencies or\n\n41\n\ninstrumentalities; securities of state,\nterritory, possession or municipal governments\nand their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\nthe Fund\u2019s industry classifications, the Fund\ncurrently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to the\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits the Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund\u2019s total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund\u2019s total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires the Fund to maintain at all times\nan \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300% of the\namount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means\nthe ratio that the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets (including amounts borrowed), minus\nliabilities other than borrowings, bears to\nthe aggregate amount of all borrowings.\nBorrowing money to increase portfolio holdings\nis known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d Certain trading\npractices and investments, such as reverse\nrepurchase agreements, may be considered to be\nborrowings or involve leverage and thus are\nsubject to the Investment Company Act\nrestrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4\nunder the Investment Company Act, when the\nFund engages in reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions, the Fund\nmay either (i) maintain asset coverage of at\nleast 300% with respect to such transactions\nand any other borrowings in the aggregate, or\n(ii) treat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit the\nFund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits the Fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of the Fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s investments in issuers\nwhere the Fund owns more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of those\nissuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund\nengaging in transactions involving the\nacquisition or disposition of portfolio\nsecurities may be considered to be an\nunderwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is\nnot believed that the application of the 1933\nAct provisions described above would cause the\nFund to be engaged in the business of\nunderwriting, the policy in (5) above will be\ninterpreted not to prevent the Fund from\nengaging in transactions involving the\nacquisition or disposition of portfolio\nsecurities, regardless of whether the Fund may\nbe considered to be an underwriter under the\n1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the\nunderwriting business to the extent permitted\nby applicable law. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit the Fund from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nThe Fund is currently classified as a\ndiversified fund under the Investment Company\nAct. This means that the Fund may not purchase\nsecurities of an issuer (other than (i)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\nand (ii) securities of other investment\ncompanies) if, with respect to 75% of its\ntotal assets, (a) more than 5% of the Fund's\ntotal assets would be invested in securities\nof that issuer or (b) the Fund would hold more\nthan 10% of the outstanding voting securities\nof that issuer. With respect to the remaining\n25% of its total assets, the Fund can invest\nmore than 5% of its assets in one issuer.\nUnder the Investment Company Act, the Fund\ncannot change its classification from\ndiversified to non-diversified without\nshareholder approval. Non-Fundamental\nInvestment Policies\n\n42\n\nThe Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy\nnot to make short sales of securities or\nmaintain a short position, except to the\nextent permitted by the Fund\u2019s Prospectus and\nSAI, as amended from time to time, and\napplicable law. The Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental investment policy in accordance\nwith Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest,\nunder normal circumstances, at least 80% of\nthe value of its net assets, plus the amount\nof any borrowings for investment purposes, in\ncomponent securities in the Fund's Underlying\nIndex. The Fund also has adopted a policy to\nprovide its shareholders with at least 60\ndays' prior written notice of any change in\nsuch policy. If, subsequent to an investment,\nthe 80% requirement is no longer met, the\nFund's future investments will be made in a\nmanner that will bring the Fund into\ncompliance with this policy. The Fund has\nadopted a non-fundamental policy not to invest\nin the securities of a company for the purpose\nof exercising management or control, or\npurchase or otherwise acquire any illiquid\ninvestment, except as permitted under the 1940\nAct, which currently limits the Fund\u2019s\nholdings in illiquid investments to 15% of the\nFund\u2019s net assets. BFA monitors Fund holdings\nin illiquid investments pursuant to the\nLiquidity Program. Except with regard to the\nfundamental policy relating to senior\nsecurities set forth in (3) above, if any\npercentage restriction described above is\ncomplied with at the time of an investment, a\nlater increase or decrease in percentage\nresulting from a change in values of assets\nwill not constitute a violation of such\nrestriction. Unless otherwise indicated, all\nlimitations under the Fund\u2019s fundamental or\nnon-fundamental investment policies apply only\nat the time that a transaction is undertaken.\nAny change in the percentage of the Fund\u2019s\nassets invested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from market fluctuations\nor other changes in the Fund\u2019s total assets\nwill not require the Fund to dispose of an\ninvestment until BFA determines that it is\npracticable to sell or close out the\ninvestment without undue market or tax\nconsequences. Continuous Offering The method\nby which Creation Units are created and traded\nmay raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Fund on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery requirement and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client\nmay be deemed a statutory underwriter if it\ntakes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into\nconstituent shares and sells such shares\ndirectly to customers or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of new shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the 1933 Act must take into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-\ndealer or its client in the particular case\nand the examples mentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions\nin shares, whether or not participating in the\ndistribution of shares, generally are required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in\nrespect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus delivery obligation with\nrespect to shares of the Fund are reminded\nthat, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act,\na prospectus delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange\nmember in connection with a sale on the\nListing Exchange generally is satisfied by the\nfact that the prospectus is available at the\nListing Exchange upon request. The prospectus\ndelivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\nan exchange.\n\n43\n\nManagement Trustees and Officers. The Board\nhas responsibility for the overall management\nand operations of the Fund, including general\nsupervision of the duties performed by BFA and\nother service providers.

The registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nBlackRock-advised Funds \u201d ) are organized into\none complex of open-end equity, multi-asset,\nindex and money market funds and ETFs (the \u201c\nBlackRock Multi-Asset Complex \u201d ), one complex\nof closed-end funds and open-end non-index\nfixed-income funds (including ETFs) (the \u201c\nBlackRock Fixed-Income Complex \u201d ) and one\ncomplex of ETFs ( \u201c Exchange-Traded Fund\nComplex \u201d ) (each, a \u201c BlackRock Fund Complex\n\u201d ). The Fund is included in the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves\nas a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee\nof iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result,\noversees all of the funds within the Exchange-\nTraded Fund Complex, which consists of 403\nfunds as of March 1, 2024.

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Fund rests\nwith the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to\nmanage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The\nBoard is responsible for overseeing BFA and\nother service providers in the operations of\nthe Fund in accordance with the provisions of\nthe 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state\nand other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The\nBoard is currently composed of eleven members,\nnine of whom are Independent Trustees. The\nBoard currently conducts regular in person\nmeetings four times a year. In addition, the\nBoard frequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The Independent Trustees meet\nregularly outside the presence of management,\nin executive session or with other service\nproviders to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Fund, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Fund with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the oversight functions delegated to\nthe Committee by the Board and reports its\nfinding to the Board. The Board and each\nstanding Committee conduct annual assessments\nof their oversight function and structure. The\nBoard has determined that the Board\u2019s\nleadership structure is appropriate because it\nallows the Board to exercise independent\njudgment over management and it allocates\nareas of responsibility among committees of\nIndependent Trustees and the full Board to\nenhance effective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Fund is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. The\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Fund. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of the\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Fund. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by the Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting the Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Fund's\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support the Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight\n\n51\n\nresponsibilities. From time to time, the Board\nmay modify the manner in which it conducts\nrisk oversight. The Board\u2019s oversight role\ndoes not make it a guarantor of the Fund's\ninvestment performance or other activities.\nCommittees of the Board of Trustees.

Certain activities of\nBFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively\nreferred to in this section as \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, with respect to the Fund and/or\nother accounts managed by BlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, including the business units or\nentities and personnel who may be involved in\nthe investment activities and business\noperations of the Fund, are engaged worldwide\nin businesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Fund. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by the Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of the\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or client accounts, will be executed\nindependently of the Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFund. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell\nthe same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding the Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor the Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of the\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding\nthe Fund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for the Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to\n\n57\n\nimplement internal policies and procedures\ndesigned to limit such consequences, which may\ncause the Fund to be unable to engage in\ncertain activities, including purchasing or\ndisposing of securities, when it might\notherwise be desirable for it to do so.\nConflicts may also arise because portfolio\ndecisions regarding the Fund may benefit other\naccounts managed by BlackRock. For example,\nthe sale of a long position or establishment\nof a short position by the Fund may impair the\nprice of the same security sold short by (and\ntherefore benefit) BlackRock or its other\naccounts or funds, and the purchase of a\nsecurity or covering of a short position in a\nsecurity by the Fund may increase the price of\nthe same security held by (and therefore\nbenefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or\nfunds. In addition, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, the Fund may invest its assets\nin other funds advised by BlackRock, including\nfunds that are managed by one or more of the\nsame portfolio managers, which could result in\nconflicts of interest relating to asset\nallocation, timing of Fund purchases and\nsales, and increased remuneration and\nprofitability for BlackRock, and/or its\npersonnel, including portfolio managers. In\ncertain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of\nthe Fund, may seek to buy from or sell\nsecurities to another fund or account advised\nby BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not\nrequired to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Fund, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Fund. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when the\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which the Fund\nhas invested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of\nthe Fund's investments may be negatively\nimpacted by the activities of BlackRock or its\nclients, and transactions for the Fund may be\nimpaired or effected at prices or terms that\nmay be less favorable than would otherwise\nhave been the case. The results of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities may differ significantly\nfrom the results achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by the\nFund. Moreover, it is possible that the Fund\nwill sustain losses during periods in which\none or more proprietary or other accounts\nmanaged or advised by BlackRock achieve\nsignificant profits. The opposite result is\nalso possible. From time to time, the Fund may\nbe restricted from purchasing or selling\nsecurities, or from engaging in other\ninvestment activities because of regulatory,\nlegal or contractual requirements applicable\nto BlackRock or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock, and/or the internal\npolicies of BlackRock designed to comply with\nsuch requirements. As a result, there may be\nperiods, for example, when BlackRock will not\ninitiate or recommend certain types of\ntransactions in certain securities or\ninstruments with respect to which BlackRock is\nperforming services or when position limits\nhave been reached. For example, the investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and accounts under its management may\nlimit the investment opportunities for the\nFund in certain emerging and other markets in\nwhich limitations are imposed upon the amount\nof investment, in the aggregate or in\nindividual issuers, by affiliated foreign\ninvestors. In connection with its management\nof the Fund, BlackRock may have access to\ncertain fundamental analysis and proprietary\ntechnical models developed by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will not be under any obligation,\nhowever, to effect transactions on behalf of\nthe Fund in accordance with such analysis and\nmodels. In addition, BlackRock will not have\nany obligation to make available any\ninformation regarding its proprietary\nactivities or strategies, or the activities or\nstrategies used for other accounts managed by\nthem, for the benefit of the management of the\nFund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock\nwill have access to such information for the\npurpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary\nactivities or portfolio strategies of\nBlackRock, or the activities or strategies\nused for accounts managed by BlackRock or\nother client accounts could conflict with the\ntransactions and strategies employed by\nBlackRock in managing the Fund. The Fund may\nbe included in investment models developed by\nBlackRock for use by clients and financial\nadvisors. To the extent clients invest in\nthese investment models and increase the\nassets under management of the Fund, the\ninvestment management fee amounts paid by the\nFund to BlackRock may also increase. The\nprice, availability and liquidity of the Fund\nmay be impacted by purchases and sales of the\nFund by model-driven investment portfolios, as\nwell as by BlackRock itself and by its\nadvisory clients.\n\n58\n\nIn addition, certain principals and certain\nemployees of the Fund\u2019s investment adviser are\nalso principals or employees of other business\nunits or entities within BlackRock. As a\nresult, these principals and employees may\nhave obligations to such other business units\nor entities or their clients and such\nobligations to other business units or\nentities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of the\nFund in which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by the Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which the Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non the Fund could potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthe Fund and increased assets under management\nfor BlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Fund or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may from\ntime to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. The Fund may,\nsubject to applicable law, purchase\ninvestments that are the subject of an\nunderwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse to those\nof the Fund. At times, these activities may\ncause business units or entities within\nBlackRock to give advice to clients that may\ncause these clients to take actions adverse to\nthe interests of the Fund. To the extent such\ntransactions are permitted, the Fund will deal\nwith BlackRock on an arm\u2019s-length basis. To\nthe extent authorized by applicable law,\nBlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent,\nlender or adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund. It is anticipated\nthat the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs,\nfinancial advisory fees, underwriting and\nplacement fees, sales fees, financing and\ncommitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees,\ncompensation or profits, rates, terms and\nconditions charged by BlackRock will be in its\nview commercially reasonable, although\nBlackRock, including its sales personnel, will\nhave an interest in obtaining fees and other\namounts that are favorable to BlackRock and\nsuch sales personnel, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. Index based funds\nmay use an index provider that is affiliated\nwith another service provider of the Fund or\nBlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer,\nagent, lender or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund or BlackRock. Subject\nto applicable law, BlackRock (and its\npersonnel and other distributors) will be\nentitled to retain fees and other amounts that\nthey receive in connection with their service\nto the Fund as broker, dealer, agent, lender,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities. No\naccounting to the Fund or its shareholders\nwill be required, and no fees or other\ncompensation payable by the Fund or its\nshareholders will be reduced by reason of\nreceipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other\namounts. When BlackRock acts as broker,\ndealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities in relation to the Fund, BlackRock\nmay take commercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund. The Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund's own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with the Fund's establishment of\nits business relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund's counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund's creditworthiness.\n\n59\n\nBTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC\nexemptive relief, acts as securities lending\nagent to, and receives a share of securities\nlending revenues from, the Fund. BlackRock\nwill also receive compensation for managing\nthe reinvestment of the cash collateral from\nsecurities lending. There are potential\nconflicts of interests in managing a\nsecurities lending program, including but not\nlimited to: (i) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to, among\nother things, increase or decrease the amount\nof securities on loan or to lend particular\nsecurities in order to generate additional\nrisk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its\naffiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities\nlending agent may have an incentive to\nallocate loans to clients that would provide\nmore revenue to BlackRock. As described\nfurther below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate\nthis conflict by providing its securities\nlending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Fund and certain other clients\nand/or funds against a shortfall in collateral\nin the event of borrower default. On a regular\nbasis, BlackRock calculates the potential\ndollar exposure of collateral shortfall\nresulting from a borrower default ( \u201c\nshortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e ., indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a loan opportunity arrives; and\n(iii) the lending portfolio must also have\nenough inventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. BlackRock may decline to\nmake a securities loan on behalf of the Fund,\ndiscontinue lending on behalf of the Fund or\nterminate a securities loan on behalf of the\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing or eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for the Fund may\nbe bunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Fund will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Fund. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Fund will not\nbe charged the same commission or commission\nequivalent rates in connection with a bunched\nor aggregated order. Subject to applicable\nlaw, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish\nBlackRock, the Fund, other BlackRock client\naccounts or personnel, directly or through\ncorrespondent relationships, with research or\nother appropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Fund and other\nBlackRock client\n\n60\n\naccounts, including in connection with\nBlackRock client accounts other than those\nthat pay commissions to the broker relating to\nthe research or other service arrangements.\nSuch products and services may\ndisproportionately benefit other BlackRock\nclient accounts relative to the Fund based on\nthe amount of brokerage commissions paid by\nthe Fund and such other BlackRock client\naccounts. For example, research or other\nservices that are paid for through one\nclient's commissions may not be used in\nmanaging that client's account. In addition,\nother BlackRock client accounts may receive\nthe benefit, including disproportionate\nbenefits, of economies of scale or price\ndiscounts in connection with products and\nservices that may be provided to the Fund and\nto such other BlackRock client accounts. To\nthe extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars,\nit will not have to pay for those products and\nservices itself. BlackRock does not currently\nenter into arrangements to use the Fund's\nassets for, or participate in, soft dollars,\nalthough BlackRock may receive research that\nis bundled with the trade execution, clearing,\nand/or settlement services provided by a\nparticular broker-dealer. To the extent that\nBlackRock receives research on this basis,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. For\nexample, the research effectively will be paid\nby client commissions that also will be used\nto pay for the execution, clearing, and\nsettlement services provided by the broker-\ndealer and will not be paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable\nlaw, may endeavor to execute trades through\nbrokers who, pursuant to such arrangements,\nprovide research or other services in order to\nensure the continued receipt of research or\nother services BlackRock believes are useful\nin its investment decision-making process.\nBlackRock may from time to time choose not to\nengage in the above described arrangements to\nvarying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited\nby applicable law, may also enter into\ncommission sharing arrangements under which\nBlackRock may execute transactions through a\nbroker-dealer, and request that the broker-\ndealer allocate a portion of the commissions\nor commission credits to another firm that\nprovides research to BlackRock. To the extent\nthat BlackRock engages in commission sharing\narrangements, many of the same conflicts\nrelated to traditional soft dollars may exist.\nBlackRock may utilize certain electronic\ncrossing networks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including,\nwithout limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock\nhas an investment or other interest, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law) in\nexecuting client securities transactions for\ncertain types of securities. These ECNs may\ncharge fees for their services, including\naccess fees and transaction fees. The\ntransaction fees, which are similar to\ncommissions or markups/markdowns, will\ngenerally be charged to clients and, like\ncommissions and markups/markdowns, would\ngenerally be included in the cost of the\nsecurities purchased. Access fees may be paid\nby BlackRock even though incurred in\nconnection with executing transactions on\nbehalf of clients, including the Fund. In\ncertain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume\ndiscounts that will reduce the access fees\ntypically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nonly utilize ECNs consistent with its\nobligation to seek to obtain best execution in\nclient transactions. BlackRock owns a minority\ninterest in, and is a member of, Members\nExchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly created U.S.\nstock exchange. Transactions for the Fund may\nbe executed on MEMX if third party brokers\nselect MEMX as the appropriate venue for\nexecution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of such Funds. In addition,\ntransactions in Fund shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the\nappropriate venue for the execution of such\norders. BlackRock has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent conflicts of\ninterest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Fund, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock's fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee the Proxy Voting Policy section of this\nSAI. It is also possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of\nthe Fund. Increasing the Fund\u2019s assets may\nenhance liquidity, investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the\nright, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw, to sell into the market or redeem in\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of the Fund acquired for its own\naccounts or the account of a BlackRock\nadvisory client. A large sale or redemption of\nshares of the Fund by BlackRock itself or a\nBlackRock advisory client could significantly\nreduce the asset size of the Fund, which might\nhave an adverse effect on the Fund's\nliquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio\ndiversification, expense ratio or ability to\ncomply with the listing requirements for the\nFund.\n\n61\n\nIt is possible that the Fund may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in transactions with,\ncompanies in which BlackRock has significant\ndebt or equity investments or other interests.\nThe Fund may also invest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for which\nBlackRock provides and is compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to the proceeds\nfrom the sale of such issuances. In making\ninvestment decisions for the Fund, BlackRock\nis not permitted to obtain or use material\nnon-public information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from time to time, the activities\nof BlackRock may limit the Fund's flexibility\nin purchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment. BlackRock, its\npersonnel and other financial service\nproviders may have interests in promoting\nsales of the Fund. With respect to BlackRock\nand its personnel, the remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Fund or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFund or its shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFund may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or the Fund, may\nsponsor events (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to the Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients'\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\nthe Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other data sources unavailable to the\nFund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will\ngenerally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to the Fund's\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund's pricing\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan the valuation for such security or\ninvestment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock. As disclosed in more detail in the\nDetermination of Net Asset Value section in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value by BFA. BFA has been designated\nas the Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBFA pricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that the Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BFA using proprietary or third-party\nvaluation models, fair value represents only a\ngood faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of one or\nmore assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, the Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, the Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in the Fund\nbearing some additional expenses. BlackRock\nand its directors, officers and employees, may\nbuy and sell securities or other investments\nfor their own accounts and may have conflicts\nof interest with respect to investments made\non behalf of the Fund. As a result of\ndiffering trading\n\n62\n\nand investment strategies or constraints,\npositions may be taken by directors, officers\nand employees that are the same, different\nfrom or made at different times than positions\ntaken for the Fund. To lessen the possibility\nthat the Fund will be adversely affected by\nthis personal trading, the Fund, BFA and\nBlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics\nin compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940\nAct that restricts securities trading in the\npersonal accounts of investment professionals\nand others who normally come into possession\nof information regarding the Fund's portfolio\ntransactions. Each code of ethics is available\nby contacting BlackRock at the telephone\nnumber on the back cover of the Fund\u2019s\nProspectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database\non the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\nthe Fund, except that the Fund may in\naccordance with rules or guidance adopted\nunder the 1940 Act engage in transactions with\nanother Fund or accounts that are affiliated\nwith the Fund as a result of common officers,\ndirectors, or investment advisers or pursuant\nto exemptive orders granted to the Fund and/or\nBlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would\nbe effected in circumstances in which\nBlackRock determined that it would be\nappropriate for the Fund to purchase and\nanother client of BlackRock to sell, or the\nFund to sell and another client of BlackRock\nto purchase, the same security or instrument\non the same day. From time to time, the\nactivities of the Fund may be restricted\nbecause of regulatory requirements applicable\nto BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal\npolicies designed to comply with, limit the\napplicability of, or otherwise relate to such\nrequirements. A client not advised by\nBlackRock would not be subject to some of\nthose considerations. There may be periods\nwhen BlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of the Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which the Fund wishes to\npurchase or sell. However, if permitted by\napplicable law, and where consistent with\nBlackRock\u2019s policies and procedures (including\nthe necessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Fund may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Fund. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Fund invests in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or is\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invests in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Fund) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Fund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or the Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Fund), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the Fund),\nmay limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Fund),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations.\n\n63\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, other ownership\nthresholds may trigger reporting requirements\nto governmental and regulatory authorities,\nand such reports may entail the disclosure of\nthe identity of a client or BlackRock\u2019s\nintended strategy with respect to such\nsecurity or asset. BlackRock may not serve as\nan Authorized Participant in the creation and\nredemption of iShares ETFs. Under an ETF\nServices Agreement, the Fund has retained\nBRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain\norder processing, Authorized Participant\ncommunications, and related services in\nconnection with the issuance and redemption of\nCreation Units of the Fund ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d\n). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard\ntransaction fee received from Authorized\nParticipants on each creation or redemption\norder from the Authorized Participant for the\nETF Services provided. BlackRock collaborated\nwith, and received payment from, Citibank,\nN.A. ( \u201c Citibank \u201d ) on the design and\ndevelopment of the ETF Services platform.\nCitibank may have, or from time to time may\ndevelop, additional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its\naffiliates. In order to defray transaction\nexpenses and protect against possible\nshareholder dilution, the Fund may collect\ncertain fees from Authorized Participants in\nconnection with cash substitutions for\ncreation and redemption transactions. While\nBlackRock uses good faith estimates of the\nexpected costs to the Fund in determining the\nrates for fees collected by the Fund related\nto creation and redemption activity, BlackRock\nmay have incentives to improve Fund\nperformance through the collection of these\nfees. As these charges are based on estimates,\nwhere the charges exceed actual transaction\ncosts incurred by the Fund, Fund performance\ncould improve as a result. BlackRock has\nestablished processes to oversee the\ndetermination of these estimates in an effort\nto mitigate this conflict. BlackRock may\nmaintain securities indices. To the extent\npermitted by applicable laws, the Fund may\nseek to license and use such indices as part\nof its investment strategy. Index based funds\nthat seek to track the performance of\nsecurities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Fund using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to the\nFund and the Fund is under no obligation to\nuse BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters\ninto a license for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to the Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to the\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Fund,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to the Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to the Fund, or the\nselection of such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by the Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Fund, that engage the\nservice provider (typically the custodian).\nThe Fund\u2019s service provider remunerates\nBlackRock for the use of the systems. The Fund\nservice provider\u2019s payments to BlackRock for\nthe use of these systems may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock.\n\n64\n\nBlackRock\u2019s receipt of fees from a service\nprovider in connection with the use of systems\nprovided by BlackRock may create an incentive\nfor BlackRock to recommend that the Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider. In recognition of a BlackRock\nclient\u2019s overall relationship with BlackRock,\nBlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in the Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock (including BFA), its\ndirectors, officers and employees, in addition\nto those described in this section, may give\nrise to additional conflicts of interest.\nInvestment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services Investment Adviser. BFA\nserves as investment adviser to the Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, and\nBFA. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is\nregistered as an investment adviser under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nUnder the investment advisory agreement, BFA,\nsubject to the supervision of the Board and in\nconformity with the stated investment policies\nof the Fund, manages and administers the Trust\nand the investment of the Fund\u2019s assets. BFA\nis responsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the investment advisory agreement, BFA may,\nfrom time to time, in its sole discretion and\nto the extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to the Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. BFA is\nresponsible, under the investment advisory\nagreement, for substantially all expenses of\nthe Fund, including the cost of transfer\nagency, custody, fund administration, legal,\naudit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Fund will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees). BFA may from time to time\nvoluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, if any).

For the fiscal year ended October 31,\n2023, the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of\nthe Fund amounted to an annual rate of 0.19%.\nBFA has contractually agreed to waive its\nmanagement fee through February 28, 2026. The\ncontractual waiver may be terminated prior to\nFebruary 28, 2026 only upon written agreement\nof the Trust and BFA. For the fiscal years\nended October 31, 2023, October 31, 2022 and\nOctober 31, 2021, BFA waived $259,574,\n$281,029 and $495,304 of its management fees,\nrespectively. The investment advisory\nagreement with respect to the Fund continues\nin effect for two years from its effective\ndate, and thereafter is subject to annual\napproval by (i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of\na majority of the outstanding voting\nsecurities (as\n\n65\n\ndefined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund, provided\nthat in either event such continuance also is\napproved by a majority of the Board members\nwho are not interested persons (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the Fund, by a vote cast in\nperson at a meeting called for the purpose of\nvoting on such approval. The investment\nadvisory agreement with respect to the Fund is\nterminable without penalty, on 60 days\u2019\nnotice, by the Board or by a vote of the\nholders of a majority of the Fund\u2019s\noutstanding voting securities (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act).

As a consequence, from time to\ntime the Fund may receive a smaller allocation\nof an investment opportunity than it would\nhave if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its\naffiliates did not manage other portfolios or\naccounts. Like the Fund, the other portfolios\nor accounts for which the Portfolio Managers\nare primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management generally pay an asset-\nbased fee to BFA or its affiliates, as\napplicable, for its advisory services. One or\nmore of those other portfolios or accounts,\nhowever, may pay BFA or its affiliates a\nperformance-based fee in lieu of, or in\naddition to, an asset-based fee for its\nadvisory services. A portfolio or account with\na performance-based fee would pay BFA or its\naffiliates a portion of that portfolio\u2019s or\naccount\u2019s gains, or would pay BFA or its\naffiliates more for its services than would\notherwise be the case if BFA or any of its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Fund should be aware that,\nas with any group of portfolios and accounts\nmanaged by an investment adviser and/or its\naffiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements.\n\n66\n\nThe tables below show, for each Portfolio\nManager, the number of portfolios or accounts\nof the types set forth in the above tables and\nthe aggregate of total assets in those\nportfolios or accounts with respect to which\nthe investment management fees are based on\nthe performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of October 31, 2023:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        FeesManaged  Total Assets   \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        FeesManaged  Total Assets   \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                OtherAccounts                 \n  Types of      withPerforma\u2026    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts        FeesManaged   Total Assets  \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1  $2,352,000,0\u2026  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of October 31, 2023.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance. As of October 31, 2023,\nthe Portfolio Managers did not beneficially\nown shares of the Fund.\n\n67\n\nCodes of Ethics. The Trust, BFA and the\nDistributor have adopted codes of ethics\npursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. The\ncodes of ethics permit personnel subject to\nthe codes of ethics to invest in securities,\nsubject to certain limitations, including\nsecurities that may be purchased or held by\nthe Fund. Each code of ethics is available by\ncontacting BlackRock at the telephone number\non the back cover of the Fund\u2019s Prospectus or\nby accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's\nInternet site at http://www.sec.gov, and\ncopies may be obtained, after paying a\nduplicating fee, by e-mail at\npublicinfo@sec.gov. Anti-Money Laundering\nRequirements. The Fund is subject to the USA\nPATRIOT Act (the \u201c Patriot Act \u201d ). The\nPatriot Act is intended to prevent the use of\nthe U.S. financial system in furtherance of\nmoney laundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Pursuant to requirements under the\nPatriot Act, the Fund may request information\nfrom Authorized Participants to enable it to\nform a reasonable belief that it knows the\ntrue identity of its Authorized Participants.\nThis information will be used to verify the\nidentity of Authorized Participants or, in\nsome cases, the status of financial\nprofessionals; it will be used only for\ncompliance with the requirements of the\nPatriot Act. The Fund reserves the right to\nreject purchase orders from persons who have\nnot submitted information sufficient to allow\nthe Fund to verify their identity. The Fund\nalso reserves the right to redeem any amounts\nin the Fund from persons whose identity it is\nunable to verify on a timely basis. It is the\nFund's policy to cooperate fully with\nappropriate regulators in any investigations\nconducted with respect to potential money\nlaundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Administrator, Custodian and\nTransfer Agent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( \u201c\nJPMorgan \u201d ) serves as administrator,\ncustodian and transfer agent for the Fund\nunder the Master Services Agreement (the \u201c\nMaster Services Agreement \u201d ). JPMorgan\u2019s\nprincipal address is 383 Madison Avenue, 11 th\nFloor, New York, NY 10179. Pursuant to the\nMaster Services Agreement with the Trust,\nJPMorgan provides necessary administrative,\ntax and accounting and financial reporting\nservices for the maintenance and operations of\nthe Trust and the Fund. In addition, JPMorgan\nmakes available the office space, equipment,\npersonnel and facilities required to provide\nsuch services. Pursuant to the Master Services\nAgreement with the Trust, JPMorgan maintains,\nin separate accounts, cash, securities and\nother assets of the Trust and the Fund, keeps\nall necessary accounts and records and\nprovides other services. JPMorgan is required,\nupon the order of the Trust, to deliver\nsecurities held by JPMorgan and to make\npayments for securities purchased by the Trust\nfor the Fund. JPMorgan is authorized to\nappoint certain foreign custodians or foreign\ncustody managers for Fund investments outside\nthe U.S. Pursuant to the Master Services\nAgreement with the Trust, JPMorgan acts as a\ntransfer agent for the Fund\u2019s authorized and\nissued shares of beneficial interest, and as\ndividend disbursing agent of the Trust. As\ncompensation for these services, JPMorgan\nreceives certain out-of-pocket costs,\ntransaction fees and asset-based fees which\nare accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA. BFA\npays the compensation because it has agreed to\npay these operating expenses under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement as described\ntherein. Distributor. The Distributor's\nprincipal address is 50 Hudson Yards, New\nYork, NY 10001. Shares are continuously\noffered for sale by the Fund through the\nDistributor or its agent only in Creation\nUnits, as described in the Prospectus and\nbelow in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI. Fund\nshares in amounts less than Creation Units are\ngenerally not distributed by the Distributor\nor its agent. The Distributor or its agent\nwill arrange for the delivery of the\nProspectus and, upon request, this SAI to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nor its agents and confirmations of acceptance\nfurnished by it or its agents. The Distributor\nis a broker-dealer registered under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.\n( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor is also\nlicensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S.\nstates, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands and the District of Columbia.\nThe Distribution Agreement for the Fund\nprovides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii)\nthe vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the Fund. The Distribution Agreement will\nterminate automatically in the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act). The\nDistributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers\n\u201d ) who will solicit purchases of Creation\nUnits of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers\nmay also be Authorized Participants (as\ndescribed below), Depository Trust Company ( \u201c\nDTC \u201d ) participants and/or investor services\norganizations. BFA or its affiliates may, from\ntime to time and from its own resources, pay,\ndefray or absorb costs relating to\ndistribution, including payments out of its\nown resources to the Distributor, or to\notherwise promote the sale of shares.\n\n68\n\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that the\nFund engages in securities lending, the Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund, subject\nto the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to\na written agreement (the \u201c Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement \u201d ). The Fund and each\nUnderlying Fund retain a portion of the\nsecurities lending income and remit the\nremaining portion to BTC as compensation for\nits services as securities lending agent.\nSecurities lending income is generally equal\nto the total of income earned from the\nreinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes\ncollateral investment fees as defined below),\nand any fees or other payments to and from\nborrowers of securities. As securities lending\nagent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending. The\nFund and each Underlying Fund are responsible\nfor fees in connection with the investment of\ncash collateral received for securities on\nloan in a money market fund managed by BFA\n(the \u201c collateral investment fees \u201d );\nhowever, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount\nof securities lending income it receives in\norder to effectively limit the collateral\ninvestment fees the Fund bears to an annual\nrate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares\nwill not be subject to a sales load,\nredemption fee, distribution fee or service\nfee. Under the securities lending program, the\nFund is categorized into one of several\nspecific asset classes. The determination of\nthe Fund\u2019s asset class category (fixed-income,\ndomestic equity, international equity or fund-\nof-funds), each of which may be subject to a\ndifferent fee arrangement, is based on a\nmethodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.\nPursuant to the current Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement: (i) fund-of-funds, such as\nthe Fund, retain 82% of securities lending\nincome (which excludes collateral investment\nfees), and (ii) this amount can never be less\nthan 70% of the sum of securities lending\nincome plus collateral investment fees. In\naddition, commencing the business day\nfollowing the date that the aggregate\nsecurities lending income (which includes, for\nthis purpose, collateral investment fees)\nearned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex\n(as defined in the Management \u2014 Trustees and\nOfficers section of this SAI) in a calendar\nyear exceeds a specified threshold, each\napplicable fund-of-fund, pursuant to the\ncurrent Securities Lending Agency Agreement,\nwill receive for the remainder of that\ncalendar year securities lending income as\nfollows: (i) 85% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees)\nand (ii) this amount can never be less than\n70% of the sum of securities lending income\nplus collateral investment fees. The services\nprovided to the Fund by BTC in the most recent\nfiscal year ended October 31, 2023 primarily\nincluded the following: (1) selecting\nborrowers from an approved list of borrowers\nand executing a securities lending agreement\nas agent on behalf of the Fund with each such\nborrower; (2) negotiating the terms of\nsecurities loans, including the amount of\nfees; (3) directing the delivery of loaned\nsecurities; (4) monitoring the daily value of\nthe loaned securities and directing the\npayment of additional collateral or the return\nof excess collateral, as necessary; (5)\ninvesting cash collateral received in\nconnection with any loaned securities; (6)\nmonitoring distributions on loaned securities\n(for example, interest and dividend activity);\n(7) in the event of default by a borrower with\nrespect to any securities loan, using the\ncollateral or the proceeds of the liquidation\nof collateral to purchase replacement\nsecurities of the same issue, type, class and\nseries as that of the loaned securities; and\n(8) terminating securities loans and arranging\nfor the return of loaned securities to the\nFund at loan termination. The following table\nshows the dollar amounts of income and\nfees/compensation related to the securities\nlending activities of the Fund during its most\nrecent fiscal year ended October 31, 2023.\n\n69\n                                              \n                                     iShares  \n  Fund                   YieldOptimized Bond  \n                                         ETF  \n  Gross income                                \n  fromsecuritieslendi\u2026            $1,203,512  \n  activities                                  \n  Fees and/or                                 \n  compensationfor                             \n  securities                                  \n  lendingactivities                           \n  andrelated services                         \n  Securities                                  \n  lendingincome paid                          \n  toBTC for services                  47,363  \n  assecuritieslending                         \n  agent                                       \n  Cash                                        \n  collateralmanagemen\u2026                        \n  not included                         9,288  \n  insecurities                                \n  lendingincome paid                          \n  to BTC                                      \n  Administrative fees                         \n  notincluded in                           0  \n  securitieslending                           \n  income paidto BTC                           \n  Indemnification fees                        \n  notincludedin                               \n  securities                               0  \n  lendingincome paidto                        \n  BTC                                         \n  Rebates (paid                      918,499  \n  toborrowers)                                \n  Other fees                                  \n  notincluded                                 \n  insecurities                             0  \n  lendingincome                               \n  paid to BTC                                 \n  Aggregatefees/compe\u2026                        \n  forsecurities                     $975,150  \n  lendingactivities                           \n  Net income from                             \n  securitieslending                 $228,362  \n  activities                                  \n                                              \nPayments by BFA and its Affiliates. BFA and/or\nits affiliates ( \u201c BFA Entities \u201d ) may pay\ncertain broker-dealers, registered investment\nadvisers, banks and other financial\nintermediaries ( \u201c Intermediaries \u201d ) for\ncertain activities related to the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products in\ngeneral. BFA Entities make these payments from\ntheir own assets and\n\n70\n\nnot from the assets of the Fund. Although a\nportion of BFA Entities\u2019 revenue comes\ndirectly or indirectly in part from fees paid\nby the Fund, other iShares funds (including,\nif applicable, any underlying iShares funds\nheld by a Fund) or exchange-traded products,\nthese payments do not increase the price paid\nby investors for the purchase of shares of, or\nthe cost of owning, the Fund, other iShares\nfunds or exchange-traded products. BFA\nEntities make payments for Intermediaries\u2019\nparticipation in activities that are designed\nto make registered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Fund and other iShares funds, or\nfor other activities, such as participation in\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products ( \u201c\nPublishing Costs \u201d ). In addition, BFA\nEntities make payments to Intermediaries that\nmake shares of the Fund, other iShares funds\nor exchange-traded products available to their\nclients, in some cases at a waived or reduced\ncommission rate or ticket charge, develop new\nproducts that feature iShares, create\neducational content about the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products that\nis featured on an Intermediary\u2019s platform, or\notherwise promote the Fund, other iShares\nfunds and exchange-traded products. BFA\nEntities may also reimburse expenses or make\npayments from their own assets to\nIntermediaries or other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\niShares business or facilitate investment in\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. Payments of the type\ndescribed above are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its clients. These financial\nincentives may cause the Intermediary to\nrecommend the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products, or otherwise promote\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products over other investments. The\nsame conflicts of interest and financial\nincentives exist with respect to your\nsalesperson or other investment professional\nif he or she receives similar payments from\nhis or her Intermediary firm. In addition to\nthe payments described above, BFA Entities\nhave developed proprietary tools, calculators\nand related interactive or digital content\nthat is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Fund, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream\nFund Centre AG,\n\n71\n\nCommonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey\nWright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities\nLLC, Envestnet Asset Management, Inc., eToro\nUSA Securities Inc., LPL Financial LLC,\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith\nIncorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC,\nNorthwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC,\nOrion Portfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC,\nPublic Holdings, Inc., Raymond James Financial\nServices, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary\nWealth Group, LLC, Stash Investments LLC, TD\nAmeritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc.,\nWells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells\nFargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFund, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Fund, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Fund may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Fund would pay a fee\nto the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\nsecurities of the Fund to enhance the\nliquidity and quality of the secondary market\nof securities of the Fund. The fee would then\nbe credited by the exchange to one or more\nmarket makers that meet or exceed liquidity\nand market quality standards with respect to\nthe securities of the Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of the\nFund solely for the benefit of the Fund and\nwill not be paid from any Fund assets. Other\nfunds managed by BFA may also participate in\nsuch programs. Determination of Net Asset\nValue Valuation of Shares. The NAV for the\nFund is generally calculated as of the close\nof regular trading hours on the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is\nopen. Valuation of assets held by the Fund is\nas follows: Equity Investments. Equity\nsecurities traded on a recognized securities\nexchange ( e.g. , NYSE), on separate trading\nboards of a securities exchange or through a\nmarket system that provides contemporaneous\ntransaction pricing information (each an \u201c\nExchange \u201d ) are valued using information\nobtained via independent pricing services,\ngenerally at the closing price or, if an\nExchange closing price is not available, the\nlast traded price on that Exchange prior to\nthe time as of which the assets or liabilities\nare valued. However, under certain\ncircumstances, other means of determining\ncurrent market value may be used. If an equity\nsecurity is traded on more than one Exchange,\nthe current market value of the security where\nit is primarily traded generally will be used.\nIn the event that there are no sales involving\nan equity security held by the Fund on a day\non which the Fund values such security, the\nprior day\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the\nsecurity, in which case such asset would be\ntreated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined\nbelow). Fixed-Income Investments. Fixed-income\nsecurities for which market quotations are\nreadily available are generally valued using\nsuch securities\u2019 current market value. The\nFund values fixed-income portfolio securities\nusing the last available bid prices or current\nmarket quotations provided by dealers or\nprices (including evaluated prices) supplied\nby the Fund\u2019s approved independent third-party\npricing services, each in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. The pricing services may\nuse matrix pricing or valuation models that\nutilize certain inputs and assumptions to\nderive values, including transaction data (\ne.g ., recent representative bids and offers),\ncredit quality information, perceived market\nmovements, news, and other relevant\ninformation and by other methods, which may\ninclude consideration of: yields or prices of\nsecurities of comparable quality, coupon,\nmaturity and type; indications as to values\nfrom dealers; general market conditions;\nand/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing\nservices generally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly transactions of an\ninstitutional round lot size, but the Fund may\nhold or transact in such securities in\nsmaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at\nlower prices than institutional round lots.\nThe amortized cost method of valuation may be\nused with respect to debt obligations with 60\ndays\n\n72\n\nor less remaining to maturity unless such\nmethod does not represent fair value. Certain\nfixed-income investments, including asset-\nbacked and mortgage-related securities, may be\nvalued based on valuation models that consider\nthe estimated cash flows of each tranche of\nthe issuer, establish a benchmark yield and\ndevelop an estimated tranche-specific spread\nto the benchmark yield based on the unique\nattributes of the tranche. Options, Futures,\nSwaps and Other Derivatives. Exchange-traded\nequity options (except those that are\ncustomized) for which market quotations are\nreadily available are valued at the mean of\nthe last bid and ask prices as quoted on the\nExchange or the board of trade on which such\noptions are traded. In the event that there is\nno mean price available for an exchange traded\nequity option held by the Fund on a day on\nwhich the Fund values such option, the last\nbid (long positions) or ask (short positions)\nprice, if available, will be used as the value\nof such option. If no bid or ask price is\navailable on a day on which the Fund values\nsuch option, the prior day\u2019s price will be\nused, unless BFA determines that such prior\nday\u2019s price no longer reflects the fair value\nof the option, in which case such option will\nbe treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined\nbelow). Customized exchange-traded equity\noptions, as well as OTC derivatives, may be\nvalued using a mathematical model which may\nincorporate a number of market data factors.\nFinancial futures contracts and options\nthereon, which are traded on exchanges, are\nvalued at their last sale price or settle\nprice as of the close of such exchanges. Swap\nagreements and other derivatives are generally\nvalued daily based upon quotations from market\nmakers or by a pricing service in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Underlying\nFunds. Shares of underlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds) are valued at\nNAV. Shares of underlying exchange-traded\nclosed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued\nat their most recent closing price. General\nValuation Information. Prices obtained from\nindependent third-party pricing services,\nbroker-dealers or market makers to value the\nFund\u2019s securities and other assets and\nliabilities are based on information available\nat the time the Fund values its assets and\nliabilities. In the event that a pricing\nservice quotation is revised or updated\nsubsequent to the day on which the Fund valued\nsuch security, the revised pricing service\nquotation generally will be applied\nprospectively. Such determination will be made\nconsidering pertinent facts and circumstances\nsurrounding the revision. The price the Fund\ncould receive upon the sale of any particular\nportfolio investment may differ from the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the investment,\nparticularly for assets that trade in thin or\nvolatile markets or that are valued using a\nfair valuation methodology or a price provided\nby an independent pricing service. As a\nresult, the price received upon the sale of an\ninvestment may be less than the value ascribed\nby the Fund, and the Fund could realize a\ngreater than expected loss or lesser than\nexpected gain upon the sale of the investment.\nThe Fund\u2019s ability to value its investment may\nalso be impacted by technological issues\nand/or errors by pricing services or other\nthird-party service providers. All cash,\nreceivables and current payables are carried\non the Fund\u2019s books at their fair value. In\nthe event that application of the methods of\nvaluation discussed above result in a price\nfor a security which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, the Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and liabilities (including securities\nfor which market quotations are not readily\navailable) held by the Fund (including\nrestricted securities) are valued at fair\nvalue as determined in good faith by BFA\npursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any\nassets and liabilities which are denominated\nin a foreign currency are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market rates. Use of\nfair value prices and certain current market\nvaluations could result in a difference\nbetween the prices used to calculate the\nFund\u2019s NAV and the prices used in the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn, could result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the Underlying Index.\nFair Value. When market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has\n\n73\n\noccurred after the close of trading for an\nasset or liability but prior to or at the time\nof pricing the Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities,\nis likely to cause a material change to the\nlast exchange closing price or closing market\nprice of one or more assets held by, or\nliabilities of, the Fund. On any day the NYSE\nis open and a foreign market or the primary\nexchange on which a foreign asset or liability\nis traded is closed, such asset or liability\nwill be valued using the prior day\u2019s price,\nprovided that BFA is not aware of any\nsignificant event or other information that\nwould cause such price to no longer reflect\nthe fair value of the asset or liability, in\nwhich case such asset or liability would be\ntreated as a Fair Value Asset. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5\nCommittee is responsible for reviewing and\napproving methodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition,\nthe Fund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of the Fund. The pricing of all\nFair Value Assets is subsequently reported to\nthe Board or a committee thereof. When\ndetermining the price for a Fair Value Asset,\nBFA will seek to determine the price that the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive from\nthe current sale of that asset or liability in\nan arm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on\nwhich the asset or liability is being valued,\nand does not seek to determine the price the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive for\nselling an asset or liability at a later time\nor if it holds the asset or liability to\nmaturity. Fair value determinations will be\nbased upon all available factors that BFA\ndeems relevant at the time of the\ndetermination, and may be based on analytical\nvalues determined by BFA using proprietary or\nthird-party valuation models. Fair value\nrepresents a good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset or liability. When\ndetermining the fair value of an investment,\none or more fair value methodologies may be\nused (depending on certain factors, including\nthe asset type). For example, the investment\nmay be initially priced based on the original\ncost of the investment or, alternatively,\nusing proprietary or third-party models that\nmay rely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\nThe Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect\nthe Fund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to the Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Fund,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, the Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including the\nFund.\n\n74\n\nIn return for such services, BFA may cause the\nFund to pay a higher commission than other\nbrokers would charge if BFA determines in good\nfaith that the commission is reasonable in\nrelation to the services provided. In\nselecting brokers or dealers to execute\nportfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain\nthe best price and most favorable execution\nfor the Fund and may take into account a\nvariety of factors including: (i) the size,\nnature and character of the security or\ninstrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time,\nthe Fund may purchase new issues of securities\nin a fixed price offering. In these\nsituations, the broker may be a member of the\nselling group that will, in addition to\nselling securities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). The\nFund anticipates that brokerage transactions\ninvolving foreign equity securities generally\nwill be conducted primarily on the principal\nstock exchanges of the applicable country.\nForeign equity securities may be held by the\nFund in the form of depositary receipts, or\nother securities convertible into foreign\nequity securities. Depositary receipts may be\nlisted on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC\nmarkets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may\nbe. ADRs, like other securities traded in the\nU.S., will be subject to negotiated commission\nrates. OTC issues, including most fixed-income\nsecurities such as corporate debt and U.S.\nGovernment securities, are normally traded on\na \u201c net \u201d basis without a stated commission,\nthrough dealers acting for their own account\nand not as brokers. The Fund will primarily\nengage in transactions with these dealers or\ndeal directly with the issuer unless a better\nprice or execution could be obtained by using\na broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect\nto both foreign and domestic securities will\ngenerally include a \u201c spread, \u201d which is the\ndifference between the prices at which the\ndealer is willing to purchase and sell the\nspecific security at the time, and includes\nthe dealer\u2019s normal profit. Under the 1940\nAct, persons affiliated with the Fund and\npersons who are affiliated with such\naffiliated persons are prohibited from dealing\nwith the Fund as principal in the purchase and\nsale of securities unless a permissive order\nallowing such transactions is obtained from\nthe SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market\nusually involve transactions with the dealers\nacting as principal for their own accounts,\nthe Fund will not deal with affiliated persons\nand affiliated persons of such affiliated\npersons in connection with such transactions.\nThe Fund will not purchase securities during\nthe existence of any underwriting or selling\ngroup relating to such securities of which\nBFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined\nin the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except\npursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in\naccordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.\nPurchases of money market instruments by the\nFund are made from dealers, underwriters and\nissuers. The Fund does not currently expect to\nincur any brokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\n\n75\n\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Fund\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Fund may invest. Initial public\nofferings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of securities may be\nover-subscribed and subsequently trade at a\npremium in the secondary market. When BFA is\ngiven an opportunity to invest in such an\ninitial offering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue,\nthe supply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in the Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the investment is eligible, portfolio\nmanagers may rotate such investment\nopportunities among one or more accounts so\nlong as the rotation system provides for fair\naccess for all client accounts over time.\nOther allocation methodologies that are\nconsidered by BFA to be fair and equitable to\nclients may be used as well. Because different\naccounts may have differing investment\nobjectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell\nthe same securities at the same time for\ndifferent clients based on the particular\ninvestment objective, guidelines and\nstrategies of those accounts. For example, BFA\nmay decide that it may be entirely appropriate\nfor a growth fund to sell a security at the\nsame time a value fund is buying that\nsecurity. To the extent that transactions on\nbehalf of more than one client of BFA or the\nother Affiliates during the same period\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, there may be an adverse effect on price.\nFor example, sales of a security by BlackRock\non behalf of one or more of its clients may\ndecrease the market price of such security,\nadversely impacting other BlackRock clients\nthat still hold the security. If purchases or\nsales of securities arise for consideration at\nor about the same time that would involve the\nFund or other clients or funds for which BFA\nor another Affiliate act as investment\nmanager, transactions in such securities will\nbe made, insofar as feasible, for the\nrespective funds and clients in a manner\ndeemed equitable to all. In certain instances,\nBFA may find it efficient for purposes of\nseeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate\nor \u201c bunch \u201d certain contemporaneous purchases\nor sale orders of its advisory accounts and\nadvisory accounts of affiliates. In general,\nall contemporaneous trades for client accounts\nunder management by the same portfolio manager\nor investment team will be bunched in a single\norder if the trader believes the bunched trade\nwould provide each client with an opportunity\nto achieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Fund is concerned,\nin other cases it could\n\n76\n\nbe beneficial to the Fund. Transactions\neffected by BFA or the other Affiliates on\nbehalf of more than one of its clients during\nthe same period may increase the demand for\nsecurities being purchased or the supply of\nsecurities being sold, causing an adverse\neffect on price. The trader will give the\nbunched order to the broker-dealer that the\ntrader has identified as being able to provide\nthe best execution of the order. Orders for\npurchase or sale of securities will be placed\nwithin a reasonable amount of time of the\norder receipt and bunched orders will be kept\nbunched only long enough to execute the order.\nThe table below sets forth the brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Fund for the fiscal\nyears noted. Any differences in brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Fund from year to year\nare principally due to increases or decreases\nin the Fund\u2019s assets over those periods or the\nmagnitude of changes to the components of the\nFund's Underlying Index:\n                                              \n            Brokerag\u2026  Brokerage\u2026  Brokerag\u2026  \n            DuringFi\u2026  DuringFis\u2026  DuringFi\u2026  \n            YearEnded   YearEnded  YearEnded  \n              October     October    October  \n  FundInc\u2026   31, 2023    31, 2022   31, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  04/22/14     $8,921     $13,830    $17,207  \n                                              \nThe Fund did not pay any brokerage commissions\nto BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, or to any other\nbroker-dealer that is part of the BlackRock\ngroup of companies, during the fiscal year\nended October 31, 2023. The Fund's purchase\nand sale orders for securities may be combined\nwith those of other investment companies,\nclients or accounts that BlackRock manages or\nadvises. If purchases or sales of portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund and one or more other\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock are\nconsidered at or about the same time,\ntransactions in such securities are allocated\namong the Fund and the other accounts in a\nmanner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock.\nIn some cases, this procedure could have a\ndetrimental effect on the price or volume of\nthe security as far as the Fund is concerned.\nHowever, in other cases, it is possible that\nthe ability to participate in volume\ntransactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFund. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for\nits own account in the types of securities in\nwhich the Fund may invest. BlackRock may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Fund\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses. The table below\nsets forth the portfolio turnover rates of the\nFund for the fiscal years noted:\n                                              \n  Fiscal Year          Fiscal Year endedOct.  \n  endedOct. 31, 2023   31, 2022               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  39%                  74%                    \n                                              \nAdditional Information Concerning the Trust\nShares. The Trust issues shares of beneficial\ninterests in the funds with no par value. The\nBoard may designate additional iShares funds.\nEach share issued by a fund has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of that fund. Shares\nhave no preemptive, exchange, subscription or\nconversion rights and are freely transferable.\nEach share is entitled to participate equally\nin dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to the relevant fund, and\nin the net distributable assets of such fund\non liquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\n\n77\n\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders. Following the creation of the\ninitial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund\nand immediately prior to the commencement of\ntrading in such fund\u2019s shares, a holder of\nshares may be a \u201c control person \u201d of the\nfund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940\nAct. A fund cannot predict the length of time\nfor which one or more shareholders may remain\na control person of the fund. Shareholders may\nmake inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,\nc/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University\nSquare Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540. Absent an\napplicable exemption or other relief from the\nSEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more\nthan 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject\nto the reporting provisions of Section 13 of\nthe 1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould consult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff. In accordance with\nthe Trust's current Agreement and Declaration\nof Trust (the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the\nBoard may, without shareholder approval\n(unless such shareholder approval is required\nby the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Fund. Shares of\nthe Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee\n\n78\n\nto be charged to the Trust a listing of the\nshares of the Fund held by each DTC\nParticipant. The Trust shall inquire of each\nsuch DTC Participant as to the number of\nBeneficial Owners holding shares, directly or\nindirectly, through such DTC Participant. The\nTrust shall provide each such DTC Participant\nwith copies of such notice, statement or other\ncommunication, in such form, number and at\nsuch place as such DTC Participant may\nreasonably request, in order that such notice,\nstatement or communication may be transmitted\nby such DTC Participant, directly or\nindirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In\naddition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC\nParticipant a fair and reasonable amount as\nreimbursement for the expenses attendant to\nsuch transmittal, all subject to applicable\nstatutory and regulatory requirements. Share\ndistributions shall be made to DTC or its\nnominee, Cede & Co., as the registered holder\nof all shares of the Trust. DTC or its\nnominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with the Fund's\nlaunch, the Fund was seeded through the sale\nof one or more Creation Units by the Fund to\none or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof the Fund or the Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor the Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nThe Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\nthe Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund's NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the Listing Exchange or the bond\nmarkets close earlier than normal, the Fund\nmay require orders to be placed earlier in the\nday. The following table sets forth the number\nof shares of the Fund that constitute a\nCreation Unit for the Fund and the approximate\nvalue of such Creation Unit as of November 30,\n2023:\n\n79\n                                              \n  Shares PerCreation        ApproximateValue  \n  Unit                       PerCreationUnit  \n                                     (U.S.$)  \n  50,000                       $1,053,977.40  \n                                              \nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of\nthe Fund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation\nUnit. The Board reserves the right to declare\na split or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of the Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board. A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\nthe Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. The Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\nthe Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of the Fund\ngenerally consists of the Deposit Securities\nand the Cash Component computed as described\nbelow. Together, the Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component constitute the \u201c Fund\nDeposit, \u201d which, when combined with the\nFund's portfolio securities, is designed to\ngenerate performance that has a collective\ninvestment profile similar to that of the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents\nthe minimum initial and subsequent investment\namount for a Creation Unit of the Fund. Such\nFund Deposit is applicable, subject to any\nadjustments as described below, to purchases\nof Creation Units of shares of a given Fund\nuntil such time as the next-announced Fund\nDeposit is made available. The Cash Component\nis an amount equal to the difference between\nthe NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and\nthe \u201c Deposit Amount, \u201d which is an amount\nequal to the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities, and serves to compensate for any\ndifferences between the NAV per Creation Unit\nand the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp\nduty or other similar fees and expenses\npayable upon transfer of beneficial ownership\nof the Deposit Securities are the sole\nresponsibility of the Authorized Participant\npurchasing the Creation Unit. The identity and\nnumber or par value of the Deposit Securities\nchange pursuant to changes in the composition\nof the Fund's portfolio and as rebalancing\nadjustments and corporate action events are\nreflected from time to time by BFA with a view\nto the investment objective of the Fund. The\ncomposition of the Deposit Securities may also\nchange in response to adjustments to the\nweighting or composition of the component\nsecurities constituting the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund Deposit may also be modified to\nminimize the Cash Component by redistributing\nthe cash to the Deposit Securities portion of\nthe Fund Deposit through \u201c systematic\nrounding. \u201d The rounding methodology \u201c rounds\nup \u201d position sizes of securities in the\nDeposit Securities (which in turn reduces the\ncash portion). However, the methodology limits\nthe maximum allowed percentage change in\nweight and share quantity of any given\nsecurity in the Fund Deposit. Fund Deposits\nmay also be modified to position a fund\ntowards a forward index rebalance to reflect\nrevisions that account for index additions,\ndeletions, and re-weights. The Trust may, in\nits sole discretion, substitute a \u201c cash in\nlieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash\nComponent to replace any Deposit Security in\ncertain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by the Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations.\n\n80\n\nCash Purchase Method. Although the Trust does\nnot generally permit partial or full cash\npurchases of Creation Units of its funds, when\npartial or full cash purchases of Creation\nUnits are available or specified for the Fund,\nthey will be effected in essentially the same\nmanner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the\ncase of a partial or full cash purchase, the\nAuthorized Participant must pay the cash\nequivalent of the Deposit Securities it would\notherwise be required to provide through an\nin-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Fund, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units is referred to as an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant. \u201d All shares of the\nFund, however created, will be entered on the\nrecords of DTC in the name of Cede & Co. for\nthe account of a DTC Participant. Role of the\nAuthorized Participant. Creation Units may be\npurchased only by or through a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units (an \u201c Authorized Participant\n\u201d ). Such Authorized Participant will agree,\npursuant to the terms of such Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and on behalf of itself\nor any investor on whose behalf it will act,\nto certain conditions, including that such\nAuthorized Participant will make available in\nadvance of each purchase of shares an amount\nof cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component,\nonce the NAV of a Creation Unit is next\ndetermined after receipt of the purchase order\nin proper form, together with the transaction\nfees described below. An Authorized\nParticipant, acting on behalf of an investor,\nmay require the investor to enter into an\nagreement with such Authorized Participant\nwith respect to certain matters, including\npayment of the Cash Component. Investors who\nare not Authorized Participants must make\nappropriate arrangements with an Authorized\nParticipant. Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not be a DTC\nParticipant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\nAuthorized Participant. As a result, purchase\norders placed through an Authorized\nParticipant may result in additional charges\nto such investor. The Trust does not expect to\nenter into an Authorized Participant Agreement\nwith more than a small number of DTC\nParticipants. A list of current Authorized\nParticipants may be obtained from the\nDistributor. The Distributor has adopted\nguidelines regarding Authorized Participants\u2019\ntransactions in Creation Units that are made\navailable to all Authorized Participants.\nThese guidelines set forth the processes and\nstandards for Authorized Participants to\ntransact with the Distributor and its agents\nin connection with creation and redemption\ntransactions. In addition, the Distributor may\nbe appointed as the proxy of the Authorized\nParticipant and may be granted a power of\nattorney under its Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Purchase Orders. To initiate an\norder for a Creation Unit, an Authorized\nParticipant must submit to the Distributor or\nits agent an irrevocable order to purchase\nshares of the Fund, in proper form, generally\nbefore 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business\nDay to receive that day\u2019s NAV. The Distributor\nor its agent will notify BFA and the custodian\nof such order. The custodian will then provide\nsuch information to any appropriate sub-\ncustodian. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning the delivery of the Fund Deposit are\nset forth in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time. Investors, other than Authorized\nParticipants, are responsible for making\narrangements for a creation request to be made\nthrough an Authorized Participant. The\nDistributor or its agent will provide a list\nof current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFund, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Fund to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\ndeadline for cash transfers by contacting the\noperations department of the broker or\ndepositary institution effectuating the\ntransfer of the Cash Component. This deadline\nis likely to be significantly earlier than the\nCutoff Time of the Fund. Investors should be\naware that an Authorized Participant may\nrequire orders for purchases of shares placed\nwith it to be in the particular form required\nby the individual Authorized Participant.\n\n81\n\nThe Authorized Participant is responsible for\nany and all expenses and costs incurred by the\nFund, including any applicable cash amounts,\nin connection with any purchase order. Timing\nof Submission of Purchase Orders. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable order to purchase shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Fund to the Distributor or its\nagent pursuant to procedures set forth in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement. Economic or\nmarket disruptions or changes, or telephone or\nother communication failure, may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or its agent\nor an Authorized Participant. Orders to create\nshares of the Fund that are submitted on the\nBusiness Day immediately preceding a holiday\nor a day (other than a weekend) when the\nequity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market\nare closed may not be accepted. The Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as the Fund's \u201c\nCutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with the\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Fund are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFund will accept the order, subject to the\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once the Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. The Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, the Fund may reject or revoke a\ncreation order transmitted to it by the\nDistributor or its agent if (i) the order is\nnot in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding shares of\nthe Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not conform to the identity and\nnumber of shares specified, as described\nabove; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit\nSecurities is not legally required or would,\nin the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; or (v)\ncircumstances outside the control of the Fund,\nthe Distributor or its agent and BFA make it\nimpracticable to process purchase orders. The\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a\nprospective purchaser of a Creation Unit\nand/or the Authorized Participant acting on\nbehalf of such purchaser of its rejection of\nsuch order. The Fund, JPMorgan, the sub-\ncustodian and the Distributor or its agent are\nunder no duty, however, to give notification\nof any defects or irregularities in the\ndelivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of\nthem incur any liability for failure to give\nsuch notification. Issuance of a Creation\nUnit. Except as provided herein, a Creation\nUnit will not be issued until the transfer of\ngood title to the Fund of the Deposit\nSecurities and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the sub-\ncustodian has confirmed to the custodian that\nthe securities included in the Fund Deposit\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant sub-\ncustodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor\nor its agent and BFA shall be notified of such\ndelivery and the Fund will issue and cause the\ndelivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units\nare generally issued on a \u201c T+1 basis \u201d ( i.e.\n, one Business Day after trade date). The Fund\nreserves the right to settle Creation Unit\ntransactions on a basis other than T+1,\nincluding a shorter settlement period, if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. To the extent contemplated by an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement with the\nDistributor, the Fund will issue Creation\nUnits to such Authorized Participant,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the\ncorresponding Fund Deposits have not been\nreceived in part or in whole, in reliance on\nthe undertaking of the Authorized Participant\nto deliver the missing Deposit Securities as\nsoon as possible, which undertaking shall be\nsecured by such Authorized Participant's\ndelivery and maintenance of collateral as set\nforth in the handbook for Authorized\nParticipants. The Trust may use such\ncollateral at any time to buy Deposit\nSecurities for the Fund. Such collateral must\nbe delivered no later than the time specified\nby the Fund or its custodian on the\ncontractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Fund's current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Fund to buy the\nmissing\n\n82\n\nDeposit Securities at any time and will\nsubject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Fund of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges. In certain cases,\nAuthorized Participants may create and redeem\nCreation Units on the same trade date and in\nthese instances, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle these transactions on a net basis or\nrequire a representation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by the\nFund and the Fund's determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the\nFund has retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA,\nto perform certain ETF Services. BRIL will\nreceive from an Authorized Participant a\nstandard transaction fee on each creation\norder, which consists of (1) a fee for\nproviding the ETF Services (the \u201c ETF\nServicing Fee \u201d ) and (2) transfer, processing\nand other transaction costs charged by a Fund\ncustodian in connection with the issuance of\nCreation Units for such creation order ( \u201c\nCustody Transaction Costs \u201d ). BRIL is\nentitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee\npursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but\nBRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction\nCosts to the applicable Fund custodian\naccording to the amounts invoiced by such\ncustodian. The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee\nper order regardless of the number of Creation\nUnits being purchased, which amount will vary\namong different Funds based on a number of\nfactors, including the complexity of the order\nand the types of securities or instruments\nincluded in a Fund\u2019s Creation Basket, among\nother variables. The actual Custody\nTransaction Costs vary per order based on the\nnumber of trades, underlying markets and\nsettlement locations associated with the\nissuance of a Creation Unit. The following\ntable sets forth, either the actual creation\ntransaction fee that was charged on December\n31, 2023 or an estimate of the creation\ntransaction fee that would have been charged\nif the Fund had issued a Creation Unit on that\ndate. The actual fee that was or would have\nbeen charged to an Authorized Participant in\nconnection with a creation order will vary\nover time depending on the factors discussed\nabove, and may be higher than the fee set\nforth below. In order to defray transaction\nexpenses for the Fund and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, if a creation\ntransaction consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution and other costs and\nexpenses related to the execution of trades\nresulting from such transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread between the expected bid\nand offer side of the market and anticipated\nmarket impact). However, the Fund is not\nobligated to trade identical securities to the\nsecurities identified by BlackRock in\nestimating these transaction and other costs\nand expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or\nan affiliate may determine in its discretion\nto deviate from the regular charge, subject to\nthe maximum amounts shown below. Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Deposit Securities to the\nFund. Certain fees/costs associated with\ncreation transactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\nacquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for\nsuch services. The following table sets forth\nthe Fund's actual or estimated creation\ntransaction fee, as applicable, as of December\n31, 2023 and maximum additional charge (as\ndescribed above):\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  CreationTransaction   AdditionalCharge*     \n  Fee                                         \n  $158.75**             3.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit. ** Estimated fee. Redemption of\nCreation Units. Shares of the Fund may be\nredeemed by Authorized Participants only in\nCreation Units at their NAV next determined\nafter receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form by the Distributor or its agent\nand only on a Business Day. The Fund will not\nredeem shares in amounts less than Creation\nUnits. There can be no assurance, however,\n\n83\n\nthat there will be sufficient liquidity in the\nsecondary market at any time to permit\nassembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should\nexpect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number\nof shares to constitute a Creation Unit that\ncould be redeemed by an Authorized\nParticipant. Beneficial owners also may sell\nshares in the secondary market. The Fund\ngenerally redeems Creation Units for Fund\nSecurities (as defined below). Please see the\nCash Redemption Method section below and the\nfollowing discussion summarizing the in-kind\nmethod for further information on redeeming\nCreation Units of the Fund. The Fund publishes\nthe designated portfolio of securities\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) that will be\napplicable to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day ( \u201c\nFund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption Basket \u201d ),\nand an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash Amount, \u201d as\ndescribed below) in order to effect\nredemptions of Creation Units of the Fund.\nSuch Fund Securities and Cash Amount will\nremain in effect until such time as the next\nannounced composition of the Fund Securities\nand Cash Amount is made available. The Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount are subject to\npossible amendment or correction. Fund\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. Unless cash\nredemptions are available or specified for the\nFund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit generally consist of Fund Securities,\nplus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal\nto the difference between the NAV of the\nshares being redeemed, as next determined\nafter the receipt of a redemption request in\nproper form, and the value of Fund Securities,\nless a redemption transaction fee (as\ndescribed below). The Trust may, in its sole\ndiscretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. The Fund generally\nredeems Creation Units for Fund Securities,\nbut the Fund reserves the right to utilize a\ncash option for redemption of Creation Units.\nThe Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide\nsuch redeeming Authorized Participant a\nportfolio of securities that differs from the\nexact composition of the Fund Securities, but\ndoes not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket\nmay also be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index rebalance to reflect revisions\nthat account for index additions, deletions,\nand re-weights. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\npartial or full cash redemptions of Creation\nUnits of its funds, when partial or full cash\nredemptions of Creation Units are available or\nspecified for the Fund, they will be effected\nin essentially the same manner as in-kind\nredemptions thereof. In the case of partial or\nfull cash redemption, the Authorized\nParticipant receives the cash equivalent of\nthe Fund Securities it would otherwise receive\nthrough an in-kind redemption, plus the same\nCash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\nA standard redemption transaction fee is\nimposed to offset transfer and other\ntransaction costs that may be incurred by the\nFund. As described above, under an ETF\nServices Agreement, the Fund has retained\nBRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform certain\nETF Services. BRIL will receive from an\nAuthorized Participant a standard transaction\nfee on each redemption order, which consists\nof (1) the ETF Servicing Fee and (2) Custody\nTransaction Costs. BRIL is entitled to retain\nthe ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF\nServices Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse\nany Custody Transaction Costs to the\napplicable Fund custodian according to the\namounts invoiced by such custodian.\n\n84\n\nThe ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee per order\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing redeemed, which amount will vary among\ndifferent Funds based on a number of factors,\nincluding the complexity of the order and the\ntypes of securities or instruments included in\na Fund\u2019s Redemption Basket, among other\nvariables. The actual Custody Transaction\nCosts vary per order based on the number of\ntrades, underlying markets, and settlement\nlocations associated with the redemption of a\nCreation Unit. The following table sets forth\neither the actual standard redemption\ntransaction fee that was charged on December\n31, 2023 or an estimate of the standard\nredemption transaction fee that would have\nbeen charged if the Fund had redeemed a\nCreation Unit on that date. The actual fee\nthat was or would have been charged to an\nAuthorized Participant in connection with a\nredemption order will vary over time depending\non the factors discussed above, and may be\nhigher than the fee set forth below. In order\nto defray transaction expenses for the Fund\nand protect against possible shareholder\ndilution, if a redemption transaction consists\nsolely or partially of cash, the Authorized\nParticipant may also be required to cover (up\nto the maximum amount shown below) certain\nbrokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution\nand other costs and expenses related to the\nexecution of trades resulting from such\ntransaction (which may, in certain instances,\nbe based on a good faith estimate of\ntransaction costs based on historical data or\nother inputs, at BlackRock\u2019s discretion, and\nmay include part or all of the spread between\nthe expected bid and offer side of the market\nand anticipated market impact). However, the\nFund is not obligated to trade identical\nsecurities to the securities identified by\nBlackRock in estimating these transaction and\nother costs and expenses. In certain cases,\nBlackRock or an affiliate may determine in its\ndiscretion to deviate from the regular charge,\nsubject to the maximum amounts shown below.\nAuthorized Participants will also bear the\ncosts of transferring the Fund Securities from\nthe Fund to their account on their order.\nCertain fees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\ndispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee\nfor such services. The following table sets\nforth the Fund's actual or estimated\nredemption transaction fee, as applicable, as\nof December 31, 2023 and maximum additional\ncharge (as described above):\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  RedemptionTransacti\u2026  AdditionalCharge*     \n  Fee                                         \n  $158.75**             2.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\nredemption transaction fee. ** Estimated fee.\nPlacement of Redemption Orders. Redemption\nrequests for Creation Units of the Fund must\nbe submitted to the Distributor or its agent\nby or through an Authorized Participant. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable request to redeem shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, the Fund may\nrequire orders to redeem Creation Units to be\nplaced earlier that day. Investors, other than\nAuthorized Participants, are responsible for\nmaking arrangements for a redemption request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. The Authorized Participant must\ntransmit the request for redemption in the\nform required by the Fund to the Distributor\nor its agent in accordance with procedures set\nforth in the Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that,\ntherefore, requests to redeem Creation Units\nmay have to be placed by the investor's broker\nthrough an Authorized Participant who has\nexecuted an Authorized Participant Agreement.\nAt any time, only a limited number of broker-\ndealers will have an Authorized Participant\nAgreement in effect. Investors making a\nredemption request should be aware that such\nrequest must be in the form specified by such\nAuthorized Participant. Investors making a\nrequest to redeem Creation Units should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe request by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Fund's transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Fund's\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\n\n85\n\nrequest in form satisfactory to the Fund is\nreceived by the Distributor or its agent from\nthe Authorized Participant on behalf of itself\nor another redeeming investor within the time\nperiods specified above; and (iii) all other\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement are properly followed.\nUpon receiving a redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent shall notify the Fund\nand the Fund's transfer agent of such\nredemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds by the Fund are generally made within\none Business Day ( i.e ., \u201c T+1 \u201d ). The Fund\nreserves the right to settle redemption\ntransactions on a basis other than T+1, if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. Delayed settlement may occur due to a\nnumber of different reasons, including,\nwithout limitation, settlement cycles for the\nunderlying securities, unscheduled market\nclosings, an effort to link distribution to\ndividend record dates and ex-dates and newly\nannounced holidays. For example, the\nredemption settlement process may be extended\nbeyond T+1 because of the occurrence of a\nholiday in a non-U.S. market or in the U.S.\nbond market that is not a holiday observed in\nthe U.S. equity market. If neither the\nAuthorized Participant nor the Beneficial\nOwner on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting has appropriate\narrangements to take delivery of Fund\nSecurities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, the Fund may\nin its discretion exercise its option to\nredeem such shares in cash, and the redeeming\nBeneficial Owner will be required to receive\nits redemption proceeds in cash. In such case,\nthe investor will receive a cash payment equal\nto the net asset value of its shares based on\nthe NAV of the Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charges specified above to offset\nthe Fund's brokerage and other transaction\ncosts associated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and the Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right\nto redeem Creation Units for cash to the\nextent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver\nspecific Fund Securities upon redemptions or\ncannot do so without first registering the\nFund Securities under such laws. Although the\nTrust does not ordinarily permit cash\nredemptions of Creation Units, in the event\nthat cash redemptions are permitted or\nrequired by the Trust, proceeds will be paid\nto the Authorized Participant redeeming shares\nas soon as practicable after the date of\nredemption (within seven calendar days\nthereafter). If the Fund includes a foreign\ninvestment in its basket, and if a local\nmarket holiday, or series of consecutive\nholidays, or the extended delivery cycles for\ntransferring foreign investments to redeeming\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of the foreign investment in response\nto a redemption request, the Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if the Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant's\nagreement with the Distributor or its agent,\nin the event an Authorized Participant has\nsubmitted a redemption request in proper form\nbut is unable to transfer all or part of the\nCreation Unit to be redeemed to the Fund, at\nor prior to the time specified by the Fund or\nits custodian on the Business Day after the\ndate of submission of such redemption request,\nthe Distributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business Day after the date of submission\nof such redemption request and shall be held\nby JPMorgan and marked-to-market daily. The\nfees of JPMorgan and any sub-custodians in\nrespect of the delivery, maintenance and\nredelivery of the collateral shall be payable\nby the Authorized Participant. The Authorized\nParticipant Agreement permits the Fund to\nacquire shares of the Fund at any time and\nsubjects the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the\naggregate of the cost to the Fund of\npurchasing such shares, plus the value of the\nCash Amount, and the value of the collateral\ntogether with liability for related brokerage\nand other charges.\n\n86\n\nBecause the portfolio securities of the Fund\nmay trade on exchange(s) on days that the\nListing Exchange is closed or are otherwise\nnot Business Days for the Fund, shareholders\nmay not be able to redeem their shares of the\nFund or purchase or sell shares of the Fund on\nthe Listing Exchange on days when the NAV of\nthe Fund could be significantly affected by\nevents in the relevant non-U.S. markets. The\nright of redemption may be suspended or the\ndate of payment postponed with respect to the\nFund: (i) for any period during which the\nListing Exchange is closed (other than\ncustomary weekend and holiday closings); (ii)\nfor any period during which trading on the\nListing Exchange is suspended or restricted;\n(iii) for any period during which an emergency\nexists as a result of which disposal of the\nshares of the Fund's portfolio securities or\ndetermination of its NAV is not reasonably\npracticable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Fund will accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\nthe Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. The Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of the Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of the Fund may be taken\ninto account. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for the Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Fund, as set forth in the\nFund's policies and procedures. Taxation on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units.\nAn Authorized Participant generally will\nrecognize either gain or loss upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits. This gain or loss is calculated by\ntaking the market value of the Creation Units\npurchased over the Authorized Participant\u2019s\naggregate basis in the Deposit Securities\nexchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply\nthe wash sales rules to determine that any\nloss realized upon the exchange of Deposit\nSecurities for Creation Units is not currently\ndeductible. Authorized Participants should\nconsult their own tax advisors. Current U.S.\nfederal income tax laws dictate that capital\ngain or loss realized from the redemption of\nCreation Units will generally create long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Creation Units for more\nthan one year, or short-term capital gain or\nloss if the Creation Units were held for one\nyear or less, if the Creation Units are held\nas capital assets.\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of the\nFund. This summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to the Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in the\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. References to the Fund\nwill also generally apply to the Underlying\nFunds as well. Regulated Investment Company\nQualifications. The Fund intends to qualify\nfor treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of the\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of the\n\n87\n\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of the Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of the\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. The Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, the Fund fails one of these\ntests and does not timely cure the failure,\nthe Fund will be taxed in the same manner as\nan ordinary corporation and distributions to\nits shareholders will not be deductible by the\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. The\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, the Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, the Fund\nmust distribute to its shareholders at least\nthe sum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than its\nnet realized long-term capital gain over its\nnet realized short-term capital loss), plus or\nminus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its\nnet tax-exempt income for the taxable year.\nThe Fund will be subject to income tax at\nregular corporate rates on any taxable income\nor gains that it does not distribute to its\nshareholders. If the Fund fails to qualify for\nany taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the\ndistribution requirement, all of its taxable\nincome will be subject to tax at regular\ncorporate income tax rates without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand such distributions generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends\nto the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although the\nFund intends to distribute substantially all\nof its net investment income and its capital\ngains for each taxable year, the Fund may\ndecide to retain a portion of its income or\ngains if the Fund determines that doing so is\nin the interest of its shareholders. The Fund\nwill be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. If the Fund fails\nto qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay\nout its earnings and profits accumulated in\nthat year in order to qualify again as a RIC.\nIf the Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a\nperiod greater than two taxable years, the\nFund may be required to recognize any net\nbuilt-in gains with respect to certain of its\nassets ( i.e., the excess of the aggregate\ngains, including items of income, over\naggregate losses that would have been realized\nwith respect to such assets if the Fund had\nbeen liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Short-term capital gain\nearned by the Underlying Fund will be ordinary\nincome when distributed to the Fund and will\nnot be offset by the Fund\u2019s capital losses.\nUpon the sale or other disposition by the Fund\nof shares of the Underlying Fund, the Fund\nwill realize a capital gain or loss which will\nbe long-term or short-term, generally\ndepending on the Fund\u2019s holding period for the\nshares. Losses realized upon such redemptions\nmay result in a substantial number of \u201c wash\nsales \u201d and deferral, perhaps indefinitely, of\nrealized losses to the Fund. Excise Tax. The\nFund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on\ncertain undistributed income if it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders in each\ncalendar year at least 98% of its ordinary\nincome for the calendar year plus at least\n98.2% of its capital gain net income for the\n12 months ended October 31 of such year. For\nthis purpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by the Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. The Fund intends to declare and\ndistribute dividends and distributions in the\namounts and at the times necessary to avoid\nthe application of this 4% excise tax. Long-\nterm capital distributions from the Underlying\nFunds paid in December or, in certain cases,\nJanuary in satisfaction of this rule will be\nsubject to potential distribution by the Fund\nin the following calendar year.\n\n88\n\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards. Net capital\nloss carryforwards may be applied against any\nnet realized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that the Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of the Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds, if any, may be subject to\nlimitation. As of October 31, 2023, the tax\nyear-end of the Fund, the Fund had non-\nexpiring capital loss carryforwards in the\namount of $8,534,376 available to offset\nfuture realized capital gains. Taxation of\nU.S. Shareholders. Dividends and other\ndistributions by the Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by the Fund\nin October, November or December of any\ncalendar year and payable to shareholders of\nrecord on a specified date in such a month\nshall be deemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if the Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\nthe Fund reports as capital gains dividends\nare taxable as long-term capital gains,\nwhether paid in cash or in shares and\nregardless of how long a shareholder has held\nshares of the Fund. All other dividends of the\nFund (including dividends from short-term\ncapital gains) from its current and\naccumulated earnings and profits ( \u201c regular\ndividends \u201d ) are generally subject to tax as\nordinary income, subject to the discussion of\nqualified dividend income below. Short-term\ncapital gains earned by an Underlying Fund\nwill be ordinary income when distributed to\nthe Fund and will not be offset by the Fund\u2019s\ncapital losses. Long-term capital gains are\neligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15%\nor 20% for non-corporate shareholders,\ndepending on whether their income exceeds\ncertain threshold amounts. If an individual\nreceives a regular dividend qualifying for the\nlong-term capital gains rates and such\ndividend constitutes an \u201c extraordinary\ndividend, \u201d and the individual subsequently\nrecognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of\nstock in respect of which the extraordinary\ndividend was paid, then the loss will be long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of such\nextraordinary dividend. An \u201c extraordinary\ndividend \u201d on common stock for this purpose is\ngenerally a dividend (i) in an amount greater\nthan or equal to 10% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax\nbasis (or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount\ngreater than 20% of the taxpayer\u2019s tax basis\n(or trading value) in a share of stock,\naggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates\nwithin a 365-day period. Distributions in\nexcess of the Fund\u2019s current and accumulated\nearnings and profits will, as to each\nshareholder, be treated as a tax-free return\nof capital to the extent of a shareholder\u2019s\nbasis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital\ngain thereafter (if the shareholder holds\nshares of the Fund as capital assets).\nDistributions in excess of the Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but not in excess\nof the Fund\u2019s earnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will not\nconstitute nontaxable returns of capital.\nShareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. Dividends paid by the Fund that\nare attributable to dividends received by an\nUnderlying Fund from domestic corporations may\nqualify for the federal dividends received\ndeduction for corporations.\n\n89\n\nA 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax\nis imposed on net investment income,\nincluding, but not limited to, interest,\ndividends, and net gain from investments, of\nU.S. individuals with income exceeding\n$200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing\njointly) and of estates and trusts. Investors\nconsidering buying shares just prior to a\ndividend or capital gain distribution should\nbe aware that, although the price of shares\npurchased at that time may reflect the amount\nof the forthcoming distribution, such dividend\nor distribution may nevertheless be taxable to\nthem. If the Fund is the holder of record of\nany security on the record date for any\ndividends payable with respect to such\nsecurity, such dividends will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income not as of the date\nreceived but as of the later of (a) the date\nsuch security became ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividends ( i.e. , the date on which a\nbuyer of the security would not be entitled to\nreceive the declared, but unpaid, dividends);\nor (b) the date the Fund acquired such\nsecurity. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its\nincome distribution requirements, the Fund may\nbe required to pay dividends based on\nanticipated earnings, and shareholders may\nreceive dividends in an earlier year than\nwould otherwise be the case. In certain\nsituations, the Fund may, for a taxable year,\ndefer all or a portion of its net capital loss\n(or if there is no net capital loss, then any\nnet long-term or short-term capital loss)\nrealized after October and its late-year\nordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the\nexcess of post-October foreign currency and\npassive foreign investment company ( \u201c PFIC \u201d\n) losses over post-October foreign currency\nand PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-\nDecember ordinary losses over post-December\nordinary income) until the next taxable year\nin computing its investment company taxable\nincome and net capital gain, which will defer\nthe recognition of such realized losses. Such\ndeferrals and other rules regarding gains and\nlosses realized after October (or December)\nmay affect the tax character of shareholder\ndistributions. Sales of Shares. Upon the sale\nor exchange of shares of the Fund, a\nshareholder will realize a taxable gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the\namount realized and the shareholder\u2019s basis in\nshares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by\nthe Fund will be treated as a sale for this\npurpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are capital\nassets in the shareholder\u2019s hands and will be\nlong-term capital gain or loss if the shares\nare held for more than one year and short-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor one year or less. Any loss realized on a\nsale or exchange will be disallowed to the\nextent the shares disposed of are replaced,\nincluding replacement through the reinvesting\nof dividends or capital gains distributions,\nor by an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of the Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the same rule also applies to a\ndisposition of the newly acquired shares made\nwithin 90 days of the second acquisition. This\nprovision prevents shareholders from\nimmediately deducting the sales charge by\nshifting their investments within a family of\nmutual funds. Backup Withholding. In certain\ncases, the Fund will be required to withhold\nat a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury\nsuch amounts withheld from any distributions\npaid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to\nprovide a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber; (ii) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to the\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding; or (iv) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person\n(including a U.S. resident alien). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax and any\namount withheld may be credited against a\nshareholder's U.S. federal income tax\nliability. Sections 351 and 362. The Trust, on\nbehalf of the Fund, has the right to reject an\norder for a purchase of shares of the Fund if\nthe purchaser (or group of purchasers) would,\nupon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80%\nor more of the outstanding shares of the Fund\nand if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, the Fund would have\na basis in the securities different from the\nmarket value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. If the Fund\u2019s basis in such\nsecurities on the date of deposit was less\nthan market value on such date, the Fund, upon\ndisposition of the securities, would recognize\nmore taxable gain or less taxable loss than if\nits basis in the securities had been equal to\nmarket value. It is not anticipated\n\n90\n\nthat the Trust will exercise the right of\nrejection except in a case where the Trust\ndetermines that accepting the order could\nresult in material adverse tax consequences to\nthe Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also\nhas the right to require information necessary\nto determine beneficial share ownership for\npurposes of the 80% determination. Taxation of\nCertain Derivatives. An Underlying Fund\u2019s\ntransactions in zero coupon securities,\nnon-U.S. currencies, forward contracts,\noptions and futures contracts (including\noptions and futures contracts on non-U.S.\ncurrencies), to the extent permitted, will be\nsubject to special provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code (including provisions relating to\n\u201c hedging transactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d )\nthat, among other consequences, may affect the\ncharacter of gains and losses realized by the\nFund ( i.e. , may affect whether gains or\nlosses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer\nFund losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also (a) will require each\nUnderlying Fund to mark-to-market certain\ntypes of the positions in its portfolio ( i.e.\n, treat them as if they were closed out at the\nend of each year) and (b) may cause an\nUnderlying Fund to recognize income without\nreceiving cash with which to pay dividends or\nmake distributions in amounts necessary to\nsatisfy the distribution requirements for\navoiding income and excise taxes. The Fund and\neach Underlying Fund will monitor its\ntransactions, will make the appropriate tax\nelections and will make the appropriate\nentries in its books and records when it\nacquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S.\ncurrency, forward contract, option, futures\ncontract or hedged investment in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and prevent\ndisqualification of an Underlying Fund as a\nRIC. An Underlying Fund\u2019s investments in so-\ncalled \u201c Section 1256 contracts, \u201d such as\nregulated futures contracts, most non-U.S.\ncurrency forward contracts traded in the\ninterbank market and options on most security\nindexes, are subject to special tax rules. All\nSection 1256 contracts held by an Underlying\nFund at the end of its taxable year are\nrequired to be marked to their market value,\nand any unrealized gain or loss on those\npositions will be included in an Underlying\nFund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by an Underlying Fund from positions\nin Section 1256 contracts closed during the\ntaxable year. Provided such positions were\nheld as capital assets and were not part of a\n\u201c hedging transaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c\nstraddle, \u201d 60% of the resulting net gain or\nloss will be treated as long-term capital gain\nor loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will\nbe treated as short-term capital gain or loss,\nregardless of the period of time the positions\nwere actually held by an Underlying Fund. As a\nresult of entering into swap contracts, an\nUnderlying Fund may make or receive periodic\nnet payments. An Underlying Fund may also make\nor receive a payment when a swap is terminated\nprior to maturity through an assignment of the\nswap or other closing transaction. Periodic\nnet payments will generally constitute\nordinary income or deductions, while\ntermination of a swap will generally result in\ncapital gain or loss (which will be a long-\nterm capital gain or loss if an Underlying\nFund has been a party to the swap for more\nthan one year). With respect to certain types\nof swaps, an Underlying Fund may be required\nto currently recognize income or loss with\nrespect to future payments on such swaps or\nmay elect under certain circumstances to mark\nsuch swaps to market annually for tax purposes\nas ordinary income or loss. Qualified Dividend\nIncome. Distributions by the Fund of\ninvestment company taxable income (including\nany short-term capital gains), whether\nreceived in cash or shares, will be taxable\neither as ordinary income or as qualified\ndividend income, which is eligible to be taxed\nat long-term capital gain rates to the extent\nthe Fund receives qualified dividend income on\nthe securities it holds and the Fund reports\nthe distribution as qualified dividend income.\nQualified dividend income is, in general,\ndividend income from taxable U.S. corporations\n(but generally not from U.S. REITs) and\ncertain non-U.S. corporations ( e.g. ,\nnon-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and\nwhich are incorporated in a possession of the\nU.S. or in certain countries with a\ncomprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the\nstock of which is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the U.S.\n(where the dividends are paid with respect to\nsuch stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the\nU.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax\ntreaties with the following countries:\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados,\nBelgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China (but not with\nHong Kong, which is treated as a separate\njurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus,\nthe Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia,\nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\nRomania, Russia, the Slovak Republic,\nSlovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,\nSri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand,\nTrinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine,\nthe U.K. and Venezuela. Substitute payments\nreceived by the Fund for securities lent out\nby the Fund will not be qualified dividend\nincome. A dividend from the Fund will not be\ntreated as qualified dividend income to the\nextent that: (i) the shareholder has not held\nthe shares on which the dividend was paid for\n61 days during the 121-day period that begins\non the date that is 60 days before the date on\nwhich the shares become ex-dividend with\nrespect to such dividend or the Fund fails to\nsatisfy those\n\n91\n\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe securities it holds that paid the\ndividends distributed to the shareholder (or,\nin the case of certain preferred stocks, the\nholding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) the Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by\nthe Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be\ntreated as qualified dividend income only to\nthe extent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by the Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by the Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by the Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from the Underlying Funds and that\nare attributable to dividends paid by U.S.\ncorporations may qualify for the U.S. federal\ndividends received deduction for corporations.\nA 46-day minimum holding period during the\n90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-\ndividend date (or 91-day minimum holding\nperiod during the 180 period beginning 90 days\nprior to ex-dividend date for certain\npreference dividends) during which risk of\nloss may not be diminished is required for the\napplicable shares, at the Fund level, the\nUnderlying Funds' level and shareholder level,\nfor a dividend to be eligible for the\ndividends received deduction. Restrictions may\napply if indebtedness, including a short sale,\nis attributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Fund\nserves to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by its\ntax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in\nthe Fund if shares in the Fund constitute\ndebt-financed property in the hands of the\ntax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by an\nUnderlying Fund from REITs, real estate\nmortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage\npools or other investments may cause the Fund\nto report some or all of its distributions as\n\u201c excess inclusion income. \u201d To Fund\nshareholders, such excess inclusion income\nmay: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI\nfor those shareholders who would otherwise be\ntax-exempt such as individual retirement\naccounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans,\npension plans and certain charitable entities;\n(ii) not be offset by otherwise allowable\ndeductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be\neligible for reduced U.S. withholding for\nnon-U.S. shareholders even from tax treaty\ncountries; and (iv) cause the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund to be subject to tax if\ncertain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust. The Underlying Fund\ntries to avoid investing in REITs that are\nexpected to generate excess inclusion income,\nbut the Fund may not always be successful in\ndoing so. Because information about a REIT\u2019s\ninvestments may be inadequate or inaccurate,\nor because a REIT may change its investment\nprogram, the Fund may not be successful in\navoiding the consequences described above.\nAvoidance of investments in REITs that\ngenerate excess inclusion income may require\nthe Fund to forego otherwise attractive\ninvestment opportunities. Non-U.S.\nInvestments. Under Section 988 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, gains or losses attributable to\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the\ntime an Underlying Fund accrues income or\nreceivables or expenses or other liabilities\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency and the\ntime the Underlying Fund actually collects\nsuch income or pays such liabilities are\ngenerally treated as ordinary income or\nordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses)\nrealized on debt instruments will be treated\nas Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent\nattributable to changes in exchange rates\nbetween the U.S. dollar and the currencies in\nwhich the instruments are denominated.\nSimilarly, gains or losses on non-U.S.\ncurrency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts\nand certain non-U.S. currency options or\nfutures contracts denominated in non-U.S.\ncurrency, to the extent attributable to\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the\nacquisition and disposition dates, are also\ntreated as ordinary income or loss unless an\nUnderlying Fund were to elect otherwise. The\nFund may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes\nwithheld at the source. The Fund, if permitted\nto do so, may elect to \u201c pass through \u201d to its\ninvestors the amount of non-U.S. income taxes\npaid by the Fund provided that the Fund held\nthe security on the dividend settlement date\nand for at least 15 additional days\nimmediately before and/or thereafter, with the\n\n92\n\nresult that each investor with respect to\nshares of the Fund held for a minimum 16-day\nholding period at the time of deemed\ndistribution will (i) include in gross income,\neven though not actually received, the\ninvestor\u2019s pro rata share of the Fund\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct\n(in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only\nfor investors who itemize their deductions on\ntheir personal tax returns) or credit (in\ncalculating U.S. federal income tax) the\ninvestor\u2019s pro rata share of the Fund\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on\ndividends on non-U.S. securities while such\nsecurities are lent out by the Fund are not\neligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through.\nTaxes not \u201c passed through \u201d for tax purposes\nwill not be available to shareholders for\nforeign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person\ninvested in the Fund in a year that the Fund\nelects to \u201c pass through \u201d its non-U.S. taxes\nmay be treated as receiving additional\ndividend income subject to U.S. withholding\ntax. A non-U.S. tax credit may not exceed the\ninvestor\u2019s U.S. federal income tax otherwise\npayable with respect to the investor\u2019s\nnon-U.S. source income. For this purpose,\nshareholders must treat as non-U.S. source\ngross income (i) their proportionate shares of\nnon-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and (ii) the\nportion of any dividend paid by the Fund that\nrepresents income derived from non-U.S.\nsources; the Fund\u2019s gain from the sale of\nsecurities will generally be treated as\nU.S.-source income. Certain limitations will\nbe imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S.\ntax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares\nare loaned pursuant to securities lending\narrangements, you may lose the ability to use\nany non-U.S. tax credits passed through by the\nFund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while\nthe shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\nwith respect to shares of the Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. Passive Foreign Investment Companies.\nIf an Underlying Fund purchases shares in\nPFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on a portion of any \u201c excess\ndistribution \u201d or gain from the disposition of\nsuch shares even if such income is distributed\nas a taxable dividend by the Fund to its\nshareholders. Additional charges in the nature\nof interest may be imposed on the Fund in\nrespect of deferred taxes arising from such\ndistributions or gains. If an Underlying Fund\nwere to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat\nthe PFIC as a \u201c qualified electing fund \u201d\nunder the Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of\nthe foregoing requirements, an Underlying Fund\nmight be required to include in income each\nyear a portion of the ordinary earnings and\nnet capital gains of the qualified electing\nfund, even if not distributed to the\nUnderlying Fund, and such amounts would be\nsubject to the 90% and excise tax distribution\nrequirements described above. In order to make\nthis election, an Underlying Fund would be\nrequired to obtain certain annual information\nfrom the PFICs in which it invests, which may\nbe difficult or impossible to obtain.\nAlternatively, an Underlying Fund may make a\nmark-to-market election that would result in\nthe Underlying Fund being treated as if it had\nsold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end\nof each year. In such case, an Underlying Fund\nwould report any such gains as ordinary income\nand would deduct any such losses as ordinary\nlosses to the extent of previously recognized\ngains. The election must be made separately\nfor each PFIC owned by an Underlying Fund and,\nonce made, would be effective for all\nsubsequent taxable years, unless revoked with\nthe consent of the IRS. By making the\nelection, an Underlying Fund could potentially\nameliorate the adverse tax consequences with\nrespect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC,\nbut in any particular year may be required to\nrecognize income in excess of the\ndistributions it receives from PFICs and its\nproceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. An\nUnderlying Fund may have to distribute this \u201c\nphantom \u201d income and gain to satisfy the 90%\ndistribution requirement and to avoid\nimposition of the 4% excise tax. An Underlying\nFund will make the appropriate tax elections,\nif possible, and take any additional steps\nthat are necessary to mitigate the effects of\nthese rules. Reporting. If a shareholder\nrecognizes a loss with respect to the Fund\u2019s\nshares of $2 million or more for an individual\nshareholder or $10 million or more for a\ncorporate shareholder, the shareholder must\nfile with the IRS a disclosure statement on\nIRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of\nportfolio securities are in many cases\nexempted from this reporting requirement, but\nunder current guidance, shareholders of a RIC\nare not exempted. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer\u2019s treatment of the loss is proper.\nShareholders should consult their tax advisors\nto determine the applicability of these\nregulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances. Other Taxes. Dividends,\ndistributions and redemption proceeds may also\nbe subject to additional state, local and\nnon-U.S. taxes depending on each shareholder\u2019s\nparticular situation. Taxation of Non-U.S.\nShareholders. Dividends paid by the Fund to\nnon-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to\nwithholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced\nrate specified by an applicable income tax\ntreaty to the extent derived from investment\nincome and short-term capital gains. Dividends\npaid by the Fund from net tax-exempt income or\nlong-term capital gains are generally not\nsubject to such withholding tax. In order to\nobtain a reduced rate of withholding, a\nnon-U.S.\n\n93\n\nshareholder will be required to provide an IRS\nForm W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying\nits entitlement to benefits under a treaty.\nThe withholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor business within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Properly-reported\ndividends are generally exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax where they (i) are\npaid in respect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net\ninterest income \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S.\nsource interest income, other than certain\ncontingent interest and interest from\nobligations of a corporation or partnership in\nwhich the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder\nor partner, reduced by expenses that are\nallocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term\ncapital gains \u201d (generally, the excess of the\nFund\u2019s net short-term capital gain over the\nFund\u2019s long-term capital loss for such taxable\nyear). However, depending on its\ncircumstances, the Fund may report all, some\nor none of its potentially eligible dividends\nas such qualified net interest income or as\nqualified short-term capital gains and/or\ntreat such dividends, in whole or in part, as\nineligible for this exemption from\nwithholding. In order to qualify for this\nexemption from withholding, a non-U.S.\nshareholder will need to comply with\napplicable certification requirements relating\nto its non-U.S. status (including, in general,\nfurnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of\nshares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if the Fund\nreports the payment as qualified net interest\nincome or qualified short-term capital gain.\nNon-U.S. shareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts. Special\nrules may apply to a foreign shareholder\nreceiving a Fund distribution if at least 50%\nof the Fund's assets consist of interests in\nU.S. real property interests, including\ncertain REITs and U.S. real property holding\ncorporations (as defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund\ndistributions that are attributable to gain\nfrom the disposition of a U.S. real property\ninterest will be taxable as ordinary dividends\nand subject to withholding at a 30% or lower\ntreaty rate if the foreign shareholder held no\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time\nduring the one-year period ending on the date\nof the distribution. If the foreign\nshareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's\nshares, the distribution would be treated as\nincome effectively connected with a trade or\nbusiness within the U.S. and the foreign\nshareholder would be subject to withholding\ntax at a rate of 21% and would generally be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences would generally\napply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the\nsale of Fund shares unless the Fund is\ndomestically controlled (meaning that more\nthan 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is\nheld by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign\nshareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of sale. Finally, a\ndomestically controlled Fund may be required\nto recognize a portion of its gain on the in-\nkind distribution of certain U.S. real\nproperty interests. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund. The rules\nlaid out in the previous paragraph, other than\nthe withholding rules, will apply\nnotwithstanding the Fund\u2019s participation in a\nwash sale transaction or its payment of a\nsubstitute dividend. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in a Fund. Separately, a\n30% withholding tax is currently imposed on\nU.S.-source dividends, interest and other\nincome items paid to: (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S. investment\nfunds, unless they agree to collect and\ndisclose to the IRS information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S. account\nholders; and (ii) certain other foreign\nentities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address,\n\n94\n\nand taxpayer identification number of each\nsubstantial U.S. owner or provide\ncertifications of no substantial U.S.\nownership unless certain exceptions apply.\nShares of the Fund held by a non-U.S.\nshareholder at death will be considered\nsituated within the U.S. and subject to the\nU.S. estate tax. The foregoing discussion is a\nsummary of certain material U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations only and is not\nintended as a substitute for careful tax\nplanning. Purchasers of shares should consult\ntheir own tax advisors as to the tax\nconsequences of investing in such shares,\nincluding consequences under state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the foregoing\ndiscussion is based on applicable provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code, regulations,\njudicial authority and administrative\ninterpretations in effect on the date of this\nSAI. Changes in applicable authority could\nmaterially affect the conclusions discussed\nabove, and such changes often occur.

Policy/Document\nRequirements and Statements The Boards of\nTrustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d ) of open-\nend funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d ) advised by\nBlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors,\nLLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ), have the responsibility\nfor the oversight of voting proxies relating\nto portfolio securities of the Funds, and have\ndetermined that it is in the best interests of\nthe Funds and their shareholders to delegate\nthe responsibility to vote proxies to\nBlackRock, subject to the principles outlined\nin this Policy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s\nauthority to manage, acquire and dispose of\naccount assets, all as contemplated by the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment management\nagreements.

We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by- laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third- party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals. For shareholder\nmeetings where a vote might be high profile or\nof significant interest to clients, we may\npublish a vote bulletin after the meeting,\ndisclosing and explaining our vote on key\nproposals. We also publish a quarterly list of\nall companies with which we engaged and the\nkey topics addressed in the engagement\nmeeting. In this way, we help inform our\nclients about the work we do on their behalf\nin promoting the governance and business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\n11 The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.\n\nA-15\n\nAppendix B \u2013 Description of Fixed-Income\nRatings A rating is generally assigned to a\nfixed-income security at the time of issuance\nby a credit rating agency designated as a\nNRSRO by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time\nto time revise such ratings, they undertake no\nobligation to do so, and the ratings given to\nsecurities at issuance do not necessarily\nrepresent ratings which would be given to\nthese securities on a particular subsequent\ndate. NRSROs may rate specific investments (\ne.g. , bonds), issuers ( e.g. , corporations,\ngovernments and financial institutions) and/or\nprograms ( e.g. , commercial paper programs).\nHowever, certain types of investments may not\nbe rated by NRSROs, such as certain\ngovernment/sovereign obligations, US agency\nsecurities, commercial paper, time deposits at\nfinancial institutions, and derivative\ninstruments such as credit default swaps. For\nthese types of investments, as well as US\nTreasury securities (some of which are not\nrated), where a NRSRO has not rated the\nspecific investment but has rated the\ninvestment\u2019s issuer, program, financial\ninstitution or underlying reference asset, BFA\nmay consider the investment to have the same\nNRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial\ninstitution or underlying reference asset, as\napplicable. In the case of municipal\nsecurities, where one NRSRO provides multiple\nratings for the same security ( e.g. , \u201c\nunderlying, \u201d \u201c insured \u201d and/or \u201c enhanced \u201d\nratings), BFA may consider the security to\nhave the highest of the multiple ratings. New\nissue securities (regardless of type) may not\nbe rated by a NRSRO at the time of their\ninitial offering. Preliminary prospectuses or\nterm sheets for new issue securities may\ninclude an expected rating for the security\n(as determined by the underwriter and/or\nissuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of\nthe security. If applicable, when deciding\nwhether to purchase a new issue security that\nhas not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may\nattribute an expected rating to the security\nbased on: (i) the expected rating of the\nsecurity set forth in the preliminary\nprospectus or term sheet for the security;\n(ii) the NRSRO\u2019s rating for the issuer of the\nsecurity set forth in the preliminary\nprospectus or term sheet for the security; or\n(iii) with respect to asset-backed securities,\nthe rating of a prior issuance having a\nsimilar structure or the same sponsor. Where\nthe investment objective of the Fund is to\ntrack the performance of an index that\nincludes credit ratings eligibility criteria\nas part of its index methodology, the Fund may\npurchase any security within the index, such\nsecurity having been determined by the index\nprovider as meeting its credit ratings\neligibility criteria. The credit ratings\npractices of an index provider may differ from\nBlackRock\u2019s practices, as described above.\nFurther, the Fund may invest, directly or\nindirectly, in securities that are not rated\nby a rating agency or securities with a credit\nrating that differs from the credit rating\nspecified in its index methodology in various\ncircumstances, including where a security is\ndowngraded but not yet removed from an index,\nfollowing the removal of a security from an\nindex prior to its sale by the Fund or as a\nresult of a corporate action or restructuring\naffecting an issuer of a security held by the\nFund. Fixed-income securities which are\nunrated may expose the investor to risks with\nrespect to capacity to pay interest or repay\nprincipal which are similar to the risks of\nlower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of\nthese securities is dependent on the\ninvestment adviser\u2019s judgment, analysis and\nexperience in the evaluation of such\nsecurities. Investors should note that the\nassignment of a rating to a security by an\nNRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent\ndevelopments on the issuer\u2019s ability to make\ninterest and principal payments or on the\nlikelihood of default. Securities deemed to be\nhigh yield are rated below Baa3 by Moody\u2019s and\nbelow BBB- by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch.\nThe descriptions below relate to general long-\nterm and short-term obligations of an issuer.\nMoody\u2019s Ratings Long-Term Obligations Aaa:\nObligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the\nhighest quality, subject to the lowest level\nof credit risk. Aa: Obligations rated Aa are\njudged to be of high quality and are subject\nto very low credit risk. A: Obligations rated\nA are judged to be upper-medium grade and are\nsubject to low credit risk. Baa: Obligations\nrated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and\nsubject to moderate credit risk and as such\nmay possess certain speculative\ncharacteristics.\n\nB-1\n\nBa: Obligations rated Ba are judged to be\nspeculative and are subject to substantial\ncredit risk. B: Obligations rated B are\nconsidered speculative and are subject to high\ncredit risk. Caa: Obligations rated Caa are\njudged to be speculative, of poor standing and\nare subject to very high credit risk. Ca:\nObligations rated Ca are highly speculative\nand are likely in, or very near, default, with\nsome prospect of recovery of principal and\ninterest. C: Obligations rated C are the\nlowest rated and are typically in default,\nwith little prospect for recovery of principal\nor interest. Note: Moody's appends numerical\nmodifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating\nclassification from Aa through Caa. The\nmodifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks\nin the higher end of its generic rating\ncategory; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range\nranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a\nranking in the lower end of that generic\nrating category. Absence of Rating: Where no\nrating has been assigned or where a rating has\nbeen withdrawn, it may be for reasons\nunrelated to the creditworthiness of the\nissue. Should no rating be assigned, the\nreason may be one of the following: 1. An\napplication was not received or accepted. 2.\nThe issue or issuer belongs to a group of\nsecurities or entities that are not rated as a\nmatter of policy. 3. There is a lack of\nessential data pertaining to the issue or\nissuer. 4. The issue was privately placed, in\nwhich case the rating is not published in\nMoody\u2019s publications. Withdrawal may occur if\nnew and material circumstances arise, the\neffects of which preclude satisfactory\nanalysis; if there is no longer available\nreasonable up-to-date data to permit a\njudgment to be formed; if a bond is called for\nredemption; or for other reasons. Short-Term\nObligations Moody\u2019s short-term debt ratings\nare opinions of the ability of issuers to\nhonor short-term financial obligations,\ngenerally with an original maturity not\nexceeding thirteen months. Moody's employs the\nfollowing designations to indicate the\nrelative repayment ability of rated issuers:\nP-1: Issuers (or supporting institutions)\nrated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay\nshort-term debt obligations. P-2: Issuers (or\nsupporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a\nstrong ability to repay short-term debt\nobligations. P-3: Issuers (or supporting\ninstitutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable\nability to repay short-term obligations. NP:\nIssuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not\nPrime do not fall within any of the Prime\nrating categories. US Municipal Short-Term\nDebt Obligations There are three rating\ncategories for short-term municipal\nobligations that are considered investment-\ngrade and are designated as Municipal\nInvestment Grade (MIG). In addition, those\nshort-term obligations that are of speculative\nquality are designated SG, or speculative\ngrade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of\nthe obligation. MIG 1: This designation\ndenotes superior credit quality. Excellent\nprotection is afforded by established cash\nflows, highly reliable liquidity support, or\ndemonstrated broad-based access to the market\nfor refinancing. MIG 2: This designation\ndenotes strong credit quality. Margins of\nprotection are ample, although not as large as\nin the preceding group. MIG 3: This\ndesignation denotes acceptable credit quality.\nLiquidity and cash-flow protection may be\nnarrow, and market access for refinancing is\nlikely to be less well-established.\n\nB-2\n\nSG: This designation denotes speculative-grade\ncredit quality. Debt instruments in this\ncategory may lack sufficient margins of\nprotection. S&P Global Ratings Long-Term\nObligations AAA: An obligation rated AAA has\nthe highest rating assigned by S&P Global\nRatings. The obligor\u2019s capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation is\nextremely strong. AA: An obligation rated AA\ndiffers from the highest-rated obligations\nonly to a small degree. The obligor\u2019s capacity\nto meet its financial commitment is very\nstrong. A: An obligation rated A is somewhat\nmore susceptible to the adverse effects of\nchanges in circumstances and economic\nconditions than obligations in higher-rated\ncategories. However, the obligor\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its financial commitment on the\nobligation is still strong. BBB: An obligation\nrated BBB exhibits adequate protection\nparameters. However, adverse economic\nconditions or changing circumstances are more\nlikely to lead to a weakened capacity of the\nobligor to meet its financial commitment on\nthe obligation. BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:\nObligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are\nregarded as having significant speculative\ncharacteristics. BB indicates the least degree\nof speculation and C the highest. While such\nobligations will likely have some quality and\nprotective characteristics, these may be\noutweighed by large uncertainties or major\nexposures to adverse conditions. BB: An\nobligation rated BB is less vulnerable to\nnonpayment than other speculative issues.\nHowever, it faces major ongoing uncertainties\nor exposure to adverse business, financial, or\neconomic conditions which could lead to the\nobligor\u2019s inadequate capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation. B: An\nobligation rated B is more vulnerable to\nnonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the\nobligor currently has the capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation.\nAdverse business, financial, or economic\nconditions will likely impair the obligor\u2019s\ncapacity or willingness to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. CCC: An\nobligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable\nto nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable\nbusiness, financial, and economic conditions\nfor the obligor to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. In the event of\nadverse business, financial, or economic\nconditions, the obligor is not likely to have\nthe capacity to meet its financial commitment\non the obligation. CC: An obligation rated CC\nis currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.\nThe CC rating is used when a default has not\nyet occurred, but S&P Global Ratings expects\ndefault to be a virtual certainty, regardless\nof the anticipated time to default. C: An\nobligation rated C is currently highly\nvulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation\nis expected to have lower relative seniority\nor lower ultimate recovery compared to\nobligations that are rated higher. D: An\nobligation rated D is in default or in breach\nof an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital\ninstruments, the D rating category is used\nwhen payments on an obligation are not made on\nthe date due, unless S&P Global Ratings\nbelieves that such payments will be made\nwithin five business days in the absence of a\nstated grace period or within the earlier of\nthe stated grace period or 30 calendar days.\nThe D rating also will be used upon the filing\nof a bankruptcy petition or the taking of\nsimilar action and where default on an\nobligation is a virtual certainty, for example\ndue to automatic stay provisions. An\nobligation's rating is lowered to D if it is\nsubject to a distressed exchange offer. NR: NR\nindicates no rating has been requested, or\nthat there is insufficient information on\nwhich to base a rating, or that S&P Global\nRatings does not rate a particular obligation\nas a matter of policy. Note: The ratings from\nAA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a\nplus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative\nstanding within the major rating categories.\nShort-Term Obligations\n\nB-3\n\nA-1: A short-term obligation rated A-1 is\nrated in the highest category by S&P Global\nRatings. The obligor's capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation is\nstrong. Within this category, certain\nobligations are designated with a plus sign\n(+). This indicates that the obligor's\ncapacity to meet its financial commitment on\nthese obligations is extremely strong. A-2: A\nshort-term obligation rated A-2 is somewhat\nmore susceptible to the adverse effects of\nchanges in circumstances and economic\nconditions than obligations in higher rating\ncategories. However, the obligor's capacity to\nmeet its financial commitment on the\nobligation is satisfactory. A-3: A short-term\nobligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate\nprotection parameters. However, adverse\neconomic conditions or changing circumstances\nare more likely to lead to a weakened capacity\nof the obligor to meet its financial\ncommitment on the obligation. B: A short-term\nobligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable\nand has significant speculative\ncharacteristics. The obligor currently has the\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments;\nhowever, it faces major ongoing uncertainties\nwhich could lead to the obligor's inadequate\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments. C:\nA short-term obligation rated C is currently\nvulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon\nfavorable business, financial, and economic\nconditions for the obligor to meet its\nfinancial commitment on the obligation. D: A\nshort-term obligation rated D is in default or\nin breach of an imputed promise. For non-\nhybrid capital instruments, the D rating\ncategory is used when payments on an\nobligation are not made on the date due,\nunless S&P Global Ratings believes that such\npayments will be made within any stated grace\nperiod. However, any stated grace period\nlonger than five business days will be treated\nas five business days. The D rating also will\nbe used upon the filing of a bankruptcy\npetition or the taking of a similar action and\nwhere default on an obligation is a virtual\ncertainty, for example due to automatic stay\nprovisions. An obligation's rating is lowered\nto D if it is subject to a distressed exchange\noffer. Municipal Short-Term Obligations An S&P\nU.S. municipal note rating reflects S&P Global\nRatings opinion about the liquidity factors\nand market access risks unique to the notes.\nNotes due in three years or less will likely\nreceive a note rating. Notes with an original\nmaturity of more than three years will most\nlikely receive a long-term debt rating. SP-1:\nStrong capacity to pay principal and interest.\nAn issue determined to possess a very strong\ncapacity to pay debt service is given a plus\n(+) designation. SP-2: Satisfactory capacity\nto pay principal and interest, with some\nvulnerability to adverse financial and\neconomic changes over the term of the notes.\nSP-3: Speculative capacity to pay principal\nand interest. Fitch Ratings Long-Term\nObligations AAA: Highest credit quality. AAA\nratings denote the lowest expectation of\ncredit risk. They are assigned only in cases\nof exceptionally strong capacity for payment\nof financial commitments. This capacity is\nhighly unlikely to be adversely affected by\nforeseeable events. AA: Very high credit\nquality. AA ratings denote expectations of\nvery low credit risk. They indicate very\nstrong capacity for payment of financial\ncommitments. This capacity is not\nsignificantly vulnerable to foreseeable\nevents. A: High credit quality. A ratings\ndenote expectations of low credit risk. The\ncapacity for payment of financial commitments\nis considered strong. This capacity may,\nnevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse\nbusiness or economic conditions than is the\ncase for higher ratings. BBB: Good credit\nquality. BBB ratings indicate that\nexpectations of credit risk are currently low.\nThe capacity for payment of financial\ncommitments is considered adequate but adverse\nbusiness or economic conditions are more\nlikely to impair this capacity.\n\nB-4\n\nBB: Speculative. BB ratings indicate an\nelevated vulnerability to credit risk,\nparticularly in the event of adverse changes\nin business or economic conditions over time;\nhowever, business or financial alternatives\nmay be available to allow financial\ncommitments to be met. B: Highly speculative.\nB ratings indicate that material credit risk\nis present. CCC: Substantial credit risk. CCC\nratings indicate that substantial credit risk\nis present. CC: Very high levels of credit\nrisk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of\ncredit risk. C: Exceptionally high levels of\ncredit risk. C indicates exceptionally high\nlevels of credit risk. Defaulted obligations\ntypically are not assigned RD or D ratings,\nbut are instead rated in the B to C rating\ncategories, depending upon their recovery\nprospects and other relevant characteristics.\nThis approach better aligns obligations that\nhave comparable overall expected loss but\nvarying vulnerability to default and loss.\nNote: The modifiers \u201c + \u201d or \u201c - \u201d may be\nappended to a rating to denote relative status\nwithin major rating categories. Such suffixes\nare not added to the AAA obligation rating\ncategory, or to corporate finance obligation\nratings in the categories below CCC. The\nsubscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to\ndenote embedded market risk which is beyond\nthe scope of the rating. The designation is\nintended to make clear that the rating solely\naddresses the counterparty risk of the issuing\nbank. It is not meant to indicate any\nlimitation in the analysis of the counterparty\nrisk, which in all other respects follows\npublished Fitch criteria for analyzing the\nissuing financial institution. Fitch does not\nrate these instruments where the principal is\nto any degree subject to market risk. Short-\nTerm Obligations (Corporate and Public\nFinance) A short-term issuer or obligation\nrating is based in all cases on the short-term\nvulnerability to default of the rated entity\nor security stream and relates to the capacity\nto meet financial obligations in accordance\nwith the documentation governing the relevant\nobligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to\nobligations whose initial maturity is viewed\nas \u201c short-term \u201d based on market convention.\nTypically, this means up to 13 months for\ncorporate, sovereign, and structured\nobligations, and up to 36 months for\nobligations in U.S. public finance markets.\nF1: Highest short-term credit quality.\nIndicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for\ntimely payment of financial commitments; may\nhave an added \u201c + \u201d to denote any\nexceptionally strong credit feature. F2: Good\nshort-term credit quality. Good intrinsic\ncapacity for timely payment of financial\ncommitments. F3: Fair short-term credit\nquality. The intrinsic capacity for timely\npayment of financial commitments is adequate.\nB: Speculative short-term credit quality.\nMinimal capacity for timely payment of\nfinancial commitments, plus heightened\nvulnerability to near term adverse changes in\nfinancial and economic conditions. C: High\nshort-term default risk. Default is a real\npossibility. RD: Restricted default. Indicates\nan entity that has defaulted on one or more of\nits financial commitments, although it\ncontinues to meet other financial obligations.\nTypically applicable to entity ratings only.\nD: Default. Indicates a broad-based default\nevent for an entity, or the default of a\nshort-term obligation. IS-SAI-BYLD-1024\n\nB-5\n"
