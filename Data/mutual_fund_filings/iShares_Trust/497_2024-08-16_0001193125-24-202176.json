As a result, the last\nday of trading in the Fund on NYSE Arca, Inc.\n(\u0093NYSE Arca\u0094) will be October 15, 2024. NYSE\nArca will suspend trading in the Fund before\nthe open of trading on October 16, 2024, and\nshares of the Fund will no longer be available\nfor new investments as of this date. Proceeds\nof the liquidation are currently scheduled to\nbe sent to shareholders on October 18, 2024.\nThe Fund\u0092s final net asset value, as\ncalculated on\nOctober 15, 2024, will include any costs\nassociated with the liquidation expected to be\nborne by the Fund.\n\nBecause shares of the Fund will not be traded\non\nNYSE Arca during the period between October\n16, 2024 and October 18, 2024, we cannot\nassure you that there will be a trading market\nfor your shares. Further, during this period,\nthe Fund will be in the process of closing\ndown and\nliquidating its portfolio, which may result in\nthe Fund not being able to track its\nUnderlying Index (by October 16, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index value will be represented\nalmost entirely by cash as no securities will\nremain in the Underlying\nIndex). After October 15, 2024, shareholders\nthat remain invested in the Fund will receive\nthe entire amount of their pro rata share of\nthe liquidation proceeds on or about October\n18, 2024, subject to their brokerage firm\u0092s\nprocesses.\n\nShareholders may sell their holdings of the\nFund prior to October 16, 2024 and may incur\nthe usual and customary brokerage commissions\nassociated\nwith the sale of Fund shares. If you still\nhold shares of the Fund on October 18, 2024,\nthe Fund will automatically redeem your shares\nfor cash based on the net asset value as of\nthe close of business on October 15, 2024,\nwhich will\ninclude any dividends or distributions\ncalculated as of that date.\n\nIf you are subject to federal income tax, the\nliquidation of the Fund will result in one or\nmore\ntaxable events for you. A sale or exchange of\nFund shares prior to the liquidation will\ngenerally give rise to a capital gain or loss\nto you for federal income tax purposes. In\nconnection with the liquidation, the Fund may\ndeclare tax exempt or\ntaxable distributions of its investment income\nand/or taxable distributions of its net\ncapital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to\nyou should generally be treated as received by\nyou in exchange for your shares and will\ntherefore generally give\nrise to a capital gain or loss depending on\nyour tax basis. Please refer to the \u0093Taxes\u0094\n\ndisclosure beginning on page 69 of the SAI and\nconsult your own tax advisor about the\npotential tax consequences of the Fund\u0092s\nliquidation, including any state, local,\nforeign or other tax\nconsequences.\n\nIf you have any questions, please call\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\n\niShares is a registered trademark of BlackRock\nFund Advisors or its affiliates.\n\nIS-A-IBIA-0824\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT\n\nFOR FUTURE REFERENCE\n"
