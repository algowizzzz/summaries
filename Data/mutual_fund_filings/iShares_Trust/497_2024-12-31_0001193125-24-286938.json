  "text": "iShares \u00ae iShares Trust Supplement dated\nDecember 31, 2024 to the currently effective\nSummary Prospectus, Prospectus and Statement\nof Additional Information (the \u201cSAI\u201d) for the\niShares iBonds Oct 2025 Term TIPS ETF, iShares\niBonds Oct 2026 Term TIPS ETF, iShares iBonds\nOct 2027 Term TIPS ETF, iShares iBonds Oct\n2028 Term TIPS ETF, iShares iBonds Oct 2029\nTerm TIPS ETF, iShares iBonds Oct 2030 Term\nTIPS ETF, iShares iBonds Oct 2031 Term TIPS\nETF, iShares iBonds Oct 2032 Term TIPS ETF,\niShares iBonds Oct 2033 Term TIPS ET, and\niShares iBonds Oct 2034 Term TIPS ETF (each, a\n\u201cFund\u201d and collectively, the \u201cFunds\u201d) The\nfollowing changes for the Funds will be\neffective on or around January 31, 2025. In\neach Fund\u2019s Summary Prospectus and Prospectus,\nthe section entitled \u201cPrincipal Investment\nStrategies\u201d is modified by replacing the\nfourth through the final paragraph with the\nfollowing: The Underlying Index is rebalanced\non the last calendar day of each month. New\nissues must settle on or before the following\ncalendar month end rebalancing date in order\nto qualify for inclusion for such following\nmonth (e.g., an issue must settle on or before\nAugust 31 in order to be included in the index\non July 31). The securities in the Underlying\nIndex are updated on the last calendar day of\neach month. Cash flows from bond payments that\nare received during the month are retained in\nthe Underlying Index until the end of the\nmonth and then are removed as part of the\nrebalancing. When cash or a security is\nremoved as part of the rebalancing, it\neffectively increases the weighting of the\nremaining securities in the Underlying Index,\nand the Fund is required to invest in the\nremaining securities to bring its holdings in\nline with the Underlying Index. Cash does not\nearn any reinvestment income while it is held\nin the Underlying Index. The Fund will invest\nat least 80% of its assets in the component\nsecurities of the Underlying Index, and the\nFund will invest at least 90% of its assets in\nU.S. Treasury securities that BFA believes\nwill help the Fund track the Underlying Index,\nin each case except as described below. The\nFund will invest no more than 10% of its\nassets in futures, options and swaps contracts\nthat BFA believes will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part of that\nposition for the purposes of calculating the\npercentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund. In the\nlast six months of operation, as the bonds\nheld by the Fund mature, the proceeds will\ntypically be reinvested by the Fund in\ninvestments already in the Underlying Index\nbut may also be invested in other cash and\ncash equivalents as determined by BFA. To the\nextent that the Fund invests in money market\nor similar funds, it will incur the fees and\nexpenses of such funds.\n\nBy October 15 of the relevant year, the Fund\nis expected to consist almost entirely of\ncash. On or around this date, the Fund will\nwind up and terminate. After appropriate\nprovision is made for any Fund liabilities,\nits net assets will be distributed to then-\ncurrent shareholders pursuant to a plan of\nliquidation. The Fund\u2019s termination was\napproved by a majority of the Trust\u2019s Board of\nTrustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and does not require\nadditional approval by Fund shareholders. The\nBoard may extend the termination date if a\nmajority of the Board determines the extension\nto be in the best interest of the Fund. BFA\nuses an indexing approach to try to achieve\nthe Fund\u2019s investment objective. The Fund does\nnot try to \u201cbeat\u201d the index it tracks and does\nnot seek temporary defensive positions when\nmarkets decline or appear overvalued. Indexing\nmay eliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after\u2011tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund.\n\u201cRepresentative sampling\u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market value and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return variability,\nduration (i.e., a security\u2019s price sensitivity\nto a change in interest rates), maturity or\ncredit ratings and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund may lend securities representing up\nto one\u2011third of the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets (including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is owned,\nmaintained and administered by ICE Data\nIndices, LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d or \u201cIDI\u201d),\nwhich is independent of the Fund and BFA. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and publishes information\nregarding the market value of the Underlying\nIndex. In the section entitled \u201cSummary of\nPrincipal Risks\u201d of each Fund\u2019s Summary\nProspectus, the risk titled \u201cDeclining Yield\nRisk\u201d is deleted in its entirety and replaced\nwith the following: Declining Yield\nRisk.During the six months prior to the Fund\u2019s\nplanned termination date, the Fund\u2019s yield may\nmove toward prevailing money market rates and\nmay be lower than the yields of the bonds\npreviously held by the Fund and lower than\nprevailing yields for bonds in the market. In\nthe section entitled \u201cSummary of Principal\nRisks\u201d of each Fund\u2019s Summary Prospectus and\nthe section entitled \u201cAdditional Information\nAbout the Fund\u2019s Risks\u201d of each Fund\u2019s\nProspectus, the last sentence of the risk\ntitled \u201cIncome Risk\u201d is deleted in its\nentirety.\n\nThe fourth paragraph of the section entitled\n\u201cMore Information About the Fund\u201d of each\nFund\u2019s Prospectus is deleted in its entirety.\n\nIn the section entitled \u201cA Further Discussion\nof Principal Risks\u201d of each Fund\u2019s Prospectus,\nthe risk titled \u201cDeclining Yield Risk\u201d is\ndeleted in its entirety and replaced with the\nfollowing:\n                                              \n  Declining Yield Risk.                       \n                                              \nDuring the six months prior to the Fund\u2019s\nplanned termination date, the Fund\u2019s yield may\nmove toward prevailing money market rates, and\nmay be lower than the yields of the bonds\npreviously held by the Fund and lower than\nprevailing yields for bonds in the market.\n\nIn the section entitled \u201cA Further Discussion\nof Principal Risks\u201d of each Fund\u2019s Prospectus,\nthe risk titled \u201cInflation-Indexed Bonds Risk\u201d\nis modified by the following sentence added to\nthe end of the second paragraph:\n\nDue to their inflation adjustment feature,\ninflation-indexed bonds typically have lower\nnominal yields than conventional fixed-rate\nbonds.\n\nExcept for the iShares iBonds Oct 2034 Term\nTIPS ETF, in each Fund\u2019s SAI, the fourth and\nfifth paragraphs of the section entitled\n\u201cInvestment Strategies and Risks\u201d are deleted\nin their entirety and replaced with the\nfollowing:\n\nEach Fund will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of each\nUnderlying Index, and each Fund will invest at\nleast 90% of its assets in U.S. Treasury\nsecurities that BFA believes will help each\nFund track its Underlying Index, in each case\nexcept as described below.
