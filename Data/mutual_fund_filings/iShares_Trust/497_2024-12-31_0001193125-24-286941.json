  "text": "iShares \u00ae iShares Trust Supplement dated\nDecember 31, 2024 to the currently effective\nSummary Prospectus, Prospectus and Statement\nof Additional Information (the \u201cSAI\u201d) for the\niShares iBonds Dec 2025 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2026 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2027 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2028 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2029 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2030 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2031 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2032 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2033 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2034 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2044 Term Treasury ETF, and\niShares iBonds Dec 2054 Term Treasury ETF\n(each, a \u201cFund\u201d and collectively, the \u201cFunds\u201d)\nThe following changes for the Funds will be\neffective on or around January 31, 2025. In\neach Fund\u2019s Summary Prospectus and Prospectus,\nthe section entitled \u201cPrincipal Investment\nStrategies,\u201d is modified by replacing the\nthird through the final paragraph with the\nfollowing: The Underlying Index is market\nvalue-weighted based on amounts outstanding\nreduced by amounts held by the Federal Reserve\nSystem Open Market Account (\u201cSOMA\u201d) times\nprice plus accrued interest. Accrued interest\nis calculated assuming next\u2011day settlement.\nThe Underlying Index is rebalanced on the last\ncalendar day of the month, based on\ninformation available up to and including the\nthird business day before the last business\nday of the month. New issues must settle on or\nbefore the following calendar month end\nrebalancing date in order to qualify for\ninclusion for such following month (e.g., an\nissue must settle on or before November 30 in\norder to be included in the index on October\n31). The securities in the Underlying Index\nare updated on the last calendar day of each\nmonth. Cash flows from bond payments that are\nreceived during the month are retained in the\nUnderlying Index until the end of the month\nand then are removed as part of the\nrebalancing. When cash or a security is\nremoved as part of the rebalancing, it\neffectively increases the weighting of the\nremaining securities in the Underlying Index,\nand the Fund is required to invest in the\nremaining securities to bring its holdings in\nline with the Underlying Index. Cash does not\nearn any reinvestment income while it is held\nin the Underlying Index The Fund will invest\nat least 80% of its assets in the component\nsecurities of the Underlying Index, and the\nFund will invest at least 90% of its assets in\nU.S. Treasury securities that BFA believes\nwill help the Fund track the Underlying Index,\nin each case except as described below. The\nFund will invest no more than 10% of its\nassets in futures, options and swaps contracts\nthat BFA believes will help the Fund track the\nUnderlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a derivative\nposition will be treated as part of that\nposition for the purposes of calculating the\npercentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index.\n\nThe Fund seeks to track the investment results\nof the Underlying Index before fees and\nexpenses of the Fund. In the last six months\nof operation, as the bonds held by the Fund\nmature, the proceeds will typically be\nreinvested by the Fund in investments already\nin the Underlying Index but may also be\ninvested in other cash and cash equivalents as\ndetermined by BFA. To the extent that the Fund\ninvests in money market or similar funds, it\nwill incur the fees and expenses of such\nfunds. By December 15 of the relevant year,\nthe Fund is expected to consist almost\nentirely of cash. On or around this date, the\nFund will wind up and terminate. After\nappropriate provision is made for any Fund\nliabilities, its net assets will be\ndistributed to then-current shareholders\npursuant to a plan of liquidation. The Fund\u2019s\ntermination was approved by a majority of the\nTrust\u2019s Board of Trustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and\ndoes not require additional approval by Fund\nshareholders. The Board may extend the\ntermination date if a majority of the Board\ndetermines the extension to be in the best\ninterest of the Fund. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objective. The Fund does not try to\n\u201cbeat\u201d the index it tracks and does not seek\ntemporary defensive positions when markets\ndecline or appear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the Fund will\nsubstantially outperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the risks of\nactive management, such as poor security\nselection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after\u2011tax performance by\naiming to keep portfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed investment\ncompanies. BFA uses a representative sampling\nindexing strategy to manage the Fund.\n\u201cRepresentative sampling\u201d is an indexing\nstrategy that involves investing in a\nrepresentative sample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment profile similar\nto that of an applicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected to have, in\nthe aggregate, investment characteristics\n(based on factors such as market value and\nindustry weightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return variability,\nduration (i.e., a security\u2019s price sensitivity\nto a change in interest rates), maturity or\ncredit ratings and yield) and liquidity\nmeasures similar to those of an applicable\nunderlying index. The Fund may or may not hold\nall of the securities in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund may lend securities representing up\nto one\u2011third of the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets (including the value of any collateral\nreceived). The Underlying Index is owned,\nmaintained and administered by ICE Data\nIndices, LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d or \u201cIDI\u201d),\nwhich is independent of the Fund and BFA. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index and publishes information\nregarding the market value of the Underlying\nIndex. In the section entitled \u201cSummary of\nPrincipal Risks\u201d of each Fund\u2019s Summary\nProspectus, the risk titled \u201cDeclining Yield\nRisk\u201d is deleted in its entirety and replaced\nwith the following: Declining Yield\nRisk.During the six months prior to the Fund\u2019s\nplanned termination date, the Fund\u2019s yield may\nmove toward prevailing money market rates\n\nand may be lower than the yields of the bonds\npreviously held by the Fund and lower than\nprevailing yields for bonds in the market. In\nthe section entitled \u201cSummary of Principal\nRisks\u201d of each Fund\u2019s Summary Prospectus and\nthe section entitled \u201cAdditional Information\nAbout the Fund\u2019s Risks\u201d of each Fund\u2019s\nProspectus, the last sentence of the risk\ntitled \u201cIncome Risk\u201d is deleted in its\nentirety.\n\nThe fourth paragraph of the section entitled\n\u201cMore Information About the Fund\u201d of each\nFund\u2019s Prospectus is deleted in its entirety.\n\nIn the section entitled \u201cA Further Discussion\nof Principal Risks\u201d of each Fund\u2019s Prospectus,\nthe risk titled \u201cDeclining Yield Risk\u201d is\ndeleted in its entirety and replaced with the\nfollowing:\n                                              \n  Declining Yield Risk.                       \n                                              \nDuring the six months prior to the Fund\u2019s\nplanned termination date, the Fund\u2019s yield may\nmove toward prevailing money market rates, and\nmay be lower than the yields of the bonds\npreviously held by the Fund and lower than\nprevailing yields for bonds in the market.\n\nExcept for the iShares iBonds Dec 2034 Term\nTreasury ETF, iShares iBonds Dec 2044 Term\nTreasury ETF and iShares iBonds Dec 2054 Term\nTreasury ETF, in each Fund\u2019s SAI, the eighth\nand ninth paragraphs of the section entitled\n\u201cInvestment Strategies and Risks\u201d are deleted\nin their entirety and replaced with the\nfollowing:\n\nThe iShares iBonds Dec 2025 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2026 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2027 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2028 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2029 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2030 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2031 Term Treasury ETF,\niShares iBonds Dec 2032 Term Treasury ETF and\niShares iBonds Dec 2033 Term Treasury ETF will\ninvest at least 80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of each Underlying Index,\nand each Fund will invest at least 90% of its\nassets in U.S. Treasury securities that BFA\nbelieves will help each Fund track its\nUnderlying Index, in each case except as\ndescribed below. Each Fund will invest no more\nthan 10% of its assets in futures, options and\nswaps contracts that BFA believes will help\neach Fund track its Underlying Index. Cash and\ncash equivalent investments associated with a\nderivative position will be treated as part of\nthat position for the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments included in the\nUnderlying Index. Each Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of its Underlying Index\nbefore fees and expenses of the Fund.\n\nIn the last six months of operation, as the\nbonds held by each Fund mature, the proceeds\nwill typically be reinvested by each Fund in\ninvestments already in its Underlying Index\nbut may also be invested in other cash and\ncash equivalents as determined by BFA. To the\nextent that each Fund invests in money market\nor similar funds, it will incur the fees and\nexpenses of such funds. By December\u00a015 of the\nrelevant year, each Fund is expected to\nconsist almost entirely of cash. On or around\nthis date, each Fund will wind up and\nterminate. After appropriate provision is made\nfor any Fund liabilities, each Fund\u2019s net\nassets will be distributed to then-current\nshareholders pursuant to a plan of\nliquidation. Each Fund\u2019s termination\n\nwas approved by a majority of the Trust\u2019s\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and does not\nrequire additional approval by Fund\nshareholders. The Board may extend the\ntermination date if a majority of the Board\ndetermines the extension to be in the best\ninterest of the Fund.\n\nIn the SAI of each the iShares iBonds Dec 2034\nTerm Treasury ETF, iShares iBonds Dec 2044\nTerm Treasury ETF and iShares iBonds Dec 2054\nTerm Treasury ETF, the fourth and fifth\nparagraphs of the section entitled \u201cInvestment\nStrategies and Risks\u201d are deleted in their\nentirety and replaced with the following:\n\nThe Fund will invest at least 80% of its\nassets in the component securities of the\nUnderlying Index, and the Fund will invest at\nleast 90% of its assets in U.S. Treasury\nsecurities that BFA believes will help the\nFund track the Underlying Index, in each case\nexcept as described below.
