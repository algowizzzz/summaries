The Reorganization does not\nrequire your approval, and you are not being\nasked to vote.We do, however, ask that you\nreview the enclosed Combined\nProspectus/Information Statement, which\ncontains information about the Acquiring Fund,\noutlines certain aspects of the Target Fund\nand the Acquiring Fund and provides details\nabout the terms and conditions of the\nReorganization. You should review the Combined\nProspectus/Information Statement carefully and\nretain it for future reference. If the\nReorganization is completed, the Target Fund\nshares you own will be exchanged for shares of\nthe Acquiring Fund (plus cash in lieu of\nfractional shares, if any) with the same\naggregate net asset value as your Target Fund\nshares. It is currently anticipated that the\nReorganization of the Target Fund will be\neffected on a tax-freebasis for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, except for any taxes that\nmay be imposed as a result of the receipt of\ncash in lieu of fractional shares. As\ndescribed in the Combined\nProspectus/Information Statement, BlackRock\nFund Advisors, the Target Fund and Acquiring\nFund\u0092s investment adviser, has proposed the\nReorganization because during the year prior\nto the Target Fund\u0092s maturity date, its\nallocation of assets is expected to be similar\nto that of the Acquiring Fund. As disclosed in\nthe Target Fund\u0092s prospectus, as the Target\nFund\u0092s target date approaches, the Target Fund\nand the Acquiring Fund are expected to,\nsubject to approval by the Board, merge into a\nsingle fund. The Combined Fund may give rise\nto operating efficiencies from a larger net\nasset size managed in a single vehicle. The\nBoard of Trustees of the Trust believes the\nReorganization is in the best interest of the\nTarget Fund and has approved the\nReorganization. As always, we appreciate your\nsupport.\n                                         \n  Sincerely,                             \n  Jessica Tan                            \n  President                              \n  iShares LifePath Target Date 2025 ETF  \n  iShares Trust                          \n  400 Howard Street                      \n  San Francisco, California 94105        \n  (415) 670-2000                         \n                                         \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nQUESTIONS & ANSWERS We recommend that you read\nthe complete Combined Prospectus/Information\nStatement.

The Target\nFund and the Acquiring Fund pursue a similar\ninvestment objective and employ substantially\nsimilar investment strategies to achieve its\nrespective investment objective. The\ninvestment objective of each Fund is as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  Fund              Investment Objective      \n                    Seeks to provide          \n                    retirement outcomes       \n                    through exposure to a     \n  Target Fund       broad portfolio of ETFs   \n                    which adjusts its         \n                    allocation as it          \n                    approaches its target     \n                    date.                     \n                    Seeks to provide          \n                    exposure to a             \n  Acquiring Fund    conservative, broad       \n                    portfolio of ETFs         \n                    covering global asset\u00a0    \n                    classes.                  \n                                              \nFor more information on the Funds\u0092 investment\nstrategies, see \u0093Summary \u0097 Investment\nObjectives and Principal Investment\nStrategies\u0094 below.

Immediately\nthereafter, the Target Fund will distribute\nAcquiring Fund Shares and cash in lieu of\nfractional shares, if any, to its shareholders\npro rata. After such distribution, the Target\nFund will be terminated, dissolved and\nliquidated as a series of the Trust.\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe Reorganization is expected to qualify as a\ntax-freereorganization for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. The aggregate net asset value\n(\u0093NAV\u0094) of the Acquiring Fund Shares received\nin the Reorganization by the Target Fund will\nequal the aggregate NAV of the shares of the\nTarget Fund held by such shareholders of the\nTarget Fund immediately prior to the\nReorganization, minus cash received by the\nshareholder in lieu of fractional shares of\nthe Acquiring Fund, if any. As a result of the\nReorganization, however, a shareholder\u0092s\ninterest will represent a smaller percentage\nof ownership in the Combined Fund than such\nshareholder\u0092s percentage of ownership in the\nTarget Fund immediately prior to the\nReorganization.

Each Fund\npublicly offers its shares on a continuous\nbasis, and individual shares may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. The investment\nobjectives and investment strategies,\nprincipal risks, performance, fees and\nexpenses and other comparative information\nconcerning the Target Fund and the Acquiring\nFund are discussed below. Board Approval and\nStructure of the Reorganization. The Board of\nTrustees of the Trust (the \u0093Board\u0094), including\nall of the Trustees who are not \u0093interested\npersons\u0094 (as defined in the Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as amended (the \u00931940 Act\u0094)) (the\n\u0093Independent Board Members\u0094), has approved the\nreorganization of the Target Fund into the\nAcquiring Fund (the \u0093Reorganization\u0094). The\nReorganization provides for:\n                                              \n      the transfer and delivery of            \n      substantially all of the assets of the  \n      Target Fund to the Acquiring Fund in    \n      exchange                                \n      for the assumption by the Acquiring     \n      Fund of certain stated liabilities of   \n      the Target Fund and newly-issued        \n      shares of the Acquiring Fund (the       \n      \u0093Acquiring Fund Shares\u0094) and cash in      \n      lieu of fractional shares, if any;      \n                                              \n                                              \n      the distribution of the Acquiring Fund  \n      Shares and cash in lieu of fractional   \n      shares, if any, pro rata by             \n      the Target Fund to its shareholders;    \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      the termination, dissolution and        \n      liquidation of the Target Fund as a     \n      series of the Trust.                    \n                                              \nThe Acquiring Fund, following completion of\nthe Reorganization, may be referred to as the\n\u0093Combined Fund\u0094 in this Combined\nProspectus/Information Statement. 1.1\nBackground and Reasons for the Reorganization\nBFA has proposed the Reorganization because\nthe Funds are part of a group of funds\nreferred to as the \u0093LifePath ETFs,\u0094 each of\nwhich seeks to provide for retirement outcomes\nbased on quantitatively measured risk that\ninvestors on average may be willing to accept\ngiven a particular time horizon, pursuant to\nwhich the Target Fund will have a similar\ninvestment objective and substantially similar\ninvestment policies, strategies, restrictions\nand risks as the Acquiring Fund as the target\ndate of the Target Fund approaches in 2025. As\ndisclosed in the Target Fund\u0092s prospectus, as\nthe Target Fund\u0092s target date approaches, the\nTarget Fund and the - 1 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nAcquiring Fund are expected to, subject to\napproval by the Board, merge into a single\nfund. The Combined Fund may give rise to\noperating efficiencies from a larger net asset\nsize managed in a single vehicle. BFA will\ncontinue as the investment adviser of the\nCombined Fund after the Reorganization and no\nchange in portfolio managers will result from\nthe Reorganization. In addition, no increase\nin advisory or other fee rates will result\nfrom the Reorganization. The Target Fund and\nthe Acquiring Fund have the same expense\nstructure and the same types of fees. The fees\nof the Acquiring Fund and the Target Fund may\ndiffer only to the extent the acquired fund\nfees and expense incurred by each Fund differ.\nAssuming the Reorganization had occurred on\nJuly 31, 2024, the Combined Fund would have\n(A) total annual fund operating expenses that\nare estimated to be the same as the Target\nFund prior to the Reorganization and (B) net\nannual fund operating expenses that are\nestimated to be the same as the Target Fund\nprior to the Reorganization. The portfolio\nmanagers of the Acquiring Fund have reviewed\nthe portfolio holdings of the Target Fund and,\nas of July 31, 2024, all the securities held\nby the Target Fund comply with the compliance\nguidelines and/or investment restrictions of\nthe Acquiring Fund. The Acquiring Fund may\nsell securities of the Target Fund acquired in\nthe Reorganization in preparation for, or as a\nresult of, the Reorganization, to the extent\nTarget Fund shareholders receive cash in lieu\nof fractional shares of the Acquiring Fund.\nMinimal transaction costs are anticipated to\nbe incurred with the Reorganization. At a\nmeeting held on June 4-5,2024 (the \u0093Approval\nMeeting\u0094), the Board, including all of the\nIndependent Board Members, approved the\nAgreement and Plan of Reorganization (the\n\u0093Reorganization Agreement\u0094). The Board\ndetermined that, based on an assumption that\nall of the facts and circumstances existing at\nthe time of closing of the Reorganization are\nnot materially different from those presented\nto the Board at the Approval Meeting, the\nReorganization is in the best interest of each\nFund and that the interests of each Fund\u0092s\nshareholders will not be diluted as a result\nof the Reorganization. The Board\u0092s\ndeterminations were based on a comprehensive\nevaluation of the information provided to it.\nDuring the review, the Board did not identify\nany particular information or consideration\nthat was all-importantor controlling. (a)\nResults of Process In reaching its\ndeterminations with respect to the\nReorganization, the Board considered a number\nof factors presented at the time of the\nApproval Meeting, including, but not limited\nto, the following:\n                                              \n      the shareholders of the Target Fund     \n      will remain invested in a diversified,  \n      open-end fund that is part of the       \n      LifePath ETFs\u0092 investment program;       \n                                              \n                                              \n      the investment objective of the Target  \n      Fund is similar to the Acquiring Fund,  \n      although there are certain              \n      differences. The principal investment   \n      risks, strategies and restrictions of   \n      the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund  \n      are substantially similar. The Board    \n      considered the principal differences    \n      in the investment objectives between    \n      the Target Fund and the                 \n      Acquiring Fund.

The investment objective of each Fund\nis as follows:\n                                              \n  Fund              Investment Objective      \n                    The Target Fund seeks to  \n                    provide retirement        \n                    outcomes through          \n  Target Fund       exposure to a\u00a0broad       \n                    portfolio of ETFs which   \n                    adjusts its allocation    \n                    as it approaches its      \n                    target date.              \n                    The Acquiring Fund seeks  \n                    to provide exposure to a  \n  Acquiring Fund    conservative, broad       \n                    portfolio of ETFs         \n                    covering global asset     \n                    classes.                  \n                                              \nThe Target Fund\u0092s investment objective\nspecifies that to meet its objective, the\nTarget Fund will adjust its asset allocation\nas it approaches its target date, while the\nAcquiring Fund provides exposure to a\nconservative portfolio of ETFs. However, as\nthe Target Fund approaches its target date of\n2025, it is entering into its most\nconservative phase and its asset allocation\nwill mirror that of the Acquiring Fund. The\ninvestment objective of each Fund is non-\nfundamental,which means that it may be changed\nwithout approval of the Fund\u0092s shareholders.\nFollowing completion of the Reorganization,\nthe Combined Fund will have the same non-\nfundamentalinvestment objective as the\nAcquiring Fund. - 3 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nPrincipal Investment Strategies.

A\nhigher portfolio turnover rate may indicate\nhigher transaction costs and may cause the\nFunds to incur increased expenses. These\ncosts, which are not reflected in the Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example\n(except costs to Underlying Funds included as\npart of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses),\naffect the Funds\u0092 performance. Portfolio\nturnover rates exclude portfolio securities\nreceived or delivered as a result of\nprocessing capital share transactions in\nCreation Units (as defined in each Fund\u0092s\nProspectus). For the period since the Funds\u0092\ninception through July 31, 2024, the portfolio\nturnover rate for each Fund was as follows:\n                             \n  Fund              Rate     \n  Target Fund         10  %  \n  Acquiring Fund      10  %  \n                             \n1.4 U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences The\nReorganization is expected to qualify as a\ntax-free\u0093reorganization\u0094 under Section 368(a)\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u0093Code\u0094). In general, if the\nReorganization so qualifies, the Target Fund\nand the Acquiring Fund will not recognize gain\nor loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nfrom the transactions contemplated by the\nReorganization (except for any gain or loss\nthat may be required to be recognized solely\nas a result of the close of the Target Fund\u0092s\ntaxable year due to the Reorganization or as a\nresult of the transfer of certain assets). As\na condition to the closing of the\nReorganization, the Trust, on behalf of the\nTarget Fund and the Acquiring Fund, will\nreceive an opinion from Willkie Farr &\nGallagher LLP to the effect that the\nReorganization will qualify as a tax-\nfreereorganization under Section 368 of the\nCode. An opinion of counsel is not binding on\nthe Internal Revenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094) or\nany court and thus does not preclude the IRS\nfrom asserting, or a court from rendering, a\ncontrary position. If any of the portfolio\nassets of the Target Fund are sold, or deemed\nsold as a result of the termination of the\nTarget Fund\u0092s taxable year due to the\nReorganization or as a result of the transfer\nof an interest in a passive foreign investment\ncompany, the tax impact of such sales, deemed\nsales or transfers will depend on the\ndifference between the price at which such\nportfolio assets are sold, deemed sold or\ntransferred, and the Target Fund\u0092s basis in\nsuch assets. Any gains will be distributed to\nthe Target Fund\u0092s shareholders as either\ncapital gain dividends (to the extent of long-\nterm capital gains) or ordinary dividends (to\nthe extent of ordinary income or short-term\ncapital gains) during or with respect to the\nyear of sale, deemed sale or transfer, and\nsuch distributions will be taxable to\nshareholders in non-taxqualified accounts. In\naddition, prior to the Reorganization, the\nTarget Fund will distribute to its\nshareholders all investment company taxable\nincome, net tax-exemptincome and net - 5 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nrealized capital gains not previously\ndistributed to shareholders, and such\ndistribution of investment company taxable\nincome, net tax-exempt income and\nnet realized capital gains will be taxable to\nshareholders in non-tax qualified accounts.\n\nAt any\ntime before the Reorganization takes place, a\nshareholder may sell shares of the Target\nFund.

In\naddition, this section\nprovides performance information and\ninformation regarding management of the Target\nFund and the Acquiring Fund and each of their\ninvestment advisory and administration\nagreements, as well as information about each\nFund\u0092s other service\nproviders. This section also provides\ninformation about dividends and distributions,\nprocedures for the purchase, sale and\nvaluation of shares and market timing policies\nto the extent there are differences.\n\n2.1 Principal Investment Strategies\n\nDescription of the Target Fund\u0092s Principal\nStrategies\n\nThe Target Fund is actively managed and\nallocates and reallocates its assets among a\ncombination of Underlying Funds in proportions\nbased on\nits own investment strategy.\n\nThe Target Fund is one of a group of funds\nreferred to as the \u0093LifePath ETFs,\u0094 each of\nwhich seeks\nto provide for retirement outcomes based on\nquantitatively measured risk that investors on\naverage may be willing to accept given a\nparticular time horizon.\n\nBFA employs a multi-dimensional approach to\nassess risk for the Target Fund and to\ndetermine its allocation across asset classes.\nAs part of\nthis multi-dimensional approach, BFA aims to\nquantify risk using proprietary risk\nmeasurement tools that, among other things,\nanalyze historical and forward-looking\nsecurities market data, including risk, asset\nclass correlations, and expected\nreturns. Under normal circumstances, the\nTarget Fund intends to invest primarily in\naffiliated exchange-traded funds (\u0093ETFs\u0094).\n\nThe Target Fund will invest, under normal\ncircumstances, at least 80% of its assets in\nsecurities or other financial instruments that\nare\ncomponents of or have economic characteristics\nsimilar to the securities included in its\ncustom model benchmark, the 2025 Target Date\nCustom Benchmark. BFA will not publish its\ncustom benchmark but will apply a proprietary\nmodel to monitor\nperformance of the Target Fund. The Target\nFund is designed for investors expecting to\nretire or to begin withdrawing assets around\nthe year 2025. At inception, BFA expected the\nTarget Fund to hold approximately 43.50% of\nits assets in Underlying\nFunds that seek to track particular underlying\nindexes of equity securities, approximately\n56.50% of its assets in Underlying Funds that\nseek to track particular fixed-income indexes\nand the remainder of its assets in Underlying\nFunds that invest\nprimarily in money market instruments.\n\nAt inception, the Target Fund invested in the\niShares 0-5\nYear TIPS Bond ETF, iShares 1-5 Year\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares\n5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF,\niShares 10+ Year Investment Grade\nCorporate Bond ETF, iShares 10-20 Year\nTreasury Bond ETF, iShares Core MSCI Emerging\nMarkets ETF, iShares Core MSCI International\nDeveloped Markets ETF, iShares Core U.S. REIT\nETF, iShares Global\nInfrastructure ETF, iShares MBS ETF, iShares\nRussell 1000 ETF, iShares Russell 2000 ETF,\niShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF and money\nmarket funds advised by BFA or its affiliates.\nFactors such as fund classifications,\nhistorical risk and performance,\nand the relationship to other Underlying Funds\nin the Target Fund are considered when\nselecting Underlying Funds. The specific\nUnderlying Funds selected for the Target Fund\nare determined at BFA\u0092s discretion and may\nchange as deemed appropriate\nto allow the Target Fund to meet its\ninvestment objective.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the Target Fund\u0092s\nasset allocation will\nchange over time according to a predetermined\n\u0093glide path\u0094 as the Target Fund approaches its\ntarget date. The glide path below represents\nthe shifting of asset classes over time. As\nthe glide path shows, as time elapses prior to\nretirement, the Target Fund\u0092s\n\n- 7 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nasset allocations become more conservative.\nThis reflects the need for reduced investment\nrisk as retirement approaches and the need for\nlower volatility of the Target Fund, which for\ncertain investors may be a primary source of\nincome after retirement. During the year prior\nto the Target Fund\u0092s maturity date, its\nallocation of assets is expected to be similar\nto that of the Acquiring Fund. Further, as\nretirement approaches, the Target Fund and the\nAcquiring Fund are expected to, subject to\napproval by the Board, merge into a single\nfund. The following chart illustrates the\nglide path \u0097 the target allocation among asset\nclasses as the LifePath ETFs approach their\ntarget dates: The following table lists the\ntarget allocation by years until retirement:\n                                              \n                Equity\u00a0                       \n  Years to      Allocation      Fixed-Income  \n  Retirement    (including\u00a0     Allocation    \n                REITs)                        \n  45            99%             1%            \n  40            99%             1%            \n  35            99%             1%            \n  30            98%             2%            \n  25            95%             5%            \n  20            87%             13%           \n  15            77%             23%           \n  10            65%             35%           \n  5             53%             47%           \n  0             40%             60%           \n                                              \nThe asset allocation targets are established\nby the Target Fund\u0092s portfolio managers. The\ninvestment team, including the portfolio\nmanagers, meets regularly to assess market\nconditions, review the asset allocation\ntargets of the Target Fund, and determine\nwhether any changes are required to enable the\nFund to achieve its investment objective.\nAlthough the asset allocation targets listed\nfor the glide path are general, long-term\ntargets, BFA may periodically adjust the\nproportion of equity and fixed-income\nUnderlying Funds in the Target Fund, based on\nan assessment of the current market\nconditions, the potential contribution of each\nasset class to the expected risk and return\ncharacteristics of - 8 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nthe Target Fund, reallocations of the Target\nFund\u0092s composition to reflect intra-year\nmovement along the glide path and other\nfactors. In general, such adjustments will be\nlimited; however,\nBFA may determine that a greater degree of\nvariation is warranted to protect the Target\nFund or achieve its investment objective.\n\nBFA\u0092s second step in the structuring of the\nTarget Fund is the selection of the Underlying\nFunds. Factors such as fund classifications,\nhistorical risk and performance, and the\nrelationship to other Underlying Funds in the\nTarget Fund are considered when selecting\nUnderlying Funds. The specific Underlying\nFunds selected for the Target Fund are\ndetermined at BFA\u0092s discretion and\nmay change as deemed appropriate to allow the\nTarget Fund to meet its investment objective.\n\nWithin the prescribed percentage allocations\nto equity and fixed-income index funds, BFA\nseeks to diversify the Target Fund. The\nallocation to Underlying Funds that track\nequity indexes may be further diversified by\nstyle (including both value and growth),\nmarket capitalization (including\nemerging growth, large-, mid-, and small-\ncapitalization), region (i.e., U.S, and\ninternational, including emerging markets) or\nother attributes. The allocation to Underlying\nFunds that track fixed-income\nindexes may be further diversified by sector\n(including government, corporate, U.S. agency\nMBS or debentures, CMBS, and other sectors),\nduration (a measurement of interest rate\nrisk), credit quality (including investment\ngrade bonds and high yield\nbonds), geographic location (including U.S.\nand non-U.S. securities, including bonds of\nemerging market issuers), currency (U.S.\ndollar-denominated or local currency bonds) or\nother attributes. Though BFA\nseeks to diversify the Target Fund, certain\nUnderlying Funds may concentrate their\ninvestments in specific sectors or geographic\nregions or countries. The percentage\nallocation to the various styles of equity and\nfixed-income Underlying Funds is\ndetermined at the discretion of the investment\nteam and can be changed to reflect the current\nmarket environment.\n\nCertain Underlying\nFunds may invest in real estate investment\ntrusts (\u0093REITs\u0094), foreign securities, emerging\nmarket securities, high yield bonds and\nderivative securities or instruments, such as\noptions and futures, the value of which is\nderived from another\nsecurity, a currency or commodity, an interest\nrate or an index, when seeking to match the\nperformance of a particular market index. The\nTarget Fund and certain Underlying Funds may\nalso lend securities with a value up to one-\nthird of their respective total assets to\nfinancial institutions that provide cash or\nsecurities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\nGovernment as collateral.\n\nDescription of the Combined Fund\u0092s Principal\nInvestment Strategies\n\nThe Combined Fund\u0092s principal investment\nstrategies are expected to be the same as the\nAcquiring Fund\u0092s investment strategies.\n\nThe Acquiring Fund is actively managed and\nallocates and reallocate its assets among a\ncombination of Underlying Funds in proportions\nbased on\nits own investment strategy.\n\nThe Acquiring Fund is one of a group of funds\nreferred to as the \u0093LifePath ETFs,\u0094 each of\nwhich\nseeks to provide for retirement outcomes based\non quantitatively measured risk that investors\non average may be willing to accept given a\nparticular time horizon.\n\nBFA employs a multi-dimensional approach to\nassess risk for the Acquiring Fund and to\ndetermine the Acquiring Fund\u0092s allocation\nacross\nasset classes. As part of this multi-\ndimensional approach, BFA aims to quantify\nrisk using proprietary risk measurement tools\nthat, among other things, analyze historical\nand forward-looking securities market data,\nincluding risk, asset class\ncorrelations, and expected returns. Under\nnormal circumstances, the Acquiring Fund\nintends to invest primarily in affiliated\nETFs.\n\nThe\nAcquiring Fund will invest, under normal\ncircumstances, at least 80% of its assets in\nsecurities or other financial instruments that\nare components of or have economic\ncharacteristics similar to the securities\nincluded in its custom model benchmark,\nthe Retirement Custom Benchmark. BFA will not\npublish the Retirement Custom\n\n- 9 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nBenchmark but will apply a proprietary model\nto monitor performance of the Fund. The\nAcquiring Fund is designed for investors\nexpecting to retire or to begin withdrawing\nassets in the future. At\ninception, BFA expected the Acquiring Fund to\nhold approximately 40% of its assets in\nUnderlying Funds that seek to track particular\nequity indexes, approximately 60% of its\nassets in Underlying Funds that seek to track\nparticular fixed-income\nindexes and the remainder of its assets in\nUnderlying Funds that invest primarily in\nmoney market instruments.\n\nAt inception, the\nAcquiring Fund invested in the iShares 0-5\nYear TIPS Bond ETF, iShares 1-5 Year\nInvestment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares\n5-10\nYear Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF,\niShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate\nBond ETF, iShares 10-20 Year Treasury Bond\nETF, iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF,\niShares Core MSCI International\nDeveloped Markets ETF, iShares Core U.S. REIT\nETF, iShares Global Infrastructure ETF,\niShares MBS ETF, iShares Russell 1000 ETF,\niShares Russell 2000 ETF, iShares U.S.\nTreasury Bond ETF and money market funds\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates.\nFactors such as fund classifications,\nhistorical risk and performance, and the\nrelationship to other Underlying Funds in the\nFund are considered when selecting Underlying\nFunds. The specific Underlying Funds selected\nfor the Acquiring Fund are\ndetermined at BFA\u0092s discretion and may change\nas deemed appropriate to allow the Acquiring\nFund to meet its investment objective.\n\nCertain Underlying Funds may invest in REITs,\nforeign securities, emerging market\nsecurities, high yield bonds and derivative\nsecurities or\ninstruments, such as options and futures, the\nvalue of which is derived from another\nsecurity, a currency or commodity, an interest\nrate or an index, when seeking to match the\nperformance of a particular market index. The\nAcquiring Fund and certain\nUnderlying Funds may also lend securities with\na value up to one-third of their respective\ntotal assets to financial institutions that\nprovide cash or securities issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. Government as\ncollateral.\n\nThe Acquiring Fund\u0092s selection of Underlying\nFunds that track equity indexes may be further\ndiversified by style\n(including both value and growth), market\ncapitalization (including large cap, mid cap,\nsmall cap and emerging growth), region\n(including domestic and international\n(including emerging markets)) or other\nfactors. The Acquiring Fund\u0092s selection\nof Underlying Funds that track fixed-income\nindexes may be further diversified by sector\n(including government, corporate, agency, and\nother sectors), duration (a calculation of the\naverage life of a bond which measures its\nprice risk), credit\nquality (including non-investment grade debt\nor junk bonds), geographic location (including\nU.S. and foreign-issued securities), or other\nfactors. Though BFA seeks to diversify the\nAcquiring Fund, certain\nUnderlying Funds may concentrate their\ninvestments in specific sectors or geographic\nregions or countries. The percentage\nallocation to the various styles of equity and\nfixed-income Underlying Funds is determined at\nthe discretion of the investment\nteam and can be changed to reflect the current\nmarket environment. Because the Fund is in its\nmost conservative phase, its allocation\ngenerally does not de-risk over time, although\nits allocation may change to\nmaintain the Fund\u0092s risk profile.\n\n2.2 Principal Investment Risks\n\nBecause of their similar investment objectives\nand investment strategies (as described above\nunder \u0093Summary \u0097 Investment Objectives\nand Principal Investment Strategies\u0094), the\nTarget Fund and the Acquiring Fund are subject\nto identical principal investment risks\nassociated with an investment in the relevant\nFund. The principal investment risks of the\nCombined Fund will be\nthe same as those of the Target Fund and the\nAcquiring Fund. A description of the principal\nrisks of the Combined Fund are set out below.\nThe order of the below risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any particular\nrisk factor.\n\nDescriptions of the Combined Fund\u0092s Principal\nInvestment Risks\n\nAs with any investment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the Combined Fund,\nand the Combined Fund\u0092s performance could\ntrail that of other investments. The Combined\nFund is subject to certain risks, including\nthe principal risks noted below (either\ndirectly or through its investments in the\nUnderlying\n\n- 10 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nFunds), any of which may adversely affect the\nCombined Fund\u0092s NAV, trading price, yield,\ntotal return and ability to meet its\ninvestment objective. Certain key risks are\nprioritized below\n(with others following in alphabetical order),\nbut the relative significance of any risk is\ndifficult to predict and may change over time.\nYou should review each risk factor carefully.\n\nEquity Securities Risk. Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value, and their values\nmay be more volatile than those of\nother asset classes. Certain Underlying Funds\ninvest in common stocks, which generally\nsubject their holders to more risks than\npreferred stocks and debt securities because\ncommon stockholders\u0092 claims are subordinated\nto those of holders\nof preferred stocks and debt securities upon\nthe bankruptcy of the issuer.\n\nCredit Risk. Debt issuers and other\ncounterparties may be unable or unwilling to\nmake timely interest and/or principal payments\nwhen due or otherwise honor their obligations.\nChanges in an issuer\u0092s credit rating or the\nmarket\u0092s perception of an issuer\u0092s\ncreditworthiness\nmay also adversely affect the value of the\nFund\u0092s or an Underlying Fund\u0092s investment in\nthat issuer. The degree of credit risk depends\non an issuer\u0092s or counterparty\u0092s financial\ncondition and on the terms of an obligation.\n\nInterest Rate Risk. During periods of very low\nor negative interest rates, the Fund may be\nunable to maintain positive returns\nor pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Very\nlow or negative interest rates may magnify\ninterest rate risk. Changing interest rates,\nincluding rates that fall below zero, may have\nunpredictable effects on markets, result in\nheightened market\nvolatility and detract from the Fund\u0092s\nperformance to the extent the Fund is exposed\nto such interest rates. Additionally, under\ncertain market conditions in which interest\nrates are low and the market prices for\nportfolio securities have\nincreased, the Fund may have a very low or\neven negative yield. A low or negative yield\nwould cause the Fund to lose money in certain\nconditions and over certain time periods. An\nincrease in interest rates will generally\ncause the value of\nsecurities held by the Fund or an Underlying\nFund to decline, may lead to heightened\nvolatility in the fixed-income markets and may\nadversely affect the liquidity of certain\nfixed-income investments, including those held\nby the Fund or an Underlying\nFund. Because rates on certain floating rate\ndebt securities typically reset only\nperiodically, changes in prevailing interest\nrates (and particularly sudden and significant\nchanges) can be expected to cause some\nfluctuations in the net asset value\nof the Fund to the extent that it invests in\nfloating rate debt securities. The\nhistorically low interest rate environment in\nrecent years heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates.\n\nU.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other securities\nin their interest rates, maturities,\ntimes of issuance and other characteristics\nand may provide relatively lower returns than\nthose of other securities. Similar to other\nissuers, changes to the financial condition or\ncredit rating of a government may cause the\nvalue of the Fund\u0092s\nor an Underlying Fund\u0092s U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline.\n\nAllocation Risk. The Fund\u0092s ability to achieve\nits\ninvestment objective depends upon BFA\u0092s\nability to develop a model that accurately\nassesses the Fund\u0092s asset class allocation and\nselects an appropriate mix of Underlying Funds\nand other ETFs. There is a risk that BFA\u0092s\nevaluations\nand assumptions regarding asset classes or\nUnderlying Funds, which are utilized as inputs\nin the model, may be incorrect in view of\nactual market conditions.\n\nInvestment in Underlying Funds Risk. The Fund\ninvests substantially all of its assets in the\nUnderlying Funds, so the\nFund\u0092s investment performance is directly\nrelated to the performance of the Underlying\nFunds. The Fund\u0092s NAV will change with changes\nin the value of the Underlying Funds and other\nsecurities in which the Fund invests based on\ntheir market\nvaluations. An investment in the Fund will\nentail more costs and expenses than a direct\ninvestment in the Underlying Funds.\n\nAs the\nUnderlying Funds, or the Fund\u0092s allocations\namong the Underlying Funds, change from time\nto time, or to the extent that the total\nannual fund operating expenses of any\nUnderlying Fund change, the weighted average\noperating expenses borne by the\nFund may increase or decrease.\n\nAffiliated Fund Risk. In managing the Fund,\nBFA has the ability to select Underlying Funds\nand substitute Underlying Funds with other\nETFs that it believes will achieve the Fund\u0092s\nobjective. BFA may be subject to\n\n- 11 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \npotential conflicts of interest in selecting\nUnderlying Funds and substituting Underlying\nFunds with other ETFs because the fees paid to\nBFA by some Underlying Funds and other ETFs\nmanaged by BFA\nmay be higher than the fees paid by other\nUnderlying Funds. If an Underlying Fund or\nother ETF holds interests in an affiliated\nfund in excess of a certain amount, the Fund\nmay be prohibited from purchasing shares of\nthat Underlying Fund or other\nETF.\n\nRetirement Income Risk. The Retirement Fund\ndoes not provide a guarantee that sufficient\ncapital appreciation will be\nachieved to provide adequate income at and\nthrough retirement. The Retirement Fund also\ndoes not ensure that you will have assets in\nyour account sufficient to cover your\nretirement expenses; this will depend on the\namount of money you have invested\nin the Retirement Fund, the length of time you\nhave held your investment, the returns of the\nmarkets over time, the amount you spend in\nretirement, and your other assets and income\nsources.\n\nSelection Risk. Selection risk is the risk\nthat the securities selected by the Retirement\nFund management will underperform the\nmarkets, the relevant indices or the\nsecurities selected by other funds with\nsimilar investment objectives and investment\nstrategies. This means you may lose money.\n\nMarket Risk. The Fund and the Underlying Funds\ncould lose money over short periods due to\nshort-term market movements and\nover longer periods during more prolonged\nmarket downturns. Local, regional or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism, public\nhealth issues, recessions, the prospect or\noccurrence of a sovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the\nFund, the Underlying Funds and their\ninvestments and could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the Fund\u0092s or\nUnderlying Fund\u0092s NAV.\n\nAsset ClassRisk. Securities and other assets\nin the Fund\u0092s or an Underlying Fund\u0092s\nportfolio may underperform in comparison to\nthe general financial markets, a particular\nfinancial market or other asset classes.\n\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk.\nOnly an Authorized Participant (as defined in\nthe Creations and Redemptions of each\nFund\u0092s Prospectuses may engage in creation or\nredemption transactions directly with the\nFund, and none of those Authorized\nParticipants is obligated to engage in\ncreation and/or redemption transactions. The\nFund has a limited number of\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants on an agency basis (i.e., on\nbehalf of other market participants). To the\nextent that Authorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or are unable to proceed with\ncreation or redemption orders with\nrespect to the Fund and no other Authorized\nParticipant is able to step forward to create\nor redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to\ntrade at a premium or discount to NAV and\npossibly face trading halts or delisting.\n\nCall Risk. During periods of falling interest\nrates, an issuer of a callable bond held by\nthe Fund or an Underlying Fund may\n\u0093call\u0094 or repay the security before its stated\nmaturity, and the Fund or an Underlying Fund\nmay have to reinvest the proceeds in\nsecurities with lower yields, which would\nresult in a decline in the Fund\u0092s income, or\nin securities with\ngreater risks or with other less favorable\nfeatures.\n\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk\nof loss, including losses due to adverse\nevents that affect the Fund\u0092s investments more\nthan the market as a whole, to the extent that\nthe Fund\u0092s or an Underlying Fund\u0092s investments\nare concentrated in the securities and/or\nother\nassets of a particular issuer or issuers,\ncountry, group of countries, region, market,\nindustry, group of industries, sector, market\nsegment or asset class.\n\nCurrency Risk. Because the Fund\u0092s and the\nUnderlying Funds\u0092 NAVs are determined in U.S.\ndollars, the Fund\u0092s NAV\ncould decline if a currency of a non-U.S.\nmarket in which a Fund or an Underlying Fund\ninvests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or\nif there are delays or limits on repatriation\nof such currency. Currency\nexchange rates can be very volatile and can\nchange quickly and unpredictably. As a result,\nthe Fund\u0092s NAV may change quickly and without\nwarning.\n\nCybersecurity Risk. Failures or breaches of\nthe electronic systems of the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds, the Funds\u0092 or the\nUnderlying Funds\u0092 adviser, distributor, the\nbenchmark provider and other service\nproviders, market makers, Authorized\nParticipants or the issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests have the ability to\ncause disruptions, negatively impact\nthe Fund\u0092s business operations and/or\npotentially result in financial losses to the\n\n- 12 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nFund and its shareholders. While the Fund has\nestablished business continuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to address system\nbreaches or failures, there are inherent\nlimitations in\nsuch plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity plans and\nsystems of the Fund\u0092s benchmark provider and\nother service providers, market makers,\nAuthorized Participants or issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests.\n\nDerivatives Risk. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund may invest in certain types of\nderivatives contracts, including\nfutures, options and swaps, which can be more\nsensitive to changes in interest rates or to\nsudden fluctuations in market prices than\nconventional securities, which can result in\ngreater losses to the Fund.\n\nEnergy Sector Risk. The market value of\nsecurities in the energy sector may decline\nfor many reasons, including, among others,\nchanges in energy prices, energy supply and\ndemand, government regulations, costs related\nto exploration and production and energy\nconservation efforts. Companies in the energy\nsector may also be significantly impacted by\nnatural disasters, social\nand political unrest, war and environmental\ndamage and may also be at risk for increased\nlitigation and negative publicity or public\nperception. The energy sector may experience\nsignificant market volatility (e.g., as a\nresult of Russia\u0092s\ninvasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the\nresulting sanctions on Russia and other\nresponses by the U.S. and other actors).\n\nExtension Risk. During periods of rising\ninterest rates, certain debt obligations may\nbe paid off substantially more slowly than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply, resulting in a\ndecline in the Fund\u0092s income and potentially\nin the value of the Fund\u0092s or an Underlying\nFund\u0092s investments.\n\nFinancials Sector Risk. The performance of\ncompanies in the financials sector may be\nadversely impacted by many factors,\nincluding, among others, changes in government\nregulations, economic conditions, and interest\nrates, credit rating downgrades, adverse\npublic perception, exposure concentration and\ndecreased liquidity in credit markets. The\nimpact of changes in\nregulation of any individual financial\ncompany, or of the financials sector as a\nwhole, cannot be predicted. Cybersecurity\nincidents and technology malfunctions and\nfailures have become increasingly frequent and\nhave caused significant losses to\ncompanies in this sector, which may negatively\nimpact an Underlying Fund.\n\nGeographic Risk. A natural disaster could\noccur in a geographic region in which the Fund\nor an Underlying Fund invests, which could\nadversely affect the economy or the business\noperations of companies in the specific\ngeographic region, causing an adverse impact\non the Fund\u0092s or an\nUnderlying Fund\u0092s investments in, or which are\nexposed to, the affected region.\n\nHealthcare Sector Risk. The\nprofitability of companies in the healthcare\nsector may be affected by government\nregulations and government healthcare\nprograms, increases or decreases in the cost\nof medical products and services, an increased\nemphasis on outpatient services,\ndemand for medical products and services and\nproduct liability claims, among other factors.\nMany healthcare companies are heavily\ndependent on patent protection, and the\nexpiration of a company\u0092s patent may adversely\naffect that company\u0092s\nprofitability. Healthcare companies are\nsubject to competitive forces that may result\nin price discounting, and may be thinly\ncapitalized and susceptible to product\nobsolescence.\n\nIncome Risk. The Fund\u0092s income may decline if\ninterest rates fall. This decline in income\ncan occur because an Underlying\nFund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding\nsecurities as securities in an Underlying\nFund\u0092s portfolio mature, are near maturity or\nare called, securities are substituted, or an\nUnderlying Fund otherwise needs to purchase\nadditional bonds.\n\nIndexing Investment Risk. The Underlying Funds\nare not actively managed, and BFA generally\ndoes not attempt to take\ndefensive positions in the Underlying Funds\nunder any market conditions, including\ndeclining markets.\n\nIndustrials Sector Risk. Companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby changes in the supply of and demand for\nproducts and services, product obsolescence,\nclaims for environmental damage or product\nliability and changes in general economic\nconditions, among other factors.\n\n- 13 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nInfectious Illness Risk. A widespread outbreak\nof an infectious illness, such\nas the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in travel\nrestrictions, disruption of healthcare\nservices, prolonged quarantines,\ncancellations, supply chain disruptions,\nbusiness closures, lower consumer demand,\nlayoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and\nother significant economic, social and\npolitical impacts. Markets may experience\ntemporary closures, extreme volatility, severe\nlosses, reduced liquidity and increased\ntrading costs. Such events may\nadversely affect the Fund and its investments\nand may impact the Fund\u0092s ability to purchase\nor sell securities or cause elevated tracking\nerror and increased premiums or discounts to\nthe Fund\u0092s NAV. Despite the development of\nvaccines, the\nduration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its\neffects cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\nInformation Technology Sector Risk.\nInformation technology companies face intense\ncompetition and potentially rapid product\nobsolescence. They are also heavily dependent\non intellectual property rights and may be\nadversely affected by the loss or impairment\nof those rights. Companies in the information\ntechnology sector are facing increased\ngovernment and regulatory\nscrutiny and may be subject to adverse\ngovernment or regulatory action. Companies in\nthe software industry may be adversely\naffected by, among other things, the decline\nor fluctuation of subscription renewal rates\nfor their products and services and\nactual or perceived vulnerabilities in their\nproducts or services.\n\nInfrastructure Industry Risk. Companies in the\ninfrastructure industry may be subject to a\nvariety of factors that could adversely affect\ntheir business or operations, including high\ninterest costs in connection with capital\nconstruction programs, high degrees of\nleverage, costs associated with\ngovernmental, environmental and other\nregulations, the level of government spending\non infrastructure projects, and other factors.\n\nIssuer Risk. The performance of the Fund\ndepends on the performance of individual\nsecurities to which the Fund or an Underlying\nFund has exposure. Changes in the financial\ncondition or credit rating of an issuer of\nthose securities may cause the value of the\nsecurities to decline.\n\nLarge-Capitalization Companies Risk. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be less able than\nsmaller capitalization companies to\nadapt to changing market conditions. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be more mature\nand subject to more limited growth potential\ncompared with smaller capitalization\ncompanies. During different market cycles, the\nperformance of\nlarge-capitalization companies has trailed the\noverall performance of the broader securities\nmarkets.\n\nManagement Risk. The\nFund and the Underlying Funds are subject to\nmanagement risk, which is the risk that the\ninvestment process, techniques and risk\nanalyses applied by BFA will not produce the\ndesired results, and that securities selected\nby BFA may underperform the\nmarket or any relevant benchmark. In addition,\nlegislative, regulatory, or tax developments\nmay affect the investment techniques available\nto BFA in connection with managing the Fund\nand the Underlying Funds and may also\nadversely affect the ability\nof the Fund and the Underlying Funds to\nachieve their investment objective.\n\nMarket Trading Risk. The Fund and the\nUnderlying Funds face numerous market trading\nrisks, including the potential lack of an\nactive market for their shares, losses from\ntrading in secondary markets, periods of high\nvolatility and disruptions in the\ncreation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE\nFACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND\u0092S\nSHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO\nNAV.\n\nMid-CapitalizationCompanies Risk. Compared to\nlarge-capitalization companies, mid-\ncapitalization companies may be less stable\nand more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. In addition, the securities of\nmid-capitalization companies may be more\nvolatile and less liquid than those of large-\ncapitalization companies.\n\nNational Closed Market Trading Risk. To the\nextent that the underlying securities or other\ninstruments held by the Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds trade on foreign exchanges or\nin foreign markets that may be closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the Fund\u0092s or an\nUnderlying Fund\u0092s shares trade is open, there\nare likely to be deviations between the\ncurrent price\nof such an underlying security and the last\nquoted price for the underlying security\n(i.e., the Fund\u0092s or an Underlying Fund\u0092s\nquote from the closed foreign market). The\nimpact of a closed\n\n- 14 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nforeign market on the Fund or an Underlying\nFund is likely to be greater where a large\nportion of the Fund\u0092s or an Underlying Fund\u0092s\nunderlying securities or other instruments\ntrade on\nthat closed foreign market or when the foreign\nmarket is closed for unscheduled reasons.\nThese deviations could result in premiums or\ndiscounts to the Fund\u0092s or an Underlying\nFund\u0092s NAV that may be greater than those\nexperienced by other\nETFs.\n\nNon-U.S.Issuers Risk. Securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers carry different risks from\nsecurities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks\ninclude differences in accounting, auditing\nand financial reporting standards, the\npossibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation, adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations,\npolitical instability, regulatory and economic\ndifferences, and potential restrictions on the\nflow of international capital. The Fund is\nspecifically exposed to\nAsian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk\nand North American Economic Risk.\n\nNon-U.S.Securities Risk. Investments in the\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to\nthe risks associated with investing in those\nnon-U.S. markets, such as\nheightened risks of inflation or\nnationalization. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund may lose money due to political, economic\nand geographic events affecting issuers of\nnon-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In\naddition, non-U.S. securities markets may\ntrade a small number of securities and may be\nunable to respond effectively to changes in\ntrading volume,\npotentially making prompt liquidation of\nholdings difficult or impossible at times. The\nFund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic\nRisk, European Economic Risk and North\nAmerican Economic Risk.\n\nOperational Risk. The Fund and the Underlying\nFunds are exposed to operational risks arising\nfrom a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u0092s service providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or systems failures.\nThe Fund, the\nUnderlying Funds and BFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through controls and\nprocedures. However, these measures do not\naddress every possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant operational\nrisks.\n\nPrepayment Risk. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, issuers of certain debt\nobligations may repay principal prior to the\nsecurity\u0092s maturity, which may cause the Fund\nto have to reinvest in securities with lower\nyields or higher risk of default, resulting in\na decline in the Fund\u0092s income or return\npotential.\n\nReal Estate Investment Risk. Companies that\ninvest in real estate (\u0093Real Estate\nCompanies\u0094), such as REITs, real\nestate holding and operating companies and\nreal estate management or development\ncompanies, expose investors in the Fund to the\nrisks of owning real estate directly, as well\nas to risks that relate specifically to the\nway in which Real Estate\nCompanies are organized and operated. Real\nestate is highly sensitive to general and\nlocal economic conditions and developments,\nand characterized by intense competition and\nperiodic overbuilding. If the Fund\u0092s\ninvestments in Real Estate\nCompanies are concentrated in one geographic\nregion, industry or property type, the Fund\nwill be particularly subject to the risks\nassociated with that region, industry or\nproperty type. Many Real Estate Companies,\nincluding REITs, utilize\nleverage (and some may be highly leveraged),\nwhich increases investment risk and the risk\nnormally associated with debt financing, and\ncould potentially magnify the Fund\u0092s losses.\nRising interest rates could result in higher\ncosts of capital\nfor Real Estate Companies, which could\nnegatively affect a Real Estate Company\u0092s\nability to meet its payment obligations or its\nfinancing activity and could decrease the\nmarket prices for REITs and for properties\nheld by such REITs.\n\nReinvestment Risk. The Fund or an Underlying\nFund may invest a portion of its assets in\nshort-term fixed-income instruments and,\nas a result, may be adversely affected if\ninterest rates fall because they may have to\ninvest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds\nmature.\n\nRisk of Investing in China. Investments in\nChinese securities, including certain Hong\nKong-listed and U.S.-listed securities,\nsubject the Fund or the Underlying Funds to\nrisks specific to China. China may be subject\nto considerable degrees of economic, political\nand social instability. China is an emerging\nmarket and demonstrates significantly higher\nvolatility from time\nto time in comparison to developed markets.\nOver the last few decades,\n\n- 15 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nthe Chinese government has undertaken reform\nof economic and market practices and has\nexpanded the sphere of private ownership of\nproperty in China. However, Chinese markets\ngenerally continue to\nexperience inefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies resulting from governmental\ninfluence, a lack of publicly available\ninformation and/or political and social\ninstability.\n\nChinese companies are also subject to the risk\nthat Chinese authorities can intervene in\ntheir operations and structure. Internal\nsocial\nunrest or confrontations with neighboring\ncountries, including military conflicts in\nresponse to such events, may also disrupt\neconomic development in China and result in a\ngreater risk of currency fluctuations,\ncurrency non-convertibility, interest rate\nfluctuations and higher rates of inflation.\n\nChina has experienced\nsecurity concerns, such as terrorism and\nstrained international relations.\nAdditionally, China is alleged to have\nparticipated in state-sponsored cyberattacks\nagainst foreign companies and foreign\ngovernments. Actual and threatened responses\nto such\nactivity and strained international relations,\nincluding purchasing restrictions, sanctions,\ntariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese\ngovernment or Chinese companies, may impact\nChina\u0092s economy and Chinese issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests. Incidents involving China\u0092s or the\nregion\u0092s security may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely affect the\nChinese economy and the Fund\u0092s investments.\nExport growth continues to be a major driver\nof\nChina\u0092s rapid economic growth. Reduction in\nspending on Chinese products and services,\ninstitution of additional tariffs or other\ntrade barriers (including as a result of\nheightened trade tensions or a trade war\nbetween China and the U.S. or in\nresponse to actual or alleged Chinese cyber\nactivity) or a downturn in any of the\neconomies of China\u0092s key trading partners may\nhave an adverse impact on the Chinese economy.\n\nChinese companies, including Chinese companies\nthat are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not\nsubject to the same degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more developed\ncountries. As a result, information about the\nChinese securities in which the Fund invests\nmay be less reliable or complete. Chinese\ncompanies with securities\nlisted on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if\nthey do not meet U.S. accounting standards and\nauditor oversight requirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the liquidity and value\nof the securities. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining\ninformation necessary for investigations into\nor litigation against Chinese companies, and\nshareholders may have limited legal remedies.\nThe Fund is not actively managed and does not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations.\n\nRisk of Investing in Developed Countries. The\nFund\u0092s and the Underlying Fund\u0092s investment in\ndeveloped country\nissuers may subject the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency, security,\neconomic and other risks associated with\ndeveloped countries. Developed countries tend\nto represent a significant portion of the\nglobal economy and have generally\nexperienced slower economic growth than some\nless developed countries. Certain developed\ncountries have experienced security concerns,\nsuch as war, terrorism and strained\ninternational relations. Incidents involving a\ncountry\u0092s or region\u0092s\nsecurity may cause uncertainty in its markets\nand may adversely affect its economy and the\nFund\u0092s or an Underlying Fund\u0092s investments. In\naddition, developed countries may be adversely\nimpacted by changes to the economic conditions\nof\ncertain key trading partners, regulatory\nburdens, debt burdens and the price or\navailability of certain commodities.\n\nRisk of Investing in India. Investments in\nIndian issuers involve risks that are specific\nto India, including legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency and economic risks.\nPolitical and legal uncertainty, greater\ngovernment control over the economy,\ncurrency fluctuations or blockage, and the\nrisk of nationalization or expropriation of\nassets may result in higher potential for\nlosses. The securities markets in India are\nrelatively underdeveloped and may subject the\nFund or an Underlying Fund to\nhigher transaction costs or greater\nuncertainty than investments in more developed\nsecurities markets.\n\nRisk of Investing in Japan. The Japanese\neconomy may be subject to considerable degrees\nof economic, political and social instability,\nwhich could have a negative impact on Japanese\nsecurities. Since 2000, Japan\u0092s economic\ngrowth rate has generally remained\nlow relative to other advanced economies, and\nit may remain low in the future. In addition,\nJapan is subject to the risk of natural\ndisasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic\neruptions,\n\n- 16 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ntyphoons and tsunamis, which could negatively\naffect the Fund or an Underlying Fund. Japan\u0092s\nrelations with its neighbors have at times\nbeen strained, and strained relations may\ncause\nuncertainty in the Japanese markets and\nadversely affect the overall Japanese economy.\n\nRisk of Investing in Russia.\nInvesting in Russian securities involves\nsignificant risks, including legal,\nregulatory, currency and economic risks that\nare specific to Russia. In addition, investing\nin Russian securities involves risks\nassociated with the settlement of portfolio\ntransactions and loss of the Fund\u0092s or an\nUnderlying Fund\u0092s ownership rights in its\nportfolio securities as a result of the system\nof share registration and custody in Russia.\nGovernments in the U.S. and many other\ncountries have imposed\neconomic sanctions on certain Russian\nindividuals and Russian corporate and banking\nentities. A number of jurisdictions may also\ninstitute broader sanctions on Russia. Russia\nhas issued a number of countersanctions, some\nof which restrict the\ndistribution of profits by limited liability\ncompanies (e.g., dividends), and prohibit\nRussian persons from entering into\ntransactions with designated persons from\n\u0093unfriendly states\u0094 as well as the export of\nraw materials or other\nproducts from Russia to certain sanctioned\npersons. Russia launched a large-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The\nextent and duration of the military action,\nresulting sanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian\ngovernment, Russian companies, or Russian\nindividuals, including politicians, may impact\nRussia\u0092s economy and Russian companies in\nwhich the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests.\nActual and threatened responses to Russian\nmilitary action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors globally. Russian companies may\nbe unable to pay dividends\nand, if they pay dividends, the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may be unable to receive them.\nAs a result of sanctions, the Fund is\ncurrently restricted from trading in Russian\nsecurities, including those in its portfolio,\nwhile the Underlying Indexes\nof the Underlying Funds have removed Russian\nsecurities. It is unknown when, or if,\nsanctions may be lifted or the Fund\u0092s ability\nto trade in Russian securities will resume.\n\nRisk of Investing in Saudi Arabia. The ability\nof foreign investors (such as the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund) to invest in the\nsecurities of Saudi Arabian issuers is\nrelatively new. Such ability could be\nrestricted by the Saudi Arabian government at\nany time, and unforeseen risks could\nmaterialize with respect to foreign ownership\nin such securities. The economy of Saudi\nArabia is dominated by petroleum exports. A\nsustained decrease in petroleum prices could\nhave a negative impact on all aspects of the\neconomy. Investments in the securities of\nSaudi Arabian issuers involve risks not\ntypically associated with\ninvestments in securities of issuers in more\ndeveloped countries that may negatively affect\nthe value of the Fund\u0092s or Underlying Fund\u0092s\ninvestments. Such heightened risks may\ninclude, among others, expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets, restrictions on and\ngovernment intervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision\nmaking, armed conflict, crime\nand instability as a result of religious,\nethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. There\nremains the possibility that instability in\nthe larger Middle East region could adversely\nimpact the economy of Saudi Arabia, and there\nis no assurance of political\nstability in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi Arabia Broker Risk. There are a number\nof different ways of conducting transactions\nin\nequity securities in the Saudi Arabian market.\nThe Fund (or an Underlying Fund) generally\nexpects to conduct its transactions in a\nmanner in which the Fund would not be limited\nby Saudi Arabian regulations to a single\nbroker. However, there may be a\nlimited number of brokers who can provide\nservices to the Fund (or an Underlying Fund),\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the\nprices, quantity or timing of Fund (or an\nUnderlying Fund) transactions.\n\nRisk of Investing in Taiwan. Investments in\nTaiwanese issuers involve risks that are\nspecific to Taiwan, including legal,\nregulatory, political, currency and economic\nrisks. Political and economic developments of\nTaiwan\u0092s neighbors may have an adverse effect\non Taiwan\u0092s economy. Specifically, Taiwan\u0092s\ngeographic proximity and history of political\ncontention with China have resulted in ongoing\ntensions, which may materially affect the\nTaiwanese economy and its securities market.\n\n- 17 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nRisk of Investing in the U.S. Certain changes\nin the U.S. economy, such as\nwhen the U.S. economy weakens or when its\nfinancial markets decline, may have an adverse\neffect on the securities to which the Fund or\nthe Underlying Funds has exposure.\n\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund may engage in securities\nlending. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund or the Underlying Funds may lose\nmoney because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. The Fund or the\nUnderlying Funds could also lose money in the\nevent of a decline in the\nvalue of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund or an Underlying\nFund.\n\nSmall-Capitalization Companies Risk. Compared\nto mid- and large-capitalization\ncompanies, small-capitalization companies may\nbe less stable and more susceptible to adverse\ndevelopments. In addition, the securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies may be more\nvolatile and less liquid than those of mid-\nand large-capitalization companies.\n\nTax Risk. Because the Fund is expected to\ninvest\nin the Underlying Funds, the Fund\u0092s realized\nlosses on sales of shares of an Underlying\nFund may be indefinitely or permanently\ndeferred as \u0093wash sales.\u0094 Distributions of\nshort-term capital gains by an Underlying Fund\nwill be\nrecognized as ordinary income by the Fund and\nwould not be offset by the Fund\u0092s capital loss\ncarryforwards, if any. Capital loss\ncarryforwards of an Underlying Fund, if any,\nwould not offset net capital gains of the\nFund.\n\nTechnology Sector Risk. Technology companies,\nincluding information technology companies,\nmay have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel.\nTechnology companies typically face intense\ncompetition and potentially rapid product\nobsolescence. They are also heavily dependent\non intellectual property rights and may be\nadversely affected by the loss\nor impairment of those rights. Companies in\nthe technology sector may face increased\ngovernment and regulatory scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or regulatory\naction.\n\nUtilities Sector Risk. The utilities sector is\nsubject to significant government regulation\nand oversight. Deregulation,\nhowever, may subject utility companies to\ngreater competition and may reduce their\nprofitability. Companies in the utilities\nsector may be adversely affected due to\nincreases in fuel and operating costs, rising\ncosts of financing capital\nconstruction and the cost of complying with\nU.S. federal and state regulations, among\nother factors.\n\nValuation Risk. The\nprice the Fund or an Underlying Fund could\nreceive upon the sale of a security or other\nasset may differ from the Fund\u0092s or the\nUnderlying Fund\u0092s valuation of the security or\nother asset, particularly for securities or\nother assets that\ntrade in low volume or volatile markets, or\nassets that are impacted by market disruption\nevents or that are valued using a fair value\nmethodology as a result of trade suspensions\nor for other reasons. In addition, the value\nof the securities or\nother assets in the Fund\u0092s or an Underlying\nFund\u0092s portfolio may change on days or during\ntime periods when shareholders will not be\nable to purchase or sell the Fund\u0092s or an\nUnderlying Fund\u0092s shares. Authorized\nParticipants who\npurchase or redeem shares of the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund on days when the Fund or an\nUnderlying Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other instruments may receive\nfewer or more shares, or lower or higher\nredemption proceeds, than they would\nhave received had the securities or other\ninstruments not been fair valued or been\nvalued using a different methodology.

A\ncomplete list of the Target Fund\u0092s and\nAcquiring Fund\u0092s fundamental and non-\nfundamental investment restrictions is located\nin Appendix I. Following completion\nof the Reorganization, the Combined Fund will\nhave the same fundamental and non-fundamental\ninvestment restrictions as the Target Fund and\nthe Acquiring Fund.\n\n- 18 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n2.4 Performance Information\n\nThe Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund each\ncommenced operations on October 17, 2023 and\nhave limited operating histories. The\nAcquiring\nFund is deemed to be the \u0093accounting survivor\u0094\nin connection with the Reorganization. As a\nresult, the Combined Fund will continue the\nperformance history of the Acquiring Fund\nafter the closing of the Reorganization.\nPerformance\ninformation for each Fund since inception\nthrough the period ended January 31, 2024 is\navailable in each Fund\u0092s Semi-Annual Report\nfor the period ending January 31, 2024.\nUpdated performance information, including the\nFunds\u0092\ncurrent NAVs, may be obtained by visiting\nwww.iShares.com or by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) (toll free).\n\n2.5 Management of the Funds\n\nInvestment Adviser. As investment adviser, BFA\nhas overall responsibility for the general\nmanagement and administration of the Funds.\nBFA provides an investment program for each\nFund and manages the investment of each Fund\u0092s\nassets. In managing the Funds, BFA may draw\nupon the research and expertise of its asset\nmanagement affiliates with respect to certain\nportfolio\nsecurities. In seeking to achieve a Fund\u0092s\ninvestment objective, BFA uses teams of\nportfolio managers, investment strategists and\nother investment specialists. This team\napproach brings together many disciplines and\nleverages BFA\u0092s\nextensive resources.\n\nPursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement\nbetween BFA and the Trust (entered into on\nbehalf of the Funds), BFA\nis responsible for substantially all expenses\nof the Funds, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred\nwith respect to the acquisition and\ndisposition of portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio transactions,\nincluding brokerage commissions, distribution\nfees or expenses, and litigation expenses and\nany extraordinary expenses (as determined by a\nmajority of the Trustees who are not\n\u0093interested persons\u0094 of the Trust). Operating\nexpenses paid by\nBFA under the Investment Advisory Agreement\nexclude Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if\nany.\n\nFor its investment advisory services to each\nFund, BFA is paid a management fee from each\nFund based on a percentage of each Fund\u0092s\naverage daily net assets, at the annual rate\nof 0.00%.\n\nBFA may from time to time voluntarily waive\nand/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to\nlimit total annual fund operating expenses\n(excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if\nany). Any such voluntary waiver or\nreimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime.\n\nBFA\nis located at 400 Howard Street, San\nFrancisco, CA 94105. It is an indirect wholly-\nowned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc.\n(\u0093BlackRock\u0094). As of June 30, 2024, BFA and\nits affiliates provided investment advisory\nservices for assets of\napproximately $10.65 trillion. BFA and its\naffiliates trade and invest for their own\naccounts in the actual securities and types of\nsecurities in which the Funds may also invest,\nwhich may affect the price of such securities.\n\nA discussion regarding the basis for the\napproval by the Board of the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement with BFA is available in\neach Fund\u0092s\nSemi-Annual Report for the period ending\nJanuary 31, 2024.\n\nPortfolio Managers. Christopher Chung and\nSuzanne Ly are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Funds. The Portfolio Managers are\nresponsible for various functions related to\nportfolio management, including, but not\nlimited to, investing cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of their respective\nportfolio management team to focus on certain\nasset classes, implementing investment\nstrategy, researching and reviewing investment\nstrategy and overseeing members of\ntheir respective portfolio management teams\nwho have more limited responsibilities.\n\nChristopher Chung has been with BlackRock\nsince 2008,\nincluding his years with Barclays Global\nInvestors. Mr. Chung has been employed by BFA\nor its affiliates as a portfolio manager since\n2008 and has been a Portfolio Manager of the\nFunds since inception (2023).\n\n- 19 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nSuzanne Ly, CFA, FRM has been with BlackRock\nsince 2019. Ms. Ly has been employed by\nBFA or its affiliates as a portfolio manager\nsince 2019 and has been a Portfolio Manager of\nthe Funds since inception (2023).\n\nThe SAI\nprovides additional information about the\nPortfolio Managers compensation, other\naccounts managed by the Portfolio Managers and\nthe Portfolio Managers\u0092 ownership (if any) of\nshares in the Funds.\n\n2.6 Administrator, Custodian and Transfer\nAgent\n\nCitibank serves as administrator, custodian\nand transfer agent for the Funds under the\nMaster Services Agreement (the \u0093Master\nServices\nAgreement\u0094). Citibank\u0092s principal address is\n388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10013.\nPursuant to the Master Services Agreement with\nthe Trust, Citibank provides necessary\nadministrative, tax and accounting and\nfinancial\nreporting services for the maintenance and\noperations of the Trust and each Fund. In\naddition, Citibank makes available the office\nspace, equipment, personnel and facilities\nrequired to provide such services. Pursuant to\nthe Master Services\nAgreement with the Trust, Citibank maintains,\nin separate accounts, cash, securities and\nother assets of the Trust and each Fund, keeps\nall necessary accounts and records and\nprovides other services. Citibank is required,\nupon the order of the\nTrust, to deliver securities held by Citibank\nand to make payments for securities purchased\nby the Trust for each Fund. Citibank is\nauthorized to appoint certain foreign\ncustodians or foreign custody managers for\nFund investments outside the U.S.\nPursuant to the Master Services Agreement with\nthe Trust, Citibank acts as a transfer agent\nfor each Fund\u0092s authorized and issued shares\nof beneficial interest, and as dividend\ndisbursing agent of the Trust. As compensation\nfor these services,\nCitibank receives certain out-of-pocket costs,\ntransaction fees and asset-based fees which\nare accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA from\nits management fee.\n\nJPMorgan serves as custodian for the Funds in\nconnection with certain securities lending\nactivities under a Custody Services Agreement.\nJPMorgan\u0092s principal address is 383 Madison\nAvenue, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10179.\nPursuant to the Custody Services Agreement\nwith BTC and the Trust, JPMorgan provides\ncustody and related services required to\nfacilitate securities lending\nby the Fund. JPMorgan maintains custody as may\nbe necessary to facilitate Fund securities\nlending activity in coordination with other\nfunds, maintains custodial records and\nprovides other services. As compensation for\nthese services, JPMorgan\nreceives certain fees and expenses paid by BTC\nfrom its compensation for its services as\nsecurities lending agent.\n\nThe Master Services\nAgreement and Custody Service Agreement will\nremain in place with respect to the Combined\nFund following the Reorganization.\n\n2.7 Distributor\n\nBlackRock Investments, LLC (\u0093BRIL\u0094 or the\n\u0093Distributor\u0094), 50 Hudson Yards, New York, New\nYork 10001, an affiliate of BFA,\nacts as each Fund\u0092s distributor and will act\nas distributor for the Combined Fund following\nthe closing of the Reorganization.\n\n2.8 Other Service Providers\n\nWillkie Farr & Gallagher LLP serves as each\nFund\u0092s counsel.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP serves as each\nFund\u0092s independent registered public\naccounting firm.\n\nCombined Fund. Following the\nclosing of the Reorganization, the Acquiring\nFund\u0092s current service providers will serve\nthe Combined Fund.\n\n- 20 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n2.9 Dividends and Distributions\n\nGeneral Policies. Dividends from net\ninvestment income, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid at least once a year by each\nFund. Each\nFund generally distributes its net capital\ngains, if any, to shareholders annually.\nDistributions of net realized securities\ngains, if any, generally are declared and paid\nonce a year, but the Trust may make\ndistributions on a more frequent basis\nfor each Fund. The Trust reserves the right to\ndeclare special distributions if, in its\nreasonable discretion, such action is\nnecessary or advisable to preserve its status\nas a RIC or to avoid imposition of income or\nexcise taxes on undistributed\nincome or realized gains.\n\nDividends and other distributions on shares of\neach Fund are distributed on a pro rata basis\nto beneficial\nowners of such shares. Dividend payments are\nmade through DTC (defined below) participants\nand indirect participants to beneficial owners\nthen of record with proceeds received from a\nFund.\n\nDividend Reinvestment Service. No dividend\nreinvestment service is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make available the DTC\nbook-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for\nuse by beneficial owners of a Fund for\nreinvestment of their dividend distributions.\nBeneficial owners should contact their broker\nto determine the availability and costs of the\nservice and the details of\nparticipation therein. Brokers may require\nbeneficial owners to adhere to specific\nprocedures and timetables. If this service is\navailable and used, dividend distributions of\nboth income and realized gains will be\nautomatically reinvested in\nadditional whole shares of a Fund purchased in\nthe secondary market.\n\nEffective upon the closing of the\nReorganization, the Acquiring\nFund\u0092s dividends and distributions policy will\nbe continued by the Combined Fund. Acquiring\nFund Shares received by the Target Fund in the\nReorganization will be valued as of the\nValuation Time (as defined below), after the\ndeclaration and\npayment of dividends and distributions.\n\n2.10 Buying, Selling and Valuation of Shares\n\nShareholders should refer to the Acquiring\nFund\u0092s Prospectus (a copy of which accompanies\nthis Combined Prospectus/Information\nStatement)\nfor the specific procedures applicable to\nbuying, selling and valuation of shares. The\nfollowing discussion describes the policies\nand procedures related to the purchase, sale\nand valuation of shares of the Funds, which\nare identical, and which\npolicies and procedures will be the same for\nthe Combined Fund following the closing of the\nReorganization.\n\nBuying and Selling Shares. Shares of the Funds\nmay be acquired or redeemed directly from a\nFund only in Creation Units or multiples\nthereof, as discussed in the Creations and\nRedemptions section of each Fund\u0092s Prospectus.\nOnly an Authorized Participant may\nengage in creation or redemption transactions\ndirectly with a Fund. Once created, shares of\nthe Funds generally trade in the secondary\nmarket in amounts less than a Creation Unit.\n\nShares of each Fund are listed on a national\nsecurities exchange for trading during the\ntrading day. Shares can be bought and sold\nthroughout\nthe trading day like shares of other publicly\ntraded companies. The Trust does not impose\nany minimum investment for shares of a Fund\npurchased on an exchange or otherwise in the\nsecondary market. The Funds\u0092 shares trade\nunder the ticker\nsymbols listed on the front cover page of this\nProspectus.\n\nBuying or selling Fund shares on an exchange\nor other secondary market\ninvolves two types of costs that may apply to\nall securities transactions. When buying or\nselling shares of the Funds through a broker,\nyou may incur a brokerage commission and other\ncharges. The commission is frequently a fixed\namount and may be a\nsignificant proportional cost for investors\nseeking to buy or sell small amounts of\nshares. In addition, you may incur the cost of\nthe \u0093spread,\u0094 that is, any difference between\nthe bid price and the ask price. The spread\nvaries over time\nfor shares of each Fund based on the Fund\u0092s\ntrading volume and market liquidity, and is\ngenerally lower if the Fund has high trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and higher if the\nFund has little trading volume\n\n- 21 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nand market liquidity (which is often the case\nfor funds that are newly launched or small in\nsize). The Fund\u0092s spread may also be impacted\nby the liquidity or illiquidity of the\nunderlying\nsecurities held by the Fund, particularly for\nnewly launched or smaller funds or in\ninstances of significant volatility of the\nunderlying securities.\n\nThe national securities exchange on which each\nFund\u0092s shares are listed is open for trading\nMonday through Friday and is closed on\nweekends and the following holidays (or the\ndays on which they are observed): New Year\u0092s\nDay, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents\u0092\nDay, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day\nand Christmas\nDay. Each Fund\u0092s primary listing exchange is\nNYSE Arca.\n\nSection 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally\nrestricts investments by\ninvestment companies, including foreign and\nunregistered investment companies, in the\nsecurities of other investment companies. For\nexample, a registered investment company (the\n\u0093Purchased Fund\u0094), such as the Funds, may not\nknowingly sell\nor otherwise dispose of any security issued by\nthe Purchased Fund to any investment company\n(the \u0093Purchasing Fund\u0094) or any company or\ncompanies controlled by the Purchasing Fund\nif, immediately after such sale or\ndisposition: (i) more\nthan 3% of the total outstanding voting stock\nof the Purchased Fund is owned by the\nPurchasing Fund and any company or companies\ncontrolled by the Purchasing Fund, or (ii)\nmore than 10% of the total outstanding voting\nstock of the Purchased\nFund is owned by the Purchasing Fund and other\ninvestment companies and companies controlled\nby them. Although SEC rules may permit\nregistered investment companies and unit\ninvestment trusts (\u0093Investing Funds\u0094) that\nenter into an\ninvestment agreement with the Trust to invest\nin iShares funds beyond the limits set forth\nin Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act subject to\ncertain terms and conditions, the Fund does\nnot permit such investments. Accordingly,\nInvesting Funds must\nadhere to the limits set forth in Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the\nFunds. In addition, foreign investment\ncompanies are permitted to invest in the Funds\nonly up to the limits set forth in Section\n12(d)(1), subject to\nany applicable SEC no-action relief.\n\nBook Entry. Shares of the Funds are held in\nbook-entry form, which means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The Depository Trust\nCompany (\u0093DTC\u0094) or its nominee is the record\nowner of, and holds legal title to, all\noutstanding shares of each Fund.\n\nInvestors owning shares of the Funds are\nbeneficial owners as shown on the records of\nDTC or its participants. DTC serves as the\nsecurities\ndepository for shares of the Funds. DTC\nparticipants include securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and other institutions that\ndirectly or indirectly maintain a custodial\nrelationship with DTC. As a beneficial\nowner of shares, you are not entitled to\nreceive physical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares registered in\nyour name, and you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares. Therefore, to\nexercise any right as an owner of shares, you\nmust rely upon the procedures of DTC and its\nparticipants. These procedures are the same as\nthose that apply to any other securities that\nyou hold in book-entry or \u0093street name\u0094 form.\n\nShare Prices. The trading prices of a Fund\u0092s\nshares in the secondary market generally\ndiffer from the Fund\u0092s daily NAV and\nare affected by market forces such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF shares and shares\nof underlying securities held by the Funds,\neconomic conditions and other factors.\n\nDetermination of Net Asset Value. The NAV of\neach Fund normally is determined once daily\nMonday through Friday, generally as of the\nclose of regular trading hours of the New York\nStock Exchange (\u0093NYSE\u0094) (normally 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern time) on each day that the NYSE is\nopen for trading, based on prices at the time\nof closing, provided that any Fund assets or\nliabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the\nprevailing market rates on the date of\nvaluation as quoted by one or more data\nservice providers. The NAV of each Fund is\ncalculated by dividing the value\nof the net assets of a Fund (i.e., the value\nof its total assets, which includes the values\nof the Underlying Fund shares in which the\nFund invests, less total liabilities) by the\ntotal number of outstanding shares of the\nFund, generally\nrounded to the nearest cent.\n\n- 22 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe value of the securities and other assets\nand liabilities held by each Fund is\ndetermined\npursuant to BFA\u0092s valuation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been designated by the\nBoard as the valuation designee for the Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act.\n\nEquity securities and other equity instruments\nfor which market quotations are readily\navailable are valued at market value, which is\ngenerally determined using the last reported\nofficial closing price or, if a reported\nclosing price is not available, the last\ntraded price on the exchange or market on\nwhich the security or instrument is primarily\ntraded at the time of valuation.\nShares of underlying open-end funds (including\nmoney market funds) are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying exchange-traded\nclosed-end funds or other ETFs are\nvalued at their most recent closing price.\n\nGenerally, trading in non-U.S. securities and\nmoney\nmarket instruments is substantially completed\neach day at various times prior to the close\nof regular trading hours of the NYSE. The\nvalues of such securities used in computing\nthe NAV of the Funds are determined as of such\ntimes.\n\nWhen market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund\u0092s\ninvestments in\naccordance with its policies and procedures.\nBFA may conclude that a market quotation is\nnot readily available or is unreliable if a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its lack of trading\nor other reasons, if a\nmarket quotation differs significantly from\nrecent price quotations or otherwise no longer\nappears to reflect fair value, where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is thinly\ntraded, when there is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation, or if the trading\nmarket on which a security is listed is\nsuspended or closed and no appropriate\nalternative trading market is available. A\n\u0093significant event\u0094 is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its\nreasonable business judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u0092s assets or\nliabilities, that the event is likely to cause\na material change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or\nliabilities of, a Fund.\n\nFair value represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. The fair value of an\nasset or liability held by a Fund is the\namount the Fund might reasonably expect to\nreceive from the current sale of that asset or\nthe cost to extinguish that liability in an\narm\u0092s-length transaction.\nValuing a Fund\u0092s investments using fair value\npricing will result in prices that may differ\nfrom current market valuations and that may\nnot be the prices at which those investments\ncould have been sold during the period in\nwhich the particular\nfair values were used.\n\n2.11 Distribution\n\nThe Distributor or its agent distributes\nCreation Units for each Fund on an agency\nbasis. The Distributor does not maintain a\nsecondary market\nin shares of the Funds. The Distributor has no\nrole in determining the policies of any Fund\nor the securities that are purchased or sold\nby any Fund. The Distributor\u0092s principal\naddress is 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001.\n\nBFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-\ndealers, registered investment advisers, banks\nor other intermediaries (together,\n\u0093intermediaries\u0094) related to marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, data provision services, or\ntheir making shares of the Funds\nand certain other iShares funds available to\ntheir customers generally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such payments, which may\nbe significant to the intermediary, are not\nmade by the Funds. Rather, such payments are\nmade by BFA or its\naffiliates from their own resources, which\ncome directly or indirectly in part from fees\npaid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of\nthis type are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it recommends\nor makes available, or the level of services\nprovided, to its customers based on the\npayments or other financial incentives it is\neligible to receive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial\nincentives offered or made to an intermediary\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nintermediary and its customers and may cause\nthe intermediary to recommend the Funds or\nother iShares funds over another investment.\nMore information regarding\nthese payments is contained in the Funds\u0092 SAI.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments his or her firm\nmay receive from BFA or its affiliates.\n\n- 23 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n2.12 Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings\n\nFor a discussion of each Fund\u0092s policies and\nprocedures regarding the selective disclosure\nof its portfolio holdings, please see the SAI.\n\n2.13 Market Timing Trading Policies and\nProcedures\n\nEach Fund does not impose restrictions on the\nfrequency of purchases and redemptions of Fund\nshares directly with the Fund. The Board\ndetermined not to adopt policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent or monitor for\nfrequent purchases and redemptions of Fund\nshares because each Fund generally sells and\nredeems its shares directly through\ntransactions that are in-kind and/or for cash,\nwith a deadline for placing cash-related\ntransactions no later than the close of the\nprimary markets for the Fund\u0092s portfolio\nsecurities. However, each Fund has taken\ncertain measures\n(e.g., imposing transaction fees on purchases\nand redemptions of Creation Units and\nreserving the right to reject purchases of\nCreation Units under certain circumstances) to\nminimize the potential consequences of\nfrequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized Participants, such\nas increased tracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution to the Fund,\nand/or increased transaction costs. Further,\nthe vast majority of trading in Fund shares\noccurs on the secondary\nmarket, which does not involve each Fund\ndirectly, and such trading is unlikely to\ncause many of the harmful effects of frequent\ncash purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.\n\n- 24 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nARTICLE III FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS The financial\nhighlights table is intended to help investors\nunderstand the Fund\u0092s financial performance\nsince inception.

Agreement does not purport to\nbe complete and is qualified in its entirety\nby reference to the form of Reorganization\nAgreement, a copy of which is attached as\nAppendix II \u0097 \u0093Form of Agreement and Plan of\nReorganization\u0094 and is incorporated herein by\nreference. 4.1 General Under the\nReorganization Agreement, the Reorganization\nwill consist of (i) the transfer of all of the\nassets of the Target Fund to the Acquiring\nFund, in exchange for the assumption by the\nAcquiring Fund of All Liabilities (as defined\nin Appendix II) of the Target Fund and shares\nof the Acquiring Fund (such amount of\nAcquiring Fund shares, the \u0093Acquiring Fund\nShares\u0094) having an aggregate NAV equal to the\nvalue of the assets of the Target Fund\nacquired by the Acquiring Fund reduced by All\nLiabilities; (ii) the distribution, on or as\nsoon as practicable after the Closing Date (as\ndefined in Appendix II), of the Acquiring Fund\nShares and cash in lieu of fractional shares\nto the shareholders of the Target Fund in\nliquidation and redemption of all outstanding\nshares of the Target Fund; and (iii) the\ndissolution of the Target Fund, all upon the\nterms and conditions set forth in the\nReorganization Agreement. The Acquiring Fund\nShares issued to the Target Fund will have an\naggregate NAV equal to the aggregate NAV of\nthe Target Fund\u0092s shares outstanding as of the\nclose of trading on the NYSE on the business\nday immediately prior to the Closing Date of\nthe Reorganization (the \u0093Valuation Time\u0094),\nminus cash paid in lieu of fractional shares\nof the Acquiring Fund. Such NAV will be\ndetermined in accordance with the Acquiring\nFund\u0092s valuation procedures or such other\nvaluation procedures as shall be mutually\nagreed upon by the Target Fund and the\nAcquiring Fund. In order to minimize any\npotential for undesirable federal income and\nexcise tax consequences in connection with the\nReorganization, the Target Fund will\ndistribute on or before the Closing Date all\nof its undistributed net investment income and\nnet capital gains as of such date. The Target\nFund expects to distribute its Acquiring Fund\nShares and cash in lieu of fractional\nAcquiring Fund Shares, if any, to the\nshareholders of the Target Fund promptly after\nthe Closing Date. Upon distribution of such\nshares, all outstanding shares of the Target\nFund will be redeemed as soon as practicable\nafter the Closing Date in accordance with\napplicable state law and organizational\ndocuments of the Target Fund. Thereafter, the\nTarget Fund will be abolished as a series of\nthe Trust under Delaware state law. The Target\nFund and the Acquiring Fund have made certain\nstandard representations and warranties to\neach other regarding capitalization, status\nand conduct of business. Unless waived in\naccordance with the Reorganization Agreement,\nthe obligations of the Acquiring Fund and the\nTarget Fund, respectively, are conditioned\nupon, among other things:\n                                              \n      the SEC shall not have instituted any   \n      proceeding seeking to enjoin the        \n      consummation of the transactions        \n      contemplated by the Reorganization      \n      Agreement under Section\u00a025(c) of the    \n      1940 Act;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      the receipt of all necessary            \n      approvals, consents, registrations and  \n      exemptions under federal, state and     \n      local                                   \n      laws;                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      the effectiveness under applicable law  \n      of the registration statement of which  \n      this Combined                           \n      Prospectus/Information Statement forms  \n      a part and the absence of any stop      \n      orders under the Securities Act of      \n      1933 pertaining thereto;                \n                                              \n                                              \n      the declaration of a dividend by the    \n      Target Fund to distribute all of its    \n      undistributed net investment income     \n      and                                     \n      net capital gains; and                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      the receipt of an opinion of counsel    \n      relating to, among other things, the    \n      tax-free nature of the Reorganization   \n      for U.S. federal income tax purposes.   \n                                              \n- 26 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nThe Reorganization Agreement may be terminated\nor amended by the mutual consent of the Target\nFund and the Acquiring Fund. 4.2 Reasons for\nthe Reorganization The factors considered by\nthe Board with regard to the Reorganization\ninclude, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n                                              \n      the shareholders of the Target Fund     \n      will remain invested in a diversified,  \n      open-end fund that is part of the       \n      LifePath ETFs;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      the investment objective of the Target  \n      Fund is similar to the Acquiring Fund,  \n      although there are certain              \n      differences. The principal investment   \n      risks, strategies and restrictions of   \n      the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund  \n      are substantially similar.

The determinations were made on the\nbasis of the business judgment of each Trustee\nafter consideration of all of the factors\ntaken as a whole, though individual members\nmay have placed different weight on various\nfactors and assigned different degrees of\nmateriality to various conclusions. 4.3\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\nof the Reorganization The following is a\ngeneral summary of the material anticipated\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of the\nReorganization. The discussion is based upon\nthe Code, Treasury regulations, court\ndecisions, published positions of the IRS and\nother applicable authorities, all as in effect\non the date hereof and all of which are\nsubject to change or different interpretations\n(possibly with retroactive effect). The\ndiscussion is limited to U.S. persons that\nhold shares of the Target Fund as capital\nassets for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThis summary does not address all of the U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences that may be\nrelevant to shareholders that are subject to\nspecial treatment under U.S. federal income\ntax laws. No assurance can be given that the\nIRS would not assert, or that a court would\nnot sustain, a position contrary to any of the\ntax aspects described below. Shareholders\nshould consult their own tax advisers as to\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe Reorganization, as well as the effects of\nstate, local and non-U.S.tax laws. It is a\ncondition to the closing of the Reorganization\nthat the Trust, on behalf of each Fund,\nreceive an opinion from Willkie Farr &\nGallagher LLP, tax counsel to the Funds, dated\nas of the Closing Date, that the\nReorganization will be a \u0093reorganization\u0094\nwithin the meaning of Section 368(a) of the\nCode and that the Target Fund and the\nAcquiring Fund each will be a \u0093party to a\nreorganization\u0094 within the meaning of Section\n368(b) of the Code. As a \u0093reorganization\u0094\nwithin the meaning of Section 368(b) of the\nCode, the U.S. federal income tax consequences\nof the Reorganization can be summarized as\nfollows:\n                                              \n      no gain or loss will be recognized by   \n      the Acquiring Fund upon the receipt of  \n      the assets of the Target Fund solely    \n      in exchange for shares of the           \n      Acquiring Fund and the assumption by    \n      the Acquiring Fund of stated            \n      liabilities of the Target Fund;         \n                                              \n                                              \n      no gain or loss will be recognized by   \n      the Target Fund upon the transfer of    \n      the Assets of the Target Fund to the    \n      Acquiring Fund solely in exchange for   \n      shares of the Acquiring Fund and the    \n      assumption by the Acquiring Fund of     \n      the stated liabilities of the Target    \n      Fund or upon the distribution of        \n      shares of the Acquiring Fund to Target  \n      Fund shareholders in exchange           \n      for such shareholders\u0092 shares of the     \n      Target Fund in liquidation of the       \n      Target Fund, except for any gain or     \n      loss that may be required to be         \n      recognized solely as a result of the    \n      close of the Target Fund\u0092s taxable year  \n      due to the                              \n      Reorganization or as a result of the    \n      transfer of any stock in a passive      \n      foreign investment company as defined   \n      in Section\u00a01297(a) of the Code;         \n                                              \n                                              \n      no gain or loss will be recognized by   \n      the Target Fund shareholders upon the   \n      exchange of their Target Fund shares    \n      solely for shares of the Acquiring      \n      Fund pursuant to the Reorganization,    \n      except to the extent that a Target      \n      Fund shareholder receives cash in lieu  \n      of fractional shares of the Acquiring   \n      Fund;                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      the aggregate tax basis of Acquiring    \n      Fund Shares received by each Target     \n      Fund shareholder pursuant to the        \n      Reorganization will be the same as the  \n      aggregate tax basis of the Target Fund  \n      shares exchanged therefor by such       \n      shareholder;                            \n                                              \n- 28 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      the holding period of Acquiring Fund    \n      shares to be received by each Target    \n      Fund shareholder pursuant to the        \n      Reorganization will include the period  \n      during which the Target Fund shares     \n      exchanged therefor were held by such    \n      shareholder, provided such Target Fund  \n      shares are held as capital assets at    \n      the time of the Reorganization;         \n                                              \n                                              \n      the tax basis of the assets acquired    \n      by the Acquiring Fund will be the same  \n      as the tax basis of such assets to      \n      the Target Fund immediately before the  \n      Reorganization, except for certain      \n      adjustments that may be required to be  \n      made solely as a result of the close    \n      of the Target Fund\u0092s taxable year due    \n      to the Reorganization or as a result    \n      of gain recognized                      \n      on the transfer of certain assets of    \n      the Target Fund; and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      the holding period of the assets of     \n      the Target Fund in the hands of the     \n      Acquiring Fund will include the period  \n      during which those assets were held by  \n      the Target Fund, except for any assets  \n      which may be marked to market for U.S.  \n      federal income tax purposes on the      \n      termination of the Target Fund\u0092s         \n      taxable year or on which gain was       \n      recognized upon the                     \n      transfer to the Acquiring Fund.         \n                                              \nThe opinion of Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP\nrelating to the Reorganization will be based\non U.S. federal income tax law in effect on\nthe Closing Date. In rendering the opinion,\nWillkie Farr & Gallagher LLP will also rely\nupon certain representations of the management\nof the Acquiring Fund and the Target Fund and\nassume, among other things, that the\nReorganization will be consummated in\naccordance with the operative documents. The\nopinion will not express an opinion on the tax\neffects to the Target Fund or the Acquiring\nFund of marking to market certain categories\nof assets as of the closing of the taxable\nyear of the Target Fund at the time of the\nReorganization or as a result of the transfer\nof certain types of assets. An opinion of\ncounsel is not binding on the IRS or any\ncourt. The Combined Fund intends to continue\nto be taxed under the rules applicable to\nregulated investment companies as defined in\nSection 851 of the Code, which are the same\nrules currently applicable to the Target Fund\nand its shareholders. Prior to the Closing\nDate, the Target Fund will declare a\ndistribution to its shareholders that,\ntogether with all previous distributions, will\nhave the effect of distributing to its\nshareholders all of its investment company\ntaxable income (computed without regard to the\ndeduction for dividends paid), net tax-\nexemptincome and net realized capital gains,\nif any, through the Closing Date (after\nreduction for any capital loss carryforward).\nA portion of the assets held by the Target\nFund may be sold in connection with the\nReorganization if needed for purposes of the\nTarget Fund\u0092s distribution mentioned in the\nprevious paragraph, and a portion of such\nassets may be required to be marked to market\nas a result of the termination of the Target\nFund\u0092s taxable year or as a result of the\ntransfer of some of the assets in the\nReorganization. The tax impact of any such\nsales (or deemed sales) will depend on the\ndifference between the price at which such\nassets are sold (or deemed sold) and the\nTarget Fund\u0092s basis in such assets. Any\ncapital gains recognized in these sales (or\ndeemed sales) on a net basis will be\ndistributed to the Target Fund\u0092s shareholders\nas capital gain dividends (to the extent of\nnet realized long-term capital gains) and/or\nordinary dividends (to the extent of net\nrealized short-term capital gains) during or\nwith respect to the year of sale (or deemed\nsale) and prior to or on the date of the\nReorganization, and such distributions will be\ntaxable to shareholders of the Target Fund. It\nis not expected that significant capital loss\ncarryforwards will be forfeited as a result of\nthe Reorganization with respect to the\nAcquiring Fund. As of January 31, 2024, the\nTarget Fund did not have any capital loss\ncarryforwards. Shareholders of the Target Fund\nmay sell their shares at any time prior to the\nclosing of the Reorganization. Generally,\nthese are taxable transactions. Shareholders\nmust consult with their own tax advisers\nregarding potential transactions. - 29 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n4.4 Expenses of the Reorganization The total\nestimated expenses of the Reorganization\n(including auditor and legal fees and the\ncosts of preparing and filing the Combined\nProspectus/Information Statement) are\napproximately $175,000.

The capitalizations are likely\nto be different when the Reorganization is\nscheduled to be completed as a result of daily\nshare purchase and sale activity.\n                                              \n                               Pro            \n                               fo\u2026            \n                               Ad\u2026       Pro  \n                                to       fo\u2026  \n           Ta\u2026       Ac\u2026       Ac\u2026       Co\u2026  \n           Fu\u2026       Fu\u2026       Fu\u2026       Fu\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  N\u2026    $  3,\u2026    $  3,\u2026    $     \u0097    $  7,\u2026  \n  A\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026       12\u2026       14\u2026       2,\u2026       26\u2026  \n  O\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  p\u2026    $  28\u2026    $  28\u2026              $  28\u2026  \n  S\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Assumes the Reorganization took place    \n  2  on July\u00a031, 2024.                        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n5.2 Shareholder Information As of July 31,\n2024, the Trustees and officers of the Trust\nas a group owned less than 1% of the shares of\nthe Target Fund.

Under the\nTrust\u0092s organizational documents, each Fund is\nauthorized to issue an unlimited number of\nshares of beneficial interest, with no par\nvalue. With respect to each Fund, shares of\nthe same class within such Fund have equal\ndividend, distribution, liquidation, and\nvoting rights, and fractional shares have\nthose rights proportionately. There are no\npreemptive or appraisal rights in connection\nwith the shares of either the Target Fund or\nthe Acquiring Fund. When issued in accordance\nwith the provisions of their respective\nprospectuses (and, in the case of shares of\nthe Acquiring Fund, issued in connection with\nthe Reorganization), all shares are fully paid\nand non-assessable. - 31 -\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nAPPENDIX I FUNDAMENTAL AND NON-\nFUNDAMENTALINVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS Fundamental\nInvestment Restrictions: Each Fund may not:\n                                              \n      Purchase the securities of issuers      \n      conducting their principal business     \n      activity in the same industry if,       \n      immediately after the purchase and as   \n      a result thereof, the value of a Fund\u0092s  \n      investments in that industry would      \n      equal or exceed 25% of the current      \n      value of a Fund\u0092s total assets,          \n      provided that this restriction does     \n  1.  not limit a                             \n      Fund\u0092s: (i)\u00a0investments in securities    \n      of other investment companies, (ii)\u00a0    \n      investments in securities issued or     \n      guaranteed by the U.S. government, its  \n      agencies or instrumentalities, or       \n      (iii)\u00a0investments in repurchase         \n      agreements                              \n      collateralized by U.S. government       \n      securities.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      Borrow money, except as permitted       \n  2.  under the Investment Company Act of     \n      1940, as amended (the \u0093Investment        \n      Company Act\u0094).                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      Issue senior securities to the extent   \n  3.  such issuance would violate the         \n      Investment Company Act.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Purchase or hold real estate, except    \n      each Fund may purchase and hold         \n      securities or other instruments that    \n      are                                     \n      secured by, or linked to, real estate   \n      or interests therein, securities of     \n  4.  real estate investment trusts,          \n      mortgage-related securities and         \n      securities of issuers engaged in the    \n      real estate business, and each Fund     \n      may purchase and hold real estate as a  \n      result of the ownership of securities   \n      or other instruments.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      Underwrite securities issued by         \n      others, except to the extent that the   \n      sale of portfolio securities by each    \n  5.

With respect to the fundamental\npolicy relating to concentration set forth in\n(1) above, the Investment Company Act does not\ndefine what constitutes \u0093concentration\u0094 in an\nindustry. The SEC staff has taken the position\nthat investment of 25% or more of a fund\u0092s\ntotal assets in one or more issuers conducting\ntheir principal activities in the same\nindustry or group of industries constitutes\nconcentration. It is possible that\ninterpretations of concentration could change\nin the future. The policy in (1) above will be\ninterpreted to refer to concentration as that\nterm may be interpreted from time to time. The\npolicy also will be interpreted to permit\ninvestment without limit in the following:\nsecurities of the U.S. government and its\nagencies or instrumentalities; securities of\nstate, territory, possession or municipal\ngovernments and their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\neach Fund\u0092s industry classifications, each\nFund currently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classificationsused by one or\nmore widely recognized market indexes or\nrating group indexes, and/or as defined by\nFund management. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to give broad authority to each\nFund as to how to classify issuers within or\namong industries . I-1\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nWith respect to the fundamental policy\nrelating to borrowing money set forth in\n(2) above, the Investment Company Act permits\neach Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to\none-third of the Fund\u0092s total assets from\nbanks for any purpose, and to borrow up to 5%\nof the Fund\u0092s\ntotal assets from banks or other lenders for\ntemporary purposes. (Each Fund\u0092s total assets\ninclude the amounts being borrowed.) To limit\nthe risks attendant to borrowing, the\nInvestment Company Act requires each Fund to\nmaintain at all times an\n\u0093asset coverage\u0094 of at least 300% of the\namount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means\nthe ratio that the value of each Fund\u0092s total\nassets (including amounts borrowed), minus\nliabilities other than borrowings, bears to\nthe aggregate\namount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to\nincrease portfolio holdings is known as\n\u0093leveraging.\u0094 Certain trading practices and\ninvestments, such as reverse repurchase\nagreements, may be considered to be borrowings\nor involve leverage and\nthus are subject to the Investment Company Act\nrestrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f- 4\nunder the Investment Company Act, when each\nFund engages in reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing\ntransactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain\nasset coverage of at least 300% with respect\nto such transactions and any other borrowings\nin the aggregate, or (ii) treat such\ntransactions as \u0093derivatives transactions\u0094 and\ncomply\nwith Rule 18f-4 with respect to such\ntransactions. Short-term credits necessary for\nthe settlement of securities transactions and\narrangements with respect to securities\nlending will not be considered to be\nborrowings under the policy. Practices and\ninvestments that may involve leverage but are\nnot considered to be borrowings are not\nsubject to the policy.\n\nWith respect to the fundamental policy\nrelating to underwriting set forth in (5)\nabove, the Investment Company Act does not\nprohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets\nunder certain circumstances. Those\ncircumstances currently are that the amount of\na fund\u0092s underwriting commitments, when added\nto the value of a fund\u0092s investments in\nissuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting\nsecurities of those issuers, cannot exceed the\n25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions\ninvolving the acquisition or disposition of\nportfolio securities may be considered to be\nan underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it\nis not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the business of underwriting, the\npolicy in (5) above will be interpreted not to\nprevent a fund from engaging in transactions\ninvolving the acquisition\nor disposition of portfolio securities,\nregardless of whether a fund may be considered\nto be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is\notherwise engaged in the underwriting business\nto the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nWith respect to the fundamental policy\nrelating to lending set forth in (7) above,\nthe Investment Company Act does not prohibit\neach Fund\nfrom making loans (including lending its\nsecurities); however, SEC staff\ninterpretations currently prohibit funds from\nlending more than one-third of their total\nassets (including lending its securities),\nexcept through the purchase of debt\nobligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as\ndelays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\n\nEach Fund has adopted a non-fundamental\ninvestment policy not to\npurchase securities of other investment\ncompanies, except to the extent permitted by\nthe Investment Company Act. As a matter of\npolicy, however, each Fund will not purchase\nshares of any registered open-end\ninvestment company or registered unit\ninvestment trust, in reliance on Section\n12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the \u0093fund of funds\u0094\nprovisions) of the Investment Company Act, at\nany time each LifePath ETF has knowledge that\nits shares are\npurchased by another investment company\ninvestor in reliance on the provisions of\nsubparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).\n\nEach\nFund has adopted a non-fundamental investment\npolicy not to make short sales of securities\nor maintain a short position, except to the\nextent permitted by each Fund\u0092s Prospectus and\nStatement of\nAdditional Information, as amended from time\nto time, and applicable law.\n\nI-2\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nUnless otherwise indicated, all limitations\nunder each Fund\u0092s fundamental or non-\nfundamental investment policies apply only at\nthe time that a transaction is undertaken. Any\nchange in the percentage of each Fund\u0092s assets\ninvested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from\nmarket fluctuations or other changes in each\nFund\u0092s total assets will not require each Fund\nto dispose of an investment until BFA\ndetermines that it is practicable to sell or\nclose out the investment without undue market\nor tax consequences.\n\nNotwithstanding any other investment policy or\nrestriction (whether or not fundamental), the\nUnderlying Funds in which each Fund may\ninvest have adopted certain investment\nrestrictions that may be different from those\nlisted above, thereby permitting each Fund to\nengage indirectly in investment strategies\nthat are prohibited under the restrictions\nlisted above. The investment\nrestrictions of each Underlying Fund are set\nforth in its respective statement of\nadditional information.\n\nI-3\n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nAPPENDIX II\n\nFORM OF AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION\n\nTHIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the\n\u0093Agreement\u0094) is made as of this [\u0095] day of\n[\u0095], 2024, by and\nbetween iShares Trust, a registered investment\ncompany and a Delaware statutory trust (the\n\u0093Trust\u0094), on behalf of iShares LifePath Target\nDate 2025 ETF, a separate series of the Trust\n(the \u0093Target Fund\u0094), and the Trust, on behalf\nof iShares LifePath Retirement ETF, a separate\nseries of the Trust (the \u0093Acquiring Fund\u0094).\n\nThis Agreement is intended to be,\nand is adopted as, a plan of reorganization\nwithin the meaning of section 368(a) of the\nUnited States Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\nas amended (the \u0093Code\u0094), and the Treasury\nRegulations promulgated thereunder.
