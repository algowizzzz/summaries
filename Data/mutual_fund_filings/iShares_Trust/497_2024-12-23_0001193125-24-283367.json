  "text": "iShares \u00ae\n\niShares Trust, iShares U.S. ETF Trust, and\niShares, Inc.\n\nSupplement dated December 23, 2024\n\nto the currently effective Statement of\nAdditional Information (each, an \u0093SAI\u0094) for\nthe Funds listed in Exhibit 1 hereto (each, a\nFund and collectively, the \u0093Funds\u0094)\n\nThe following changes for the Funds will be\neffective on January 1, 2025.\n                                              \n      The section of each SAI entitled \u0093Proxy  \n  1.  Voting Policy\u0094 shall be deleted in its   \n      entirety and replaced with              \n      the following:                          \n                                              \nThe Board has delegated the voting of proxies\nfor the Funds\u0092 securities to BFA pursuant to\n(i) the Open-End Active and Fixed Income Index\nFund Proxy Voting Policy (the \u0093Active Fund\nProxy Voting Policy\u0094), with respect to certain\nFunds, and (ii) the Index Equity Fund Proxy\nVoting Policy, with respect\nto certain other Funds, as applicable. Please\nrefer to Exhibit 1 of this SAI, which\ndiscloses the policy applicable to each Fund.\nInformation that does not apply to a Fund does\nnot form a part of that Fund\u0092s SAI and should\nnot be relied on by\ninvestors in that Fund. Only information that\nis clearly identified as applicable to a Fund\nis considered to form a part of that Fund\u0092s\nSAI.\n\nWith respect to\nFunds covered by the Active Fund Proxy Voting\nPolicy, BFA has adopted the BlackRock Active\nInvestment Stewardship - Global Engagement and\nVoting Guidelines (the \u0093BAIS Guidelines\u0094).\nCertain of such Funds, as listed within the\nActive Fund\nProxy Voting Policy and as disclosed in\nExhibit 1 of this SAI, follow supplemental\nguidelines within the BAIS Guidelines that are\napplicable to certain climate and\ndecarbonization issues (the \u0093BAIS Climate and\nDecarbonization Stewardship\nGuidelines\u0094).\n\nWith respect to Funds covered by the Index\nEquity Fund Proxy Voting Policy, BFA has\nadopted the BlackRock Investment Stewardship\n(\u0093BIS\u0094) Global Benchmark Policy, comprised of\nthe Global Principles for Benchmark Policies,\nregional voting guidelines, and engagement\npriorities, which are each available upon\nrequest. In addition, certain of such Funds,\nas listed within\nthe Index Equity Fund Proxy Voting Policy and\nas disclosed in Exhibit 1 of this SAI, follow\nsupplemental guidelines that are applicable to\ncertain climate and decarbonization issues\n(the \u0093BIS Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship\nGuidelines\u0094).\n\nIf a Fund invests in an underlying fund\nmanaged by BlackRock, the Fund will use its\nproxy voting policy when voting on proxies for\nthe underlying\nfund while the underlying fund will use its\nproxy voting policy when voting proxies on\ninvestments the underlying fund holds.\nTherefore, the Fund may use the Active Fund\nProxy Voting Policy while an underlying fund\nmay use the Index Equity Fund\nProxy Voting Policy, and the opposite is also\ntrue.\n\nCopies of the Active Fund Proxy Voting Policy,\nIndex Equity Fund Proxy Voting Policy, the\nBAIS Guidelines, the\nGlobal Principles for Benchmark Policies and\nthe BIS Climate and Decarbonization\nStewardship Guidelines are included in Exhibit\n1 of this SAI.\n\nInformation with\nrespect to how proxies relating to the Fund\u0092s\nportfolio securities were voted during the\n12-month period ended June 30 is available:\n(i) without charge, upon request, by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or through the\nFund\u0092s website at\nwww.blackrock.com/proxyrecords; and (ii) on\nthe SEC\u0092s website at www.sec.gov.\n                                              \n      The section of each SAI entitled        \n  2.  \u0093Conflicts of Interest\u0094 shall be deleted  \n      in its entirety and replaced with       \n      the following:                          \n                                              \nConflicts of Interest. Certain activities of\nBlackRock, Inc., BlackRock Advisors, LLC,\nBlackRock Fund Advisors and the\nother subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc.\n(collectively referred to in this section as\n\u0093BlackRock\u0094) and their respective directors,\nofficers or employees, with respect to the\nFunds and/or other accounts managed by\nBlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\n\nBlackRock is one of the world\u0092s largest asset\nmanagement firms.\nBlackRock, its subsidiaries and their\nrespective directors, officers and employees,\nincluding the business units or entities and\npersonnel who may be involved in the\ninvestment activities and business operations\nof a Fund, are engaged\n\nworldwide in businesses, including managing\nequities, fixed income securities, cash and\nalternative investments, and other financial\nservices, and have interests other than that\nof\nmanaging the Funds. These are considerations\nof which investors in a Fund should be aware,\nand which may cause conflicts of interest that\ncould disadvantage a Fund and its\nshareholders. These businesses and interests\ninclude potential\nmultiple advisory, transactional, financial\nand other relationships with, or interests in\ncompanies and interests in securities or other\ninstruments that may be purchased or sold by a\nFund.\n\nBlackRock has proprietary interests in, and\nmay manage or advise with respect to, accounts\nor funds (including separate accounts and\nother funds and collective\ninvestment vehicles) that have investment\nobjectives similar to those of a Fund and/or\nthat engage in transactions in the same types\nof securities, currencies and instruments as\nthe Fund. BlackRock is also a major\nparticipant in the global\ncurrency, equities, swap and fixed income\nmarkets, in each case, for the accounts of\nclients and, in some cases, on a proprietary\nbasis. As such, BlackRock is or may be\nactively engaged in transactions in the same\nsecurities, currencies,\nand instruments in which a Fund invests.\n\nSuch activities could affect the prices and\navailability of the securities, currencies,\nand instruments in which a\nFund invests, which could have an adverse\nimpact on a Fund\u0092s performance. Such\ntransactions, particularly in respect of most\nproprietary accounts or client accounts, will\nbe executed independently of a Fund\u0092s\ntransactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFund. In addition, the portfolio holdings of\ncertain BlackRock-advised investment vehicles\nmanaged in an identical or substantially\nsimilar manner as\ncertain Funds are made publicly available on a\nmore timely basis than the applicable Fund. In\nsome cases, such portfolio holdings are made\npublicly available on a daily basis. While not\nexpected, it is possible that a recipient of\nportfolio holdings information for such an\ninvestment vehicle could cause harm to a Fund\nthat is managed in an identical or\nsubstantially similar manner, including by\ntrading ahead of or against such Fund based on\nthe information received.\n\nWhen BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the\nsame assets for client accounts, including a\nFund, the assets actually purchased or sold\nmay be allocated among\nthe accounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor a Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one\nor more other accounts managed by BlackRock\nmay have the effect of diluting or otherwise\ndisadvantaging the values, prices or\ninvestment strategies of a Fund, particularly,\nbut not limited to, with respect to small\ncapitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding a\nFund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts.\nWhen BlackRock implements a portfolio decision\nor strategy on behalf of another account ahead\nof, or contemporaneously with, similar\ndecisions or strategies for a Fund, market\nimpact, liquidity constraints, or other\nfactors could result in\nthe Fund receiving less favorable trading\nresults and the costs of implementing such\ndecisions or strategies could be increased or\nthe Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged.\nBlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to\nimplement internal\npolicies and procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause a Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so.\n\nConflicts may also arise because portfolio\ndecisions regarding a Fund may benefit other\naccounts managed by BlackRock. For example,\nthe sale of a long position or\nestablishment of a short position by a Fund\nmay impair the price of the same security sold\nshort by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or\nits other accounts or funds, and the purchase\nof a security or covering of a short position\nin a\nsecurity by a Fund may increase the price of\nthe same security held by (and therefore\nbenefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or\nfunds.\n\nBlackRock, on behalf\nof other client accounts, on the one hand, and\na Fund, on the other hand, may invest in or\nextend credit to different parts of the\ncapital structure of a single issuer.\nBlackRock may pursue rights, provide advice or\nengage in other\nactivities, or refrain from pursuing rights,\nproviding advice or engaging in other\nactivities, on behalf of other clients with\nrespect to an issuer in which a Fund has\ninvested, and such actions (or refraining from\naction) may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Fund. In\nsituations in which clients of BlackRock\n(including the Funds) hold positions in\nmultiple parts of the capital structure of an\nissuer, BlackRock may not pursue certain\nactions or remedies that may be\n\navailable to a Fund, as a result of legal and\nregulatory requirements or otherwise.\nBlackRock addresses these and other potential\nconflicts of interest based on the facts and\ncircumstances\nof particular situations. For example,\nBlackRock may determine to rely on information\nbarriers between different business units or\nportfolio management teams. BlackRock may also\ndetermine to rely on the actions of similarly\nsituated\nholders of loans or securities rather than, or\nin connection with, taking such actions itself\non behalf of the Funds.\n\nIn addition, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, certain Funds may invest their\nassets in other funds advised by BlackRock,\nincluding funds that are managed by one or\nmore of the same portfolio managers, which\ncould result in conflicts of interest relating\nto asset\nallocation, timing of Fund purchases and\nredemptions, and increased remuneration and\nprofitability for BlackRock and/or its\npersonnel, including portfolio managers.\n\nIn certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf\nof the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell\nsecurities to another fund or account advised\nby BlackRock. BlackRock may\n(but is not required to) effect purchases and\nsales between BlackRock clients (\u0093cross\ntrades\u0094), including the Funds, if BlackRock\nbelieves such transactions are appropriate\nbased on each party\u0092s investment objectives\nand\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u0092s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the\nFunds. BlackRock may have a potentially\nconflicting division of loyalties and\nresponsibilities to the parties in such\ntransactions.\n\nBlackRock and its clients\nmay pursue or enforce rights with respect to\nan issuer in which a Fund has invested, and\nthose activities may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund. As a result, prices, availability,\nliquidity and terms of the Fund\u0092s investments\nmay be\nnegatively impacted by the activities of\nBlackRock or its clients, and transactions for\nthe Fund may be impaired or effected at prices\nor terms that may be less favorable than would\notherwise have been the case.\n\nThe results of a Fund\u0092s investment activities\nmay differ significantly from the results\nachieved by BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) that it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are\nsubstantially more or less favorable than the\nresults achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is\npossible that a Fund will sustain losses\nduring periods in which one or more\nproprietary or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock achieve\nsignificant profits. The opposite result is\nalso possible.\n\nFrom time to time, a Fund may be restricted\nfrom purchasing or selling securities, or from\nengaging in\nother investment activities because of\nregulatory, legal or contractual requirements\napplicable to BlackRock or other accounts\nmanaged or advised by BlackRock, and/or the\ninternal policies of BlackRock designed to\ncomply with\nsuch requirements. As a result, there may be\nperiods, for example, when BlackRock will not\ninitiate or recommend certain types of\ntransactions in certain securities or\ninstruments with respect to which BlackRock is\nperforming services\nor when position limits have been reached. For\nexample, the investment activities of\nBlackRock for its proprietary accounts and\naccounts under its management may limit the\ninvestment opportunities for a Fund in certain\nemerging and\nother markets in which limitations are imposed\nupon the amount of investment, in the\naggregate or in individual issuers, by\naffiliated foreign investors.\n\nIn\nconnection with its management of a Fund,\nBlackRock may have access to certain\nfundamental analysis and proprietary technical\nmodels developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nnot be under any obligation, however, to\neffect transactions on\nbehalf of a Fund in accordance with such\nanalysis and models. In addition, BlackRock\nwill not have any obligation to make available\nany information regarding its proprietary\nactivities or strategies, or the activities or\nstrategies used\nfor other accounts managed by them, for the\nbenefit of the management of a Fund and it is\nnot anticipated that BlackRock will have\naccess to such information for the purpose of\nmanaging the Fund. The proprietary activities\nor portfolio\nstrategies of BlackRock, or the activities or\nstrategies used for accounts managed by\nBlackRock or other client accounts could\nconflict with the transactions and strategies\nemployed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.\n\nThe Funds may be included in investment models\ndeveloped by BlackRock for use by clients and\nfinancial advisors. To the extent clients\ninvest in these investment\nmodels and increase the assets under\n\nmanagement of the Funds, the investment\nmanagement fee amounts paid by the Funds to\nBlackRock may also increase. The net asset\nvalue and liquidity of a Fund may be impacted\nby purchases\nand sales of the Fund by model-driven\ninvestment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock\nitself and by its advisory clients.\n\nIn addition, certain principals and\ncertain employees of a Fund\u0092s investment\nadviser are also principals or employees of\nother business units or entities within\nBlackRock. As a result, these principals and\nemployees may have obligations to such other\nbusiness units or\nentities or their clients and such obligations\nto other business units or entities or their\nclients may be a consideration of which\ninvestors in a Fund should be aware.\n\nBlackRock may enter into transactions and\ninvest in securities, instruments and\ncurrencies on behalf of a Fund in which\nclients of BlackRock, or, to the extent\npermitted by the Commission and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock, serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty\u0092s interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have\nno incentive to assure that the Fund obtains\nthe best possible prices or terms in\nconnection with the transactions. In addition,\nthe purchase, holding and sale of such\ninvestments by a Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock.\n\nBlackRock may also create, write or issue\nderivatives for clients, the underlying\nsecurities, currencies or instruments of which\nmay be those in which a Fund invests or\nwhich may be based on the performance of the\nFund. Additionally, an affiliate of BlackRock\nwill create, write or issue options, which may\nbe based on the performance of certain Funds.\nBlackRock has entered into an arrangement with\nMarkit Indices\nLimited, the index provider for underlying\nfixed-income indexes used by certain iShares\nETFs, related to derivative fixed-income\nproducts that are based on such iShares ETFs.\nTrading activity in these derivative products\ncould also potentially lead\nto greater liquidity for such products,\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares ETFs and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. A Fund may, subject\nto applicable law, purchase investments that\nare the subject of an\nunderwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse to those\nof the Fund. At times, these activities may\ncause business units\nor entities within BlackRock to give advice to\nclients that may cause these clients to take\nactions adverse to the interests of the Fund.\nTo the extent such transactions are permitted,\na Fund will deal with BlackRock on an arms-\nlength\nbasis.\n\nTo the extent authorized by applicable law,\nBlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent,\nlender or adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities for a Fund.\nIt is anticipated that the commissions, mark-\nups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees,\nunderwriting and placement fees, sales fees,\nfinancing and commitment fees, brokerage fees,\nother fees,\ncompensation or profits, rates, terms and\nconditions charged by BlackRock will be in its\nview commercially reasonable, although\nBlackRock, including its sales personnel, will\nhave an interest in obtaining fees and other\namounts that are\nfavorable to BlackRock and such sales\npersonnel, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Funds. Index based funds may use an index\nprovider that is affiliated with another\nservice provider of the Fund or BlackRock that\nacts as a broker,\ndealer, agent, lender or in other commercial\ncapacities for a Fund or BlackRock.\n\nSubject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its\npersonnel and other distributors)\nwill be entitled to retain fees and other\namounts that they receive in connection with\ntheir service to the Funds as broker, dealer,\nagent, lender, adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities. No accounting to the Funds or\ntheir shareholders\nwill be required, and no fees or other\ncompensation payable by the Funds or their\nshareholders will be reduced by reason of\nreceipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other\namounts.\n\nWhen BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities in\nrelation to the Funds, BlackRock may take\ncommercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Funds. A Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund\u0092s own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its\ncredit to be used in connection with a Fund\u0092s\nestablishment of its business relationships,\nnor is it expected that the Fund\u0092s\ncounterparties will rely on the credit of\nBlackRock in evaluating the Fund\u0092s\ncreditworthiness.\n\nBlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.\n(\u0093BTC\u0094), an affiliate of BlackRock, pursuant\nto SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities\nlending agent to,\nand receives a share of securities lending\nrevenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also\nreceive compensation for managing the\nreinvestment of the cash collateral from\nsecurities lending. There are potential\nconflicts of interests\nin managing a securities lending program,\nincluding but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an\n\nincentive to, among other things, increase or\ndecrease the amount of securities on loan or\nto lend particular securities in order to\ngenerate additional risk-adjusted revenue for\nBlackRock\nand its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto allocate loans to clients that would\nprovide more revenue to BlackRock. As\ndescribed further below, BlackRock seeks to\nmitigate this conflict\nby providing its securities lending clients\nwith equal lending opportunities over time in\norder to approximate pro rata allocation.\n\nAs part of its securities\nlending program, BlackRock indemnifies the\nFunds and certain other clients and/or funds\nagainst a shortfall in collateral in the event\nof borrower default. On a regular basis,\nBlackRock calculates the potential dollar\nexposure of\ncollateral shortfall resulting from a borrower\ndefault (\u0093shortfall risk\u0094) in the securities\nlending program. BlackRock establishes\nprogram-wide borrower limits (\u0093credit limits\u0094)\nto actively manage\nborrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock\noversees the risk model that calculates\nprojected collateral shortfall values using\nloan-level factors such as loan and collateral\ntype and market value as well as specific\nborrower\ncredit characteristics. When necessary,\nBlackRock may adjust securities lending\nprogram attributes by restricting eligible\ncollateral or reducing borrower credit limits.\nAs a result, the management of program-wide\nexposure as well\nas BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset\ntype, collateral type and/or revenue profile).\n\nBlackRock may decline to make a securities\nloan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending\non behalf of a Fund\nor terminate a securities loan on behalf of a\nFund for any reason, including but not limited\nto regulatory requirements and/or market\nrules, liquidity considerations, or credit\nconsiderations, which may impact Funds by\nreducing\nor eliminating the volume of lending\nopportunities for certain types of loans,\nloans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. In addition, some\nborrowers may prefer\ncertain BlackRock lenders that provide\nadditional protections against lender default\nthat are favored by their prudential\nregulation.\n\nBlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits\n(i.e. indemnification exposure limit and\nborrower credit limits); (ii) the lending\nportfolio must hold the asset at the time a\nloan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the\nlending portfolio must also have enough\ninventory, either on its\nown or when aggregated with other portfolios\ninto one single market delivery, to satisfy\nthe loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks\nto provide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies\nthe portfolio. Equal opportunities for lending\nportfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes.\nSpecifically, short and long-term outcomes for\nindividual clients may vary due to asset mix,\nasset/liability spreads on different\nsecurities, and\nthe overall limits imposed by the firm.\n\nPurchases and sales of securities and other\nassets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated\nwith orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if\nportfolio management decisions for different\naccounts are made separately, or if they\ndetermine that bunching or aggregating is not\npracticable or required, or in cases involving\nclient direction.\n\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When\nthis occurs, the various prices may be\naveraged, and the Funds will be charged or\ncredited with the average price. Thus, the\neffect of the aggregation may operate on some\noccasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In\naddition, under\ncertain circumstances, the Funds will not be\ncharged the same commission or commission\nequivalent rates in connection with a bunched\nor aggregated order.\n\nBlackRock does not currently enter into\narrangements to use the Fund\u0092s assets for, or\nparticipate in, soft dollars, although\nBlackRock may receive research that is\nbundled with the trade execution, clearing,\nand/or settlement services provided by a\nparticular broker-dealer. To the extent that\nBlackRock receives research on this basis,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist.\nFor example, the research effectively will be\npaid by client commissions that also will be\nused to pay for the execution, clearing, and\nsettlement services provided by the broker-\ndealer and will not be paid by BlackRock.\n\nSubject to applicable law, BlackRock may\nselect brokers that furnish BlackRock, the\nFunds, other BlackRock client\naccounts or personnel, directly or through\ncorrespondent relationships, with research or\nother appropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock\u0092s view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess\n(including with respect to futures, fixed-\nprice offerings and OTC transactions). Such\nresearch or other services may include, to the\nextent permitted by law, research reports on\ncompanies, industries and securities; economic\nand financial\ndata; financial publications; proxy analysis;\ntrade industry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products.\n\nResearch or other services obtained in this\nmanner may be used in servicing any or all of\nthe Funds and other BlackRock client accounts,\nincluding in connection\nwith BlackRock client accounts other than\nthose that pay commissions to the broker\nrelating to the research or other service\narrangements. Such products and services may\ndisproportionately benefit other BlackRock\nclient accounts relative to the\nFunds based on the amount of brokerage\ncommissions paid by the Funds and such other\nBlackRock client accounts. For example,\nresearch or other services that are paid for\nthrough one client\u0092s commissions may not be\nused in managing that\nclient\u0092s account. In addition, other BlackRock\nclient accounts may receive the benefit,\nincluding disproportionate benefits, of\neconomies of scale or price discounts in\nconnection with products and services that may\nbe provided to the\nFunds and to such other BlackRock client\naccounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses\nsoft dollars, it will not have to pay for\nthose products and services itself.\n\nBlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable\nlaw, may endeavor to execute trades through\nbrokers who, pursuant to such arrangements,\nprovide research or other\nservices in order to ensure the continued\nreceipt of research or other services\nBlackRock believes are useful in its\ninvestment decision-making process. BlackRock\nmay from time to time choose not to engage in\nthe above described\narrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock,\nunless prohibited by applicable law, may also\nenter into commission sharing arrangements\nunder which BlackRock may execute transactions\nthrough a broker-dealer and request that the\nbroker-dealer\nallocate a portion of the commissions or\ncommission credits to another firm that\nprovides research to BlackRock. To the extent\nthat BlackRock engages in commission sharing\narrangements, many of the same conflicts\nrelated to traditional\nsoft dollars may exist.\n\nBlackRock may utilize certain electronic\ncrossing networks (\u0093ECNs\u0094) (including, without\nlimitation, ECNs in which BlackRock\nhas an investment or other interest, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law) in\nexecuting client securities transactions for\ncertain types of securities. These ECNs may\ncharge fees for their services, including\naccess fees and\ntransaction fees. The transaction fees, which\nare similar to commissions or\nmarkups/markdowns, will generally be charged\nto clients and, like commissions and\nmarkups/markdowns, would generally be included\nin the cost of the securities\npurchased. Access fees may be paid by\nBlackRock even though incurred in connection\nwith executing transactions on behalf of\nclients, including the Funds. In certain\ncircumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts\nthat will reduce the access\nfees typically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock\nwill only utilize ECNs consistent with its\nobligation to seek to obtain best execution in\nclient transactions.\n\nBlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is\na member of, Members Exchange (\u0093MEMX\u0094), a\nnewly created U.S. stock exchange.\nTransactions for a Fund may be\nexecuted on MEMX if third party brokers select\nMEMX as the appropriate venue for execution of\norders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf\nof client portfolios. In addition,\ntransactions in ETF shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party\nbrokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue\nfor the execution of such orders.\n\nBlackRock has adopted policies and procedures\ndesigned to prevent conflicts of\ninterest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Funds, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock\u0092s fiduciary\nobligations to its clients.\nNevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy\nvoting policies and procedures, actual proxy\nvoting decisions of BlackRock may have the\neffect of favoring the interests of other\nclients or businesses of other divisions or\nunits of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee \u0093Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures.\u0094\n\nIt is also possible that, from time to time,\nBlackRock and /or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance\nwith applicable law, purchase and hold\n\nshares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund\u0092s assets\nmay enhance investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund\u0092s expense\nratio.\n\nBlackRock reserves the right, subject to\ncompliance with applicable law, to sell into\nthe market or redeem in Creation Units through\nan Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of the Fund acquired for its own\naccounts or the account of a BlackRock\nadvisory client. A large sale or redemption of\nshares of the Fund by BlackRock itself or a\nBlackRock advisory client could\nsignificantly reduce the asset size of the\nFund, which might have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund\u0092s liquidity, investment flexibility,\nportfolio diversification, expense ratio or\nability to comply with the listing\nrequirements for the Fund.\n\nIt is possible that a Fund may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in transactions with,\ncompanies in which BlackRock has significant\ndebt or equity investments or\nother interests. A Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured notes) by\nentities for which BlackRock provides and is\ncompensated for cash management services\nrelating to the proceeds from the sale of such\nissuances. In making\ninvestment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is\nnot permitted to obtain or use material non-\npublic information acquired by any unit of\nBlackRock, in the course of these activities.\nIn addition, from\ntime to time, the activities of BlackRock may\nlimit a Fund\u0092s flexibility in purchases and\nsales of securities. As indicated below,\nBlackRock may engage in transactions with\ncompanies in which BlackRock-advised funds or\nother clients\nof BlackRock have an investment.\n\nBlackRock and its personnel and other\nfinancial service providers may have interests\nin promoting sales of the Funds. With\nrespect to BlackRock and its personnel, the\nremuneration and profitability relating to\nservices to and sales of the Funds or other\nproducts may be greater than remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFunds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or\nother personnel may also benefit from\nincreased amounts of assets under management.\nFees and commissions may also be higher than\nfor other products or services, and the\nremuneration and profitability to BlackRock\nand such personnel\nresulting from transactions on behalf of or\nmanagement of the Funds may be greater than\nthe remuneration and profitability resulting\nfrom other funds or products.\n\nThird parties, including service providers to\nBlackRock or the Fund, may sponsor events\n(including, but not limited to, marketing and\npromotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to the Fund.\n\nBlackRock may provide valuation assistance to\ncertain clients with respect to certain\nsecurities or other investments and the\nvaluation recommendations made for such\nclients\u0092 accounts may differ from the\nvaluations for the same securities or\ninvestments assigned by a Fund\u0092s\npricing vendors, especially if such valuations\nare based on broker-dealer quotes or other\ndata sources unavailable to the Fund\u0092s pricing\nvendors. While BlackRock will generally\ncommunicate its valuation information or\ndeterminations\nto a Fund\u0092s pricing vendors and/or fund\naccountants, there may be instances where the\nFund\u0092s pricing vendors or fund accountants\nassign a different valuation to a security or\nother investment than the valuation for such\nsecurity\nor investment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock.\n\nAs disclosed in more detail in \u0093Determination\nof Net Asset Value\u0094 in this SAI, when\nmarket quotations are not readily available or\nare believed by BlackRock to be unreliable, a\nFund\u0092s investments are valued at fair value by\nBlackRock. BlackRock has been designated as\nthe Fund\u0092s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BlackRock\u0092s Rule 2a-5 Committee\n(the \u00932a-5\nCommittee\u0094), with assistance from other\nBlackRock pricing committees and in accordance\nwith BlackRock\u0092s policies and procedures (the\n\u0093Valuation Procedures\u0094). When determining a\n\u0093fair value price,\u0094 the 2a-5 Committee seeks\nto determine the price that a Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u0092s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what a Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the\nasset or liability to maturity. While fair\nvalue determinations will be based upon all\navailable factors that BlackRock deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BlackRock using\nproprietary or third party valuation models,\nfair value represents only a good faith\napproximation of the value of an asset or\nliability. The fair value of one\n\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere\nused in determining a Fund\u0092s NAV. As a result,\na Fund\u0092s sale or redemption of its shares at\nNAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are\nvalued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value,\nmay\nhave the effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders and\nmay affect the amount of revenue received by\nBlackRock with respect to services for which\nit receives an asset-based fee.\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, a\nFund may invest all or some of its short term\ncash investments in any money market fund or\nsimilarly-managed private\nfund advised or managed by BlackRock. In\nconnection with any such investments, a Fund,\nto the extent permitted by the Investment\nCompany Act, may pay its share of expenses of\na money market fund or other similarly managed\nprivate fund in\nwhich it invests, which may result in a Fund\nbearing some additional expenses.\n\nBlackRock and its directors, officers and\nemployees, may buy and sell securities\nor other investments for their own accounts\nand may have conflicts of interest with\nrespect to investments made on behalf of a\nFund. As a result of differing trading and\ninvestment strategies or constraints,\npositions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees of BlackRock\nthat are the same, different from or made at\ndifferent times than positions taken for the\nFund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund\nwill be adversely affected by this personal\ntrading, the\nFund, BRIL and BlackRock each have adopted a\nCode of Ethics in compliance with Section\n17(j) of the Investment Company Act that\nrestricts securities trading in the personal\naccounts of investment professionals and\nothers who normally\ncome into possession of information regarding\nthe Fund\u0092s portfolio transactions. Each Code\nof Ethics is also available on the EDGAR\nDatabase on the Commission\u0092s Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained,\nafter paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at\npublicinfo@sec.gov.\n\nBlackRock will not purchase securities or\nother\nproperty from, or sell securities or other\nproperty to, a Fund, except that the Fund may\nin accordance with rules or guidance adopted\nunder the Investment Company Act engage in\ntransactions with another Fund or accounts\nthat are affiliated\nwith the Fund as a result of common officers,\ndirectors, or investment advisers or pursuant\nto exemptive orders granted to the Funds\nand/or BlackRock by the Commission. These\ntransactions would be effected in\ncircumstances in which\nBlackRock determined that it would be\nappropriate for the Fund to purchase and\nanother client of BlackRock to sell, or the\nFund to sell and another client of BlackRock\nto purchase, the same security or instrument\non the same day. From time\nto time, the activities of a Fund may be\nrestricted because of regulatory requirements\napplicable to BlackRock and/or BlackRock\u0092s\ninternal policies designed to comply with,\nlimit the applicability of, or otherwise\nrelate to such\nrequirements. A client not advised by\nBlackRock would not be subject to some of\nthose considerations. There may be periods\nwhen BlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice\nin certain securities or instruments issued by\nor related to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management\nservices for a company, BlackRock may be\nprohibited from or limited in purchasing or\nselling securities of that company on behalf\nof a Fund, particularly where such services\nresult in BlackRock obtaining material\nnon-public information about the company\n(e.g., in connection with participation in a\ncreditors\u0092 committee). Similar situations\ncould arise if personnel of BlackRock serve as\ndirectors of\ncompanies the securities of which the Funds\nwish to purchase or sell. However, if\npermitted by applicable law, and where\nconsistent with BlackRock\u0092s policies and\nprocedures (including the necessary\nimplementation of appropriate information\nbarriers), the Funds may purchase securities\nor instruments that are issued by such\ncompanies, are the subject of an advisory or\nrisk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the\nissuer.\n\nBlackRock has adopted and implemented policies\nand procedures that are designed to address\npotential conflicts that arise in connection\nwith the advisory\nservices BlackRock provides to Funds and other\nclients. Certain BlackRock advisory personnel\nmay take views, and make decisions or\nrecommendations, that are different than or\nopposite those of other BlackRock advisory\npersonnel. Certain portfolio\nmanagement teams within BlackRock may make\ndecisions or take (or refrain from taking)\nactions with respect to clients they advise in\na manner different than or adverse to the\ndecisions made or the actions taken (or not\ntaken) by the Funds\u0092\nportfolio management teams. The various\nportfolio management teams may not share\ninformation with each other, including as a\nresult of certain information barriers and\nother policies, and will not have any\nobligation or other duty to do so.\n\nBlackRock has established certain information\nbarriers and other policies to address the\nsharing of information between\ndifferent businesses within BlackRock,\nincluding, effective on or about January 21,\n2025, with respect to personnel responsible\nwith managing portfolios and voting proxies\nwith respect to certain index equity\nportfolios versus those responsible\nfor managing portfolios and voting proxies\nwith respect to all other portfolios. As a\nresult of information barriers, certain units\nof BlackRock generally will not have access,\nor will have limited access, to certain\ninformation and personnel,\nincluding senior personnel, in other units of\nBlackRock, and generally will not manage the\nFunds with the benefit of information\npossessed by such other units. Therefore,\nBlackRock may not be able to review potential\ninvestments for the Funds with\nthe benefit of information held by certain\nareas of BlackRock.\n\nBlackRock may determine to move certain\npersonnel, businesses, or business units from\none side of an\ninformation barrier to the other side of the\ninformation barrier. In connection therewith,\nBlackRock personnel, businesses, and business\nunits that were moved will no longer have\naccess to the information and personnel from\nthe side of the\ninformation barrier from which they were\nmoved. Information obtained in connection with\nsuch changes to information barriers may limit\nor restrict the ability of BlackRock to engage\nin or otherwise effect transactions on behalf\nof the Funds\n(including purchasing or selling securities\nthat BlackRock may otherwise have purchased or\nsold for a client in the absence of a change\nto an information barrier). Information\nbarriers may not have their intended impact\ndue to, for example, changes\nin applicable law or inadvertent crossings of\nthe barriers, and actions by personnel on one\nside of a barrier may impact the potential\nactions of personnel on the other side of a\nbarrier.\n\nAlthough the information barriers are intended\nto allow for independent portfolio management\ndecision-making and proxy voting among certain\nBlackRock businesses, the\ninvestment activities of BlackRock for\nBlackRock clients, as well as BlackRock\u0092s\nproprietary accounts, may nonetheless limit\nthe investment strategies and rights of other\nclients (including the Fund). As BlackRock\u0092s\nassets under\nmanagement increases, BlackRock clients may\nface greater negative impacts due to ownership\nrestrictions and limitations imposed by laws,\nregulations, rules, regulators, or issuers.\nFor example, in certain circumstances where a\nBlackRock client\ninvests in securities issued by companies that\noperate in certain industries (e.g., banking,\ninsurance, and utilities) or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or are\nsubject to regulatory or corporate ownership\nrestrictions (e.g.,\nwith mechanisms such as poison pills in place\nto prevent takeovers), or where a BlackRock\nclient invests in certain futures and\nderivatives, there may be limits on the\naggregate amount invested by BlackRock for its\nclients and BlackRock\u0092s\nproprietary accounts that may not be exceeded\nwithout the grant of a license or other\nregulatory or corporate approval, order,\nconsent, relief, waiver or non-disapproval or,\nif exceeded, may cause\nBlackRock or its clients to be subject to\nenforcement actions, disgorgement of share\nownership or profits, regulatory restrictions,\ncomplex compliance reporting, increased\ncompliance costs or suffer disadvantages or\nbusiness restrictions. In\nlight of certain restrictions, BlackRock may\nalso seek to make indirect investments (e.g.,\nusing derivatives) on behalf of its clients to\nreceive exposure to certain securities in\nexcess of the applicable ownership\nrestrictions and limitations when\nlegally permitted that will expose such\nclients to additional costs and additional\nrisks, including any risks associated with\ninvesting in derivatives. There may be limited\navailability of derivatives that provide\nindirect exposure to an impacted\nsecurity. In addition, BlackRock clients can\nbe subject to more than one ownership\nlimitation depending on each client\u0092s\nholdings, and each ownership limitation can\nimpact multiple securities held by the client.\nCertain clients or shareholders\nmay have their own overlapping obligations to\nmonitor their compliance with ownership\nlimitations across their investments.\n\nIf certain aggregate ownership\nthresholds are reached either through the\nactions of BlackRock or a BlackRock client or\nas a result of corporate actions by the\nissuer, the ability of BlackRock on behalf of\nclients to purchase or dispose of investments,\nor exercise rights\n(including voting) or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by law,\nregulation, rule, or organizational documents\nor otherwise impaired. For example, to meet\nthe requirements of an ownership limitation or\nrestriction, a client may be\nunable to purchase or directly hold a security\nthe client would otherwise purchase or hold.\nThe limitation or restriction may be based on\nthe holdings of other BlackRock clients\ninstead of the specific client being\nrestricted. For index funds, this\nmeans a fund may not be able to track its\nindex as closely as it would if it was not\nsubject to an ownership limitation or\nrestriction because the fund cannot acquire\nthe amount of the impacted security included\nin its index. BlackRock on behalf of\nits clients may limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, utilize indirect investments,\nutilize information barriers, or otherwise\nrestrict, forgo,\n\nor limit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing, or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it\nappropriate in light of potential regulatory\nor other restrictions on ownership or other\nconsequences resulting from reaching\ninvestment thresholds. These types of\nrestrictions could negatively impact a\nclient\u0092s performance or ability to\nmeet its investment objective.\n\nWhen BlackRock or a BlackRock client is\nsubject to an ownership limitation, BlackRock\nmay in its discretion seek permission from the\napplicable issuers or regulators to exceed the\nlimitation. However, there is no guarantee\nthat permission will be granted, or that, once\ngranted, it will not be modified or revoked at\na later date with minimal or no notice. The\nissuer and/or\nregulator may also require that BlackRock on\nbehalf of itself and its clients take or\nrefrain from taking certain actions in\nconnection with the approval, order, consent,\nrelief or non-disapproval, which\nBlackRock may accept if it believes the\nbenefits outweigh the costs and may limit\nBlackRock from taking actions that it\notherwise would take. In those circumstances\nwhere ownership thresholds or limitations must\nbe observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients, taking into\nconsideration benchmark weight and investment\nstrategy. BlackRock may adopt certain controls\ndesigned to prevent the occurrence of a breach\nof any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nlimit additional purchases in such securities\nor, with respect to ETFs, remove such\nsecurities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund. If client holdings of an issuer\nexceed an applicable threshold and BlackRock\nis unable to obtain relief to enable the\ncontinued holding\nof such investments, it may be necessary to\nreduce these positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations and BlackRock or such client may\nbe subject to regulatory actions. In these\ncases, the investments will be sold in a\nmanner that BlackRock\ndeems fair and equitable over time.\n\nOwnership limitations are highly complex. It\nis possible that, despite BlackRock\u0092s intent\nto either comply with or be\ngranted permission to exceed ownership\nlimitations, it may inadvertently breach a\nlimit or violate the corporate or regulatory\napproval, order, consent, relief or non-\ndisapproval that was obtained.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, other ownership\nthresholds may trigger reporting requirements\nto governmental and regulatory authorities,\nand such reports may entail\nthe disclosure of the identity of a client or\nBlackRock\u0092s intended strategy with respect to\nsuch security or asset.\n\nBlackRock may not serve as an\nAuthorized Participant in the creation and\nredemption of iShares ETFs.\n\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has,\nwhen applicable, retained BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (the \u0093Distributor\u0094 or\n\u0093BRIL\u0094), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform\ncertain order processing, Authorized\nParticipant communications, and related\nservices in connection with the issuance and\nredemption of Creation\nUnits of the Fund (\u0093ETF Services\u0094). BRIL will\nretain a portion of the standard transaction\nfee received from Authorized Participants on\neach creation or redemption order from the\nAuthorized Participant for the ETF Services\nprovided.\nBlackRock collaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. (\u0093Citibank\u0094) on\nthe design and development of the ETF Services\nplatform. Citibank may have, or from time to\ntime may develop, additional relationships\nwith BlackRock or\nfunds managed by BFA and its affiliates.\n\nIn order to defray transaction expenses and\nprotect against possible shareholder dilution,\nthe Fund may collect certain\nfees from Authorized Participants in\nconnection with cash substitutions for\ncreation and redemption transactions. While\nBlackRock uses good faith estimates of the\nexpected costs to the Fund in determining the\nrates for fees collected by the Fund\nrelated to creation and redemption activity,\nBlackRock may have incentives to improve Fund\nperformance through the collection of these\nfees. As these charges are based on estimates,\nwhere the charges exceed actual transaction-\nrelated costs and/or\nexpenses incurred by the Fund, Fund\nperformance could improve as a result.\nBlackRock has established processes to oversee\nthe determination of these estimates in an\neffort to mitigate this conflict.\n\nBlackRock may maintain securities indices. To\nthe extent permitted by applicable laws, the\nFunds may seek to license and use such indices\nas part of their\ninvestment strategy. Index based funds that\nseek to track the performance of securities\nindices also may use the name of the index or\nindex provider in the fund name. Index\nproviders, including BlackRock (to the extent\npermitted by\napplicable law), may be paid licensing fees\nfor use of their index or index name. In\ninstances where BlackRock charges a unitary\nmanagement fee, BlackRock may have a financial\nincentive to use a BlackRock index that is\nless costly to\n\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Funds using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot\nobligated to license its indices to a Fund and\nthe Funds are under no obligation to use\nBlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a\nlicense for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with\nBlackRock will be as favorable as those terms\noffered to other licensees.\n\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to a\nFund (e.g., custodians, administrators and\nindex providers) pursuant to which BlackRock\nreceives fee discounts or concessions in\nrecognition of BlackRock\u0092s overall\nrelationship with such service providers.\nBlackRock may also enter\ninto contractual arrangements with such\nservice providers pursuant to which BlackRock\nincurs additional costs if the service\nprovider\u0092s services are terminated with\nrespect to a Fund. To the extent that\nBlackRock is responsible for\npaying service providers out of its fees that\nit receives from the Funds, the benefits of\nlower fees, including any fee discounts or\nconcessions, or any additional savings, may\naccrue, in whole or in part, to BlackRock,\nwhich could\nresult in conflicts of interest relating to\nthe use or termination of service providers to\na Fund. In addition, conflicts of interest may\narise with respect to contractual arrangements\nwith third-party service providers to a Fund,\nor the\nselection of such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures.\n\nConflicts of interest may arise as a result of\nsimultaneous investment management of multiple\nclient accounts by the BlackRock\u0092s investment\nprofessionals. For\nexample, differences in the advisory fee\nstructure may create the appearance of actual\nor potential conflicts of interest because\nsuch differences could create pecuniary\nincentives for BlackRock to favor one client\naccount over another.\n\nBlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in\ncertain trading, portfolio management,\noperations and/or information systems used by\nFund service providers.\nThese systems are, or will be, used by a Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Funds, that engage\nthe service\nprovider (typically the custodian). A Fund\u0092s\nservice provider remunerates BlackRock for the\nuse of the systems. A Fund service provider\u0092s\npayments to BlackRock for the use of these\nsystems may enhance the profitability of\nBlackRock.\n\nBlackRock\u0092s receipt of fees from a service\nprovider in connection with the use of systems\nprovided by BlackRock may create an incentive\nfor\nBlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into\nor renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider.\n\nIn recognition of a BlackRock client\u0092s overall\nrelationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may\noffer special pricing arrangements for certain\nservices provided by BlackRock. Any such\nspecial pricing arrangements will not affect\nFund fees and expenses applicable to such\nclient\u0092s\ninvestment in a Fund.\n\nPresent and future activities of BlackRock and\nits directors, officers and employees, in\naddition to those described in this section,\nmay\ngive rise to additional conflicts of interest.\n\niShares is a registered trademark of BlackRock\nFund

Fund\nProxy Voting Policy.\n\nPolicy / Document Requirements and Statements\n\nThe Boards of Trustees/Directors (\u0093Directors\u0094)\nof certain open-end funds (the \u0093Funds\u0094)\nadvised by BlackRock\nFund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors, LLC\n(\u0093BlackRock\u0094), have the responsibility for the\noversight of voting proxies relating to\nportfolio securities of the Funds, and have\ndetermined that it is in the best interests of\nthe Funds and their\nshareholders to delegate the responsibility to\nvote proxies to BlackRock, subject to the\nprinciples outlined in this Policy, as part of\nBlackRock\u0092s authority to manage, acquire and\ndispose of account assets, all as contemplated\nby the\nFunds\u0092 respective investment management\nagreements.\n\nBlackRock has adopted the BlackRock Active\nInvestment Stewardship Global Engagement and\nVoting Guidelines\n(as from time to time amended, the\n\u0093Guidelines\u0094) governing proxy voting by active\nand fixed income index Funds managed by\nBlackRock. The Guidelines include \u0093climate and\ndecarbonization\u0094 guidelines which apply to the\nFunds listed\nin Appendix A, if any.\n\nBlackRock will cast votes on behalf of each of\nthe Funds covered by this policy on specific\nproxy issues in respect of securities held by\neach such Fund (or may refrain from voting) in\naccordance with the Guidelines.\n\nConflicts Management\n\nBlackRock Active Investment Stewardship\n(\u0093BAIS\u0094) maintains policies and procedures\nthat seek to prevent undue influence on\nBlackRock\u0092s proxy voting\nactivity and to mitigate material conflicts of\ninterest in the exercise of proxy voting\nresponsibilities. Potential material\nconflicts, and the resultant potential for\nundue influence, might be due to a\nrelationship between the investee company (or\nany shareholder proponent or dissident\nshareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock\u0092s\naffiliates or employees, or a Fund or a Fund\u0092s\naffiliates. BlackRock has taken certain steps\nto mitigate potential conflicts, which are\noutlined in detail in\nthe Guidelines. In mitigating conflicts, BAIS\nwill adhere to the Guidelines.\n\nIn certain instances, BAIS will engage an\nindependent third-party voting service\nprovider to make\n\nproxy voting recommendations as a further\nsafeguard to avoid potential conflicts of\ninterest, to satisfy regulatory compliance\nrequirements, or as\nmay be otherwise required by applicable law.\n                         \n  Public    Page\u00a01\u00a0of\u00a03  \n                         \nOpen-End Active and Fixed Income Index Fund\nProxy Voting Policy\n\nWith respect to the relationship between\nsecurities lending and proxy voting, shares on\nloan cannot be voted and\nBlackRock may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by BlackRock\u0092s fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in clients\u0092 financial\ninterests.

The\nguidance informs BAIS\u0092 voting recommendations\nto BlackRock\u0092s active portfolio managers. It\napplies to active equity holdings in\nBlackRock\u0092s fundamental equity, systematic\nequity and multi-asset solutions strategies.\nIt also may apply\nto holdings in BlackRock\u0092s index and active\nfixed income strategies, to the extent those\nstrategies hold voting securities or conduct\nissuer engagements. The guidelines are not\nprescriptive as active portfolio managers have\ndiscretion as to how\nthey integrate these guidelines within their\ninvestment processes in light of their\nclients\u0092 or funds\u0092 investment objectives.\nThere are separate, independently developed\nprinciples and voting policies that are\napplied to BlackRock\u0092s\nindex equity investments by a distinct and\nindependent function, BlackRock Investment\nStewardship.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u20093       \n                                              \nIntroduction to BlackRock\n\nBlackRock\u0092s purpose is to help more and more\npeople experience financial well-being. We\nmanage assets on behalf of institutional and\nindividual clients, across a\nfull spectrum of investment strategies, asset\nclasses, and regions. Our client base includes\npension plans, endowments, foundations,\ncharities, official institutions, insurers,\nand other financial institutions, as well as\nindividuals around the\nworld.\n\nAbout BlackRock Active Investment Stewardship\n\nBlackRock Active\nInvestment Stewardship (BAIS) is a specialist\nteam within the Portfolio Management Group and\nmanages BlackRock\u0092s stewardship engagement and\nvoting on behalf of clients invested in active\nstrategies globally. BAIS is also responsible\nfor\nengagement with issuers in index fixed income\nstrategies, where appropriate. Our activities\nare informed by these Global Engagement and\nVoting Guidelines (\u0093the Guidelines\u0094) and\ninsights from active investment analysts and\nportfolio\nmanagers, with whom we work closely in\nengaging companies and voting at shareholder\nmeetings.\n\nEngagement with public companies is the\nfoundation of our approach to\nstewardship within fundamental active\ninvesting. Through direct dialogue with\ncompany leadership, we seek to understand\ntheir businesses and how they manage risks and\nopportunities to deliver durable, risk\nadjusted financial returns. Generally,\nportfolio managers and stewardship specialists\nengage jointly on substantive matters. Our\ndiscussions focus on topics relevant to a\ncompany\u0092s success over time including\ngovernance and leadership, corporate strategy,\ncapital structure and\nfinancial performance, operations and\nsustainability-related risks, as well as\nmacro-economic, geopolitical and sector\ndynamics. We aim to be constructive investors\nand are generally supportive of management\nteams that have a track record of\nfinancial value creation. We aim to build and\nmaintain strong relationships with company\nleadership based on open dialogue and mutual\nrespect.\n\nDifferent active\nequity strategies may implement these voting\nguidelines differently, as a result of the\nlatitude the portfolio manager has to make\nindependent voting decisions aligned with\ntheir portfolio objectives and investment\nstrategy. For example, BAIS will\ngenerally vote the holdings in Systematic\nActive Equity portfolios in accordance with\nthese guidelines. We provide voting\nrecommendations to fundamental equity\nportfolio managers, who may determine to vote\ndifferently based on their portfolio\ninvestment objectives and strategy.\n\nThese guidelines discuss corporate governance\ntopics on which we may engage with management\nteams and board directors and matters that\nroutinely come to a shareholder vote. We\nrecognize that accepted corporate governance\nnorms can differ across markets, and believe\nthese guidelines represent globally applicable\nelements of governance that support a\ncompany\u0092s ability to manage material risks and\nopportunities and deliver financial returns to\ninvestors. Generally, we believe companies\nshould observe accepted corporate governance\nnorms within their local\nmarkets or, particularly in markets without\nwell-established norms, aspire to widely\nrecognized international best practices. As\none of many minority shareholders, BlackRock\ncannot \u0096 and does not try to \u0096 direct a\ncompany\u0092s strategy\nor its implementation. We look to companies to\nprovide disclosures that explain how their\napproach to corporate governance best aligns\nwith the financial interests of their\ninvestors.\n\nOur approach to stewardship within active\nequities\n\nAs shareholders of public\ncompanies, BlackRock\u0092s clients have certain\nfundamental rights, including the right to\nvote on proposals put forth by a company\u0092s\nmanagement or its shareholders. The voting\nrights attached to these clients\u0092 holdings are\nan important\nmechanism for investors to express support\nfor, or concern about, a company\u0092s\nperformance. As a fiduciary, BlackRock is\nlegally required to make proxy voting\ndeterminations, on behalf of clients who have\ndelegated voting authority to us, in a\nmanner that is consistent with their\ninvestment objectives.\n\nReferences to the board, board directors or\nnon-executive directors should\nbe understood to include supervisory boards\nand their members, where relevant.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u20094       \n                                              \nIn general, we tend to support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. As indicated below, we may\nvote against management recommendations when\nwe have concerns about how companies are\nserving the financial interests of our clients\nas their shareholders. We take a globally\nconsistent approach to voting but consider the\ndifferent corporate\ngovernance regulations and norms in various\nmarkets. Votes are determined on a case-by-\ncase basis, in the context of a company\u0092s\nsituation and the investment\nmandate we have from clients. Please see page\n16 for more information about how we fulfil\nand oversee BlackRock\u0092s non-index equity\ninvestment stewardship responsibilities.\n\nOur approach to stewardship within fixed\nincome\n\nAlthough fixed income\ninvestors do not have the right to vote at\nshareholder meetings, issuer engagement is a\ncomponent of fixed income investment\nstrategies at BlackRock, particularly those\nwith sustainability objectives in addition to\nfinancial objectives. Most\ncorporate governance-related fixed income\nengagements are undertaken in conjunction with\nthe active investment stewardship team, and\noften active equity investors. In addition to\nthe topics listed below, engagement with fixed\nincome investment teams\ncan help inform an issuer\u0092s approach to\nstructuring specialist issuances, such as\ngreen bonds, and the standard terms and\ninformation in bond documentation.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u20095       \n                                              \nBoards of Directors\n\nRoles and responsibilities\n\nThere is widespread consensus that the\nfoundation of good corporate governance is an\neffective board of directors that is able to\nadvise\nand supervise management in an independent and\nobjective manner.\n\nWe look to the board of directors (hereafter\n\u0091the board\u0092) to have an oversight role in the\nestablishment and realization of a company\u0092s\nstrategy, purpose and culture. These\nconstructs are interdependent and, when\naligned, can better position a company to be\nresilient in the face\nof a changing business environment, help\nreduce the risks of corporate or employee\nmisconduct, and attract and retain the caliber\nof workers necessary to deliver financial\nperformance over time.\n\nIn promoting the success of the company, the\nboard ensures the necessary resources,\npolicies and procedures are in place to help\nmanagement meet its strategic\nobjectives within an agreed risk tolerance.\n\nOne of the most important responsibilities of\nthe board is to appoint, and remove as\nnecessary, the chief executive\nofficer (CEO). In addition, the board plays a\nmeaningful role in monitoring the performance\nof the CEO and other key executives,\ndetermining executive compensation, ensuring a\nrigorous audit, overseeing strategy execution\nand risk management and\nengaging with shareholders, and other\nstakeholders, as necessary.\n\nComposition and effectiveness\n\nAppointment process\n\nA formal and transparent process for\nidentifying and appointing director candidates\nis critical to ensuring the board is composed\nof directors with the appropriate mix of\nskills and experience. The board or a sub-\ncommittee should determine the\ngeneral criteria given the company\u0092s\ncircumstances (e.g., sector, maturity,\ngeographic footprint) and any additional\ncriteria for a specific role being filled\n(e.g., financial expertise, industry track\nrecord). To inform the process, we\nencourage companies to review the skills and\nexperience of incumbent directors to identify\nany gaps and whether a director candidate\u0092s\ncharacteristics would be additive. We welcome\ndisclosures that explain how the board\nconsidered different\nskills, backgrounds and experience to ensure\nthe directors collectively can be effective in\nfulfilling their responsibilities. We assess a\ncompany\u0092s board composition against that of\nits peer group and local market requirements.\n\nShareholders periodically vote to elect,\nremove and nominate directors to serve on the\nboard. We may vote against the election of the\nmost senior independent director,\nor the chair of the relevant committee, where\na company has not demonstrated it has an\nappointment process that results in a high\nfunctioning board with the appropriate\ncomplement of skills, backgrounds and\nexperience amongst the directors to\nsupport strong financial performance over\ntime. We may vote against newly nominated\ndirectors who do not seem to have the\nappropriate skills or experience to contribute\nto the board\u0092s effectiveness.\n\nIndependence\n\nDirector independence from management,\nsignificant shareholders or other stakeholders\n(e.g., government or employees) is of\nparamount importance to the protection of the\ninterests of minority shareholders such as\nBlackRock\u0092s clients. At least half of the\ndirectors should be\nindependent and free from conflicts of\ninterest or undue influence. This ensures\nsufficient independent directors to have\nappropriately independent board committees.\nCompanies domiciled in\nmarkets with a higher threshold for board\nindependence should meet those requirements.\n\nSee the Corporate Governance Codes of , , and\nthe , as well as the corporate\ngovernance principles of the US as examples.\n\nCommon impediments to independence may\ninclude but are not limited to: current or\nrecent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary; being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company; interlocking directorships;\nlengthy tenure, and having any other\ninterest, business, or other relationship\nwhich could, or could reasonably be perceived\nto, materially interfere with a director\u0092s\nability to act in the best interests of the\ncompany and shareholders.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u20096       \n                                              \nWe may vote against the election of non-\nindependent directors if the board does not\nhave a sufficient balance of independence. We\nmay also vote against the election of the\nchair of the committee responsible for board\ncomposition if this is a perennial issue.\n\nIndependent board leadership\n\nPractices across markets differ,\nas do board structures, but we observe two\nmain approaches to independent board\nleadership. One is a non-executive,\nindependent chair of the board who is\nresponsible for leading the board in the\neffective\nexercise of its duties. The other is a lead or\nsenior independent director, who is\nresponsible for coordinating with the other\nnon-executive directors and working closely\nwith the executive chair on the board\nagenda and other board procedures. In this\ncase, the executive chair and the lead\nindependent director work together to ensure\nthe board is effectively fulfilling its\nresponsibilities. In our view, the independent\nleader of the board, and/or the\nchair of a relevant committee, should be\navailable to investors to discuss board\ngovernance matters such as CEO succession,\nexecutive pay, and board performance. We look\nto boards to explain their independent board\nleadership model and how it serves\nthe interests of shareholders.\n\nWe may vote against the election of the chair\nof the committee responsible for board\ncomposition if there is not an identified\nindependent leader of the board with clear\nresponsibilities for board performance. We may\nvote against the most senior independent\ndirector if the board has a policy of not\nengaging with shareholders.\n\nTenure and succession\n\nBoards should establish the length of\ntime a director would normally be expected to\nserve, in line with market norms where those\nexist. In such markets, we find it helpful\nwhen companies disclose their approach to\ndirector tenure particularly around the\ncontributions of directors who\nhave served for longer periods than provided\nfor in local practices. In our experience,\nlong-serving directors could become less\nindependent given their relationship with\nmanagement and involvement in past board\ndecisions.\n\nSuccession planning for board roles helps\nachieve the appropriate cadence of turnover\nthat balances renewal through the regular\nintroduction of directors with fresh\nperspectives and expertise with continuity\nthrough the retention of directors with long-\nterm knowledge of the board and company.\n\nIn markets where there is not\nspecific director tenure guidance, we may vote\nagainst the election of the chair of the\ncommittee responsible for board composition if\nthere is not a clearly disclosed approach to\ndirector tenure and board renewal. We may vote\nagainst the election\nof directors who have served for longer\nduration than typical in markets with specific\nguidance, where the case for their continued\nservice is not evident.\n\nCapacity\n\nTo be effective and engaged, directors must\ncommit\nappropriate time and energy to the role. A\nboard should assess the ability of its members\nto maintain an appropriate focus on board\nmatters and the company taking into\nconsideration competing responsibilities. We\nrecognize that board leadership\nroles vary across markets in responsibilities\nand required time commitment but note that\nthey are generally more intensive than a\nstandard directorship. We will take local\nnorms and practices into consideration when\nmaking our voting determinations\nacross markets.\n\nWe may vote against the election of directors\nwho do not seem to have sufficient capacity to\neffectively fulfil their duties to the board\nand\ncompany.\n\nDirector elections\n\nIn support of director\naccountability to shareholders, directors\nshould stand for election on a regular basis,\nideally annually. A classified board structure\nmay be justified by a company when it needs\nconsistency and stability during a time of\ntransition, or on the basis\nof its business model, e.g., a non-operating\ncompany such as closed-end funds.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u20097       \n                                              \nShareholders should have the opportunity to\nevaluate nominated directors individually\nrather than in bundled slates. We\nlook to companies to provide sufficient\ninformation on each director standing for\nelection so that shareholders can assess their\ncapabilities and suitability. We will not\nsupport the election of directors whose names\nand biographical details have\nnot been disclosed sufficiently in advance of\nthe shareholder meeting.\n\nEach director\u0092s appointment should be\ndependent on receiving a simple majority of\nthe\nvotes cast at the shareholder meeting. Where a\ncompany\u0092s practices differ, we look to the\nboard to provide a detailed explanation as to\nhow its approach best serves investors\u0092\ninterests.\n\nWe may vote for shareholder or management\nproposals seeking to establish annual election\nof directors and/or a simple majority vote\nstandard for director elections. We\nmay vote against all the directors standing\nfor election as part of a single slate if we\nhave concerns about the profile or performance\nof an individual director.\n\nCommittees\n\nMany boards establish committees to focus on\nspecific responsibilities of the board such as\naudit and risk, governance and human capital,\nand executive compensation, amongst other\nmatters. We do not prescribe to companies what\ncommittees they should establish but we seek\nto understand the\nboard\u0092s rationale for the committee structure\nit determines is appropriate. We note that, in\nsome markets, regulation requires such\ncommittees. The responsibilities of each\ncommittee should be clear, and the board\nshould ensure that all\ncritical matters are assigned either to the\nfull board or to one of the committees. The\nboard should disclose to shareholders the\nstructure, membership, proportion of\nindependent directors, and responsibilities of\neach committee. The\nresponsibilities we typically see assigned to\nthe three most common committees include:\n                                              \n       Audit and risk \u0096 oversight              \n       responsibilities for the integrity of  \n       financial reporting, risk management   \n       and compliance                         \n  \u00b7    with legal and regulatory              \n       requirements; may also play an         \n       oversight role in relation to the      \n       internal audit function and            \n       whistleblowing mechanisms.             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Nominating, governance and human       \n       capital \u0096 ensures appropriate           \n       corporate governance principles and    \n       practices including                    \n       the periodic review of board           \n       performance; responsible for           \n  \u00b7    succession planning for CEO and key    \n       board roles, as well as the director   \n       appointment process; may also have     \n       oversight responsibilities for human   \n       capital management strategies          \n       including                              \n       corporate culture and purpose.         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Executive compensation \u0096 determines     \n       the compensation policies and          \n       programs for the CEO and other         \n  \u00b7    executive officers,                    \n       approves annual awards and payments    \n       under the policies; may also have      \n       oversight responsibilities for         \n       firm-wide compensation policies.       \n                                              \nWe may vote\nagainst the election of the chair of the\ncommittee or other directors serving as\ncommittee members to convey our concerns and\nprovide feedback on how a committee has\nundertaken its responsibilities. We may vote\nagainst the election of the most\nsenior non-executive director if there is not\na clearly disclosed approach to board\ncommittees.\n\nBoard and director evaluation\n\nWe consider it best practice for companies to\nconduct an annual review of the performance of\nthe board, the committees, the chair and\nindividual directors. Periodically, this\nreview could be undertaken by an independent\nthird party able to bring objective\nperspectives to the board on governance and\nperformance. We encourage companies to\ndisclose their approach to and objectives of\nevaluations, including any changes made to the\nboard\u0092s approach as a result.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u20098       \n                                              \nAccess to independent advice\n\nTo support the directors in effectively\nfulfilling their duties to the company and\nshareholders, they should have access to\nindependent advice. When circumstances\nwarrant, boards should be able to retain\nindependent third parties to advise on\ncritical matters. These might include new\nindustry developments such as emergent and\ndisruptive technology, operating events with\nmaterial consequences for the\ncompany\u0092s reputation and/or performance, or\nsignificant transactions. Board committees may\nsimilarly retain third parties to advise them\non specialist matters such as audit,\ncompensation and succession planning.\n\nExecutive compensation\n\nBoards should establish compensation\narrangements\nthat enable the company to recruit, retain and\nreward the caliber of executive management\nnecessary to lead and operate the company to\ndeliver superior financial returns over time.\nWe focus on alignment between variable pay and\na company\u0092s\nfinancial performance.\n\nGenerally, executive compensation arrangements\nhave four components: base salary, annual\nbonus that rewards performance against short-\nterm\nmetrics, share-based incentives that reward\nperformance against long-term metrics, and\npensions and benefits. In our observation,\nbase salary, pensions and benefits are largely\nset relative to market norms and benchmarks.\nThe annual bonus and\nshare-based incentive, or variable pay plans,\ntend to be tailored to the company, its sector\nand long-term strategy, as well as the\nindividuals the board is seeking to recruit\nand motivate.\n\nRecognizing the unique circumstances of each\ncompany, we determine whether to support a\ncompany\u0092s approach to executive compensation\non a case-by-case basis. We rely on companies\nproviding sufficient quantitative and\nqualitative information in their disclosures\nto enable shareholders to understand the\ncompensation arrangements and assess the\nalignment with investors\u0092 interests.

When there is\nnot an alternative, or where there have been\nmulti-year issues with compensation misaligned\nwith performance, we may\nvote against the election of the chair of the\nresponsible committee, or the most senior\nindependent director.\n\nNon-executivedirector compensation\n\nCompanies generally pay non-executive\ndirectors an annual retainer or fee in cash,\nshares or a combination of the two. Some\ncompanies also pay additional fees for service\non board committees or in board leadership\nroles. We do not support non-executive\ndirectors participating in performance-based\nincentive plans as doing so may\ncreate a conflict of interest and undermine\ntheir independence from management, whom they\noversee.\n\nCapital structure\n\nBoards are responsible for ensuring senior\nexecutive leadership has established a capital\nstrategy that achieves appropriate capital\nallocation and management in support\nof long-term financial resilience.\n\nWhere company practices diverge from those set\nout below, we look for companies to disclose\nwhy they view these practices to be\naligned with shareholders\u0092 interests. We may\nvote against management proposals seeking\ncapital-related authorities or the election of\nthe most senior independent director if we\nhave concerns about a company\u0092s approach. We\nmay also support\na shareholder proposal seeking conversion of\nshares with differentiated voting rights to a\none-share, one-vote standard.\n\nShareissuance\n\nWe assess requests for share issuance\nfor particular transactions on a case-by-case\nbasis. We will generally support authorities\nto issue shares when subject to\npre-emptive rights, and up to 20% absent pre-\nemptive rights. Companies should seek regular\napproval of these authorities to allow\nshareholders to take into consideration\nhow prior authorities were used, as well as\nthe current circumstances of the company and\nthe market environment.\n\nShare buybacks\n\nWe assess share buyback proposals in the\ncontext of the company\u0092s disclosed capital\nmanagement strategy and management\u0092s\ndetermination of the appropriate\nbalance between investment that supports the\nlong-term growth of the company and returning\ncash to investors. We also take into\nconsideration the effect of a buyback program\non the company\u0092s balance sheet and executive\ncompensation arrangements\nand the price at which shares are repurchased\nrelative to market price. Companies should\nseek regular approval of these authorities to\nallow shareholders to take into consideration\nhow prior authorities were used, as well as\nthe current\ncircumstances of the company and the market\nenvironment.\n\nWe would normally expect companies to cancel\nrepurchased shares. If a company plans to\nretain them as\ntreasury shares, management should provide a\ndetailed rationale in the context of the\ndisclosed capital management strategy.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u200910      \n                                              \nDividends\n\nWe generally defer to\nmanagement and the board on dividend policy\nbut may engage to seek further clarification\nwhere a proposed dividend appears out of line\nwith the company\u0092s financial position.\n\nDifferentiated voting rights\n\nWe prefer companies to adopt a one-share, one-\nvote structure for share classes with the same\neconomic exposure. Certain companies,\nparticularly those new to public markets,\ncould make the case to adopt a\ndifferentiated voting rights structure, or\ndual class stock. In those situations, we\nencourage companies to evaluate and seek\napproval for their capital structure on a\nperiodic basis.\n\nTransactions and special situations\n\nWe monitor developments in transactions\nand special situations closely and undertake\nour own detailed analyses of proposals.\n\nMergers and acquisitions\n\nWe evaluate proposed mergers or acquisitions\nby assessing the financial outcome for our\nclients as minority shareholders. Management\nshould provide an assessment of the\nproposed transaction\u0092s strategic and financial\nrationale, along with its execution and\noperational risks. We review each transaction\nindependently based on these factors and the\ndegree to which the transaction enhances\nshareholder value. The\nboard should consider establishing an ad hoc\ntransaction committee to undertake an\nindependent assessment of a significant merger\nor acquisition, in advance of making its\nrecommendation to shareholders.\n\nWe will vote against transactions that, in our\nassessment, do not advance our clients\u0092\nfinancial interests.\n\nAnti-takeover defenses\n\nIn principle, we do not support companies\nusing\nanti-takeover defenses, also known as poison\npills or shareholder rights plans, as they can\nentrench management and boards which have not\ndelivered long-term shareholder value. By\nexception, a poison pill may be supported if\nits purpose is to delay\na takeover that is considered sub-optimal and\nenable management to seek an improved offer.\nSimilarly, management could make the case to\nuse a poison pill to block a shareholder\nactivism campaign that may be\ncounter to the interests of other investors.\nDefense mechanisms introduced in these\ncircumstances should be limited in term and\nthreshold, and also be closely monitored by\nthe independent members of the board. We look\nfor a shareholder vote for any\nmechanisms expected to be in place for more\nthan 12 months.\n\nShareholder activism\n\nWhen companies are the focus of an activism\ncampaign, we may engage with the activist to\nunderstand their analysis and objectives, once\nthey have gone public. We will\nalso engage with company management and\npossibly board members, especially those the\nactivist may be seeking to replace. In our\nassessment, we evaluate various factors,\nincluding the concerns raised by the activist\nand the case for change; the\nquality of both the activist\u0092s and\nmanagement\u0092s plans; and the qualifications of\neach party\u0092s candidates. We evaluate each\ncontested situation by assessing the potential\nfinancial outcome for our clients as minority\nshareholders.\n\nWe may support board candidates nominated by a\nshareholder activist if the activist has\ndemonstrated that their case for change\nenhances shareholder value, or if the\nincumbent board members do not demonstrate the\nrelevant skills and expertise or have a poor\ntrack record of protecting shareholders\u0092\ninterests.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u200911      \n                                              \nSignificant shareholders and related party\ntransactions\n\nBoards of companies with affiliated\nshareholders or directors should be able to\ndemonstrate that the interests of all\nshareholders are given equitable\nconsideration.\n\nTransactions with related parties, such as\nsignificant shareholders or companies\nconnected with the public company, should be\ndisclosed in detail and conducted on\nterms similar to what would objectively have\nbeen agreed with a non-related party. Such\ntransactions should be reviewed and approved\nby the independent members of the board, and\nif voted on, only disinterested\nshareholders should vote.\n                                              \n   Corporate reporting, risk management and   \n   audit                                      \n                                              \nInvestors depend on corporate reporting, both\nregulatory and voluntary, to understand a\ncompany\u0092s strategy, its implementation and\nfinancial performance, as well as\nto assess the quality of management and\noperations and potential for the company to\ncreate shareholder value over time. The board\nshould oversee corporate reporting and the\npolicies and procedures underpinning the\ninternal audit function and\nexternal audit.\n\nA company\u0092s financial reporting should provide\ndecision-useful information for investors and\nother stakeholders on its financial\nperformance\nand position. It should provide an accurate\nand balanced assessment of the risks and\nopportunities the company faces in realizing\nits long-term strategy. Accordingly, the\nassumptions made by management and reviewed by\nthe auditor in preparing the\nfinancial statements should be reasonable and\njustified. Financial statements should be\nprepared in accordance with globally developed\nreporting standards and any divergence from\ngenerally accepted accounting principles\nshould be explained in detail\nand justified. Accounting restatements should\nbe explained in detail and any remedial\nactions, and the implications of these,\ndisclosed.\n\nIn this context, audit\ncommittees play a vital role in a company\u0092s\nfinancial reporting system by providing\nindependent oversight of the accounts,\nmaterial financial and, where appropriate to\nthe jurisdiction, nonfinancial information,\ninternal control frameworks and\nEnterprise Risk Management systems. In our\nview, effective audit committee oversight\nstrengthens the quality and reliability of a\ncompany\u0092s financial statements and provides an\nimportant level of reassurance to\nshareholders. Audit committees\nshould have a procedure in place for assessing\nthe independence of the auditor and the\nquality of the external audit process\nannually.\n\nSimilarly, material\nsustainability-related factors that are\nintegral to how a company manages risks or\ngenerates revenue should be disclosed. In our\nview, the standards developed by the\nInternational Sustainability Standards Board,\ncan be helpful to companies in\npreparing such reports.\n\nCompanies should establish\nrobust risk management and internal control\nprocesses appropriate to the company\u0092s\nbusiness, risk tolerance, and regulatory\nenvironment. A credible whistleblowing system\nfor employees, and potentially other\nstakeholders, can be a useful\nmechanism for ensuring that senior management\nand the board are aware of potential\nmisconduct or breaches in risk management and\ninternal control processes.\n\nA\ncomprehensive audit conducted by an\nindependent audit firm contributes to investor\nconfidence in the quality of corporate\nreporting. It is helpful when the audit report\ngives some insight into the scope and focus of\nthe audit, as well as any\ncritical audit matters identified and how\nthese were resolved. A comprehensive and\neffective audit is time and resource\nintensive, and the audit fee should be\ncommensurate. Fees paid to the audit firm for\nnon-audit consulting should not exceed the\naudit fee to a degree that may prompt concerns\nabout the independence of the audit. The audit\ncommittee should explain its position on\nauditor tenure and how it\nconfirmed that the auditor remained\nindependent.\n\nThe objective of IFRS S1 General Requirements\nfor Disclosure of Sustainability-related\nFinancial Information is to require an entity\nto disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and\nopportunities that is useful to primary users\nof general-purpose financial reports in making\ndecisions relating to providing resources to\nthe entity. The objective of IFRS S2 Climate-\nrelated Disclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose\ninformation about its climate-related risks\nand opportunities that is useful to primary\nusers of general-purpose financial reports in\nmaking decisions relating to providing\nresources to the entity.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u200912      \n                                              \nWe may vote against the election of the\nresponsible directors if corporate reporting\nis insufficient or there are material\nmisstatements in financial reports. In markets\nwhere relevant, we may vote against a proposal\nto approve the financial statements or the\ndischarge of the board when we are concerned\nabout the quality of the reporting or the\naudit. We may vote\nagainst proposals to appoint the auditor,\nratify the audit report, or approve the audit\nfee if we are concerned about the auditor\u0092s\nindependence, the quality of the audit, or\nthere are material misstatements in financial\nreports and the board\nhas not established reasonable remediation\nplans.\n\nShareholder rights and protections\n\nGeneral shareholder meetings\n\nCompanies normally have an annual general\nmeeting of shareholders at which routine and\nnon-routine items of business are discussed\nand voted on by shareholders in attendance or\nsubmitting proxy votes. Companies should\ndisclose materials relevant to\nthe shareholder meeting sufficiently in\nadvance so that shareholders can take them\ninto consideration in their voting decisions.\nMany companies offer shareholders the option\nof participating in the meeting virtually\nwhich, whilst welcome, should not\nlimit the rights of shareholders to\nparticipate as they would during an in-person\nmeeting.\n\nWe may vote against directors\nwhen materials related to the business of the\nshareholder meeting are not provided in a\ntimely manner or do not provide sufficient\ninformation for us to take an informed voting\ndecision. We may vote against directors if the\nformat of the shareholder\nmeeting does not accommodate reasonable\nshareholder participation.\n\nBylaw amendments\n\nWe review bylaw amendments proposed by\nmanagement on a case-by-case basis and will\ngenerally support those that are aligned with\nthe interests of minority shareholders. Any\nmaterial changes to the bylaws should be\nexplained in detail and put to a shareholder\nvote.\n\nWe may vote against bylaw amendments that\nreduce shareholder rights and protections. We\nmay vote against directors if material changes\nare made to the bylaws without\nshareholder approval.\n\nIf not provided for in the relevant corporate\nlaw, company bylaws should allow shareholders,\nindividually or as a group, with a meaningful\nshareholding the right to call a special\nmeeting of shareholders. The shareholding\nrequired to exercise this right should balance\nits utility with the cost to the company of\nholding special meetings.\n\nIf not provided for in the relevant corporate\nlaw, company bylaws should allow shareholders,\nindividually or as a group, with a meaningful\nshareholding the right to\nnominate directors to the company\u0092s board. The\nthreshold for this right should be set so that\nshareholders can exercise it without being\nunduly disruptive to the board\u0092s own\nnomination process.\n\nWhilst we would not use either of these rights\nourselves, we see them as important\naccountability mechanisms. We may vote for a\nshareholder proposal seeking the\naddition of either of these provisions to a\ncompany\u0092s bylaws.\n\nChange of domicile\n\nWe generally defer to management on proposals\nto change a company\u0092s domicile as long as the\nrationale for doing so is consistent with the\ncompany\u0092s long-term\nstrategy and business model and the related\ncosts are immaterial.\n\nWe may vote against directors or a proposal to\nchange a company\u0092s domicile where it does not\nseem aligned with our clients\u0092 financial\ninterests.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u200913      \n                                              \nChanges to a company\u0092s purpose or the nature\nof its business\n\nPlans to materially change the nature of a\ncompany\u0092s business or its purpose should be\ndisclosed and explained in the context of\nlong-term strategy and business\ndynamics. Such changes may significantly alter\nan investor\u0092s views on the suitability of a\ncompany for their investment strategy or\nportfolio.\n\nWhere relevant,\nwe may vote against proposals to change a\ncompany\u0092s purpose or the nature of its\nbusiness if the board has not provided a\ncredible argument for change.\n\nShareholder proposals\n\nShareholders in many markets, who meet certain\neligibility criteria, have the right to submit\nproposals to the general shareholder meeting\nasking a company to take a particular course\nof action subject to the proposal being\nsupported by a majority of votes cast at the\nmeeting. The topics raised\naddress a range of governance, social and\nenvironmental matters that may be relevant to\na company\u0092s business. Shareholder proposals\nare considered by many investors to be an\nescalation tool when a company is unresponsive\nto their engagement.\n\nWe vote on these proposals on a case-by-case\nbasis. We assess the relevance of the\ntopic raised to a company\u0092s business and its\ncurrent approach, whether the actions sought\nare consistent with shareholders\u0092 interests,\nand what impact the proposal being acted upon\nmight have on financial performance.\n\nOur general approach where we have concerns\nabout a company\u0092s governance, disclosures or\nperformance is to engage to understand the\napparent difference in\nperspective. If we continue to believe the\ncompany is not acting in shareholders\u0092\nfinancial interests, we may vote against the\nelection of directors. We may support a\nrelevant shareholder proposal if doing so\nreinforces the points made in our\nengagement or is aligned with our clients\u0092\nfinancial interests. We generally do not\nsupport shareholder proposals that are legally\nbinding on the company, seek to alter a\ncompany\u0092s strategy or direct its operations,\nor are unrelated to how\na company manages risk or generates financial\nreturns.\n\nBlackRock is subject to legal and regulatory\nrequirements in the U.S. that place\nrestrictions and\nlimitations on how we can interact with the\ncompanies in which we invest on behalf of our\nclients, including our ability to submit\nshareholder proposals. We can vote on behalf\nof clients who authorize us to do so, on\nproposals put forth by others.\n\nCorporate political activities\n\nWe seek to understand how companies\nensure that their direct and indirect\nengagement in the policy making process is\nconsistent with their public statements on\npolicy matters important to the company\u0092s\nlong-term strategy. The board should be aware\nof the approach taken to\ncorporate political activities as there can be\nreputational risks arising from\ninconsistencies. Companies should, as a\nminimum, meet all regulatory disclosure\nrequirements on political activities, and\nideally, provide accessible and clear\ndisclosures to shareholders on policy\npositions, public policy engagement activities\nand political donations. To mitigate the risk\nof inconsistencies, companies can usefully\nassess the alignment between their policy\npriorities and the policy\npositions of the trade associations of which\nthey are active members and any engagements\nundertaken by trade associations on behalf of\nmembers.\n\nGenerally, this is\nan engagement matter, although we may support\na relevant shareholder proposal, or vote\nagainst directors, where a company\u0092s\ndisclosures are insufficient, or it becomes\npublic that there is a material contradiction\nin a company\u0092s public\npolicy positions and its policy engagement.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u200914      \n                                              \nSustainability, or environmental and social,\nconsiderations\n\nWe seek to understand how companies manage the\nrisks and opportunities inherent in their\nbusiness operations. In our experience,\nsustainability-related factors that are\nrelevant to a company\u0092s business or material\nto its financial performance, are generally\noperational considerations embedded into day-\nto-day management systems. Certain\nsustainability issues may also inform long-\nterm strategic planning, for example,\ninvesting in product innovation in\nanticipation of changing consumer demand or\nadapting\nsupply chains in response to changing\nregulatory requirements.\n\nWe recognize that the specific sustainability-\nrelated factors that may be financially\nmaterial or\nbusiness relevant will vary by company\nbusiness model, sector, key markets, and time\nhorizon, amongst other considerations. From\ncompany disclosures and our engagement, we aim\nto understand how management is identifying,\nassessing and integrating\nmaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities into their business decision-\nmaking and practices. Doing so helps us\nundertake a more holistic assessment of a\ncompany\u0092s potential financial performance and\nthe likely risk-adjusted\nreturns of an investment.\n\nWe may vote against directors or support a\nrelevant shareholder proposal if we have\nconcerns about how a company is managing or\ndisclosing its approach to material\nsustainability-related risks that may impact\nfinancial returns.\n\nKey stakeholders\n\nIn our view, companies should understand and\ntake into consideration the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each\ncompany to determine their key stakeholders\nbased on what is material to their business\nand long-term financial performance. For many\ncompanies, key stakeholders include employees,\nbusiness partners (such as suppliers and\ndistributors), clients and\nconsumers, regulators, and the communities in\nwhich they operate. Companies that\nappropriately balance the interests of\ninvestors and other stakeholders are, in our\nexperience, more likely to be financially\nresilient over time.\n\nBy material sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in a company\u0092s\nbusiness model that have an environmental or\nsocial dependency or impact. Examples of\nenvironmental issues\ninclude, but are not limited to, water use,\nland use, waste management, and climate risk.\nExamples of social issues include, but are not\nlimited to, human capital management, impacts\non the communities in which a company\noperates, customer loyalty,\nand relationships with regulators. It is our\nview that well-managed companies will\neffectively evaluate and manage material\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nrelevant to their businesses. Governance is\nthe core means by which boards can\noversee the creation of durable financial\nvalue over time. Appropriate risk oversight of\nbusiness-relevant and material sustainability-\nrelated considerations is a component of a\nsound governance framework.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u200915      \n                                              \nClimate and decarbonization investment\nobjectives\n\nCertain active BlackRock funds have climate\nand decarbonization objectives in addition to\nfinancial objectives. Consistent with the\nobjectives of those investment strategies, our\nstewardship activity in relation to the\nholdings in those funds differs in some\nrespects from BAIS\u0092 benchmark guidelines,\nwhich are described above. Specifically, for\nthose funds\u0092 holdings, we\nlook to investee companies to demonstrate that\nthey are aligned with a decarbonization\npathway that means their business model would\nbe viable in a low-carbon economy, i.e., one\nin which global temperature\nrise is limited to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial\nlevels. This approach is only taken following\nBlackRock receiving the explicit approval from\nthe applicable fund board.\n\nThe decarbonization stewardship guidelines\nfocus on companies which produce goods and\nservices that contribute to real world\ndecarbonization or have a carbon intensive\nbusiness model and face outsized impacts from\nthe low carbon transition, based on reported\nand estimated scopes 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse\ngas emissions. These companies should provide\ndisclosures that set out\ntheir governance, strategy, risk management\nprocesses and metrics and targets relevant to\ndecarbonization. These disclosures should\ninclude an explanation of the decarbonization\nscenarios a company is using in its near- and\nlong-term planning, as\nwell as its scope 1, scope 2 and material\nscope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and\nreduction targets for scope 1 and 2 emissions.\nAs with the BAIS benchmark policies, we\nconsider the climate-risk reporting standard\nissued by the International\nSustainability Standards Board, IFRS S2, a\nuseful reference for such reporting.\n\nUnder these climate- and decarbonization-\nspecific\nguidelines, BAIS may recommend a vote against\ndirectors or support for a relevant\nshareholder proposal if a company does not\nappear to be adequately addressing or\ndisclosing material climate-related risks. We\nmay recommend supporting shareholder\nproposals seeking information relevant to a\ncompany\u0092s stated low-carbon transition\nstrategy and targets that the company does not\ncurrently provide and that would be helpful to\ninvestment decision-making.\nAs under the BAIS benchmark approach, the\nactive portfolio managers are ultimately\nresponsible for voting consistent with their\ninvestment mandate and fund objectives.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u200916      \n                                              \nAppendix 1: How we fulfil and oversee our\nactive investment stewardship responsibilities\n\nOversight\n\nThe Global Head of BAIS has primary oversight\nof and\nresponsibility for the team\u0092s activities,\nincluding voting in accordance with the\nBlackRock Active Investment Stewardship Global\nEngagement and Voting Guidelines (\u0093the\nGuidelines\u0094), which require the application of\nprofessional\njudgment and consideration of each company\u0092s\nunique circumstances, as well as input from\nactive investors. BAIS is independent from\nBlackRock Investment Stewardship in our\nengagement and voting activities, reporting\nlines, and oversight.\n\nThe Active Investment Stewardship Oversight\nCommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nof the active investment, legal and risk\nteams, reviews and advises on\namendments to BAIS\u0092 Global Engagement and\nVoting Guidelines. The Committee also\nconsiders developments in corporate\ngovernance, related public policy, and market\nnorms and how these might influence BAIS\u0092\npolicies and practices. The\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BAIS and the\nrelevant active equity investors.\n\nIn addition, there is a standing\nadvisory group of senior active investors who\ncounsel BAIS on complex or high-profile votes\nbefore a recommendation is finalized and\nescalated to the portfolio managers with\nholdings in the company under consideration.\nThis group also formally\nreviews any revisions to the Engagement and\nVoting Guidelines proposed by BAIS as part of\nits annual review.\n\nBAIS carries out engagement with companies in\ncollaboration with active investment\ncolleagues, executes proxy votes, and conducts\nvote operations (including maintaining records\nof votes cast) in a manner consistent with the\nGuidelines. BAIS also conducts research on\ncorporate governance issues\nand participates in industry discussions to\ncontribute to and keep abreast of important\ndevelopments in the corporate governance\nfield. BAIS may use third parties for certain\nof the foregoing activities and performs\noversight of those third parties\n(see \u0093Use and oversight of third-party vote\nservices providers\u0094 below).\n\nVoting guidelines and vote execution\n\nBlackRock votes on proxy issues when our\nclients authorize us to do so. We carefully\nconsider the voting items submitted to funds\nand other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) for\neach Fund for which we have voting authority\nbased on our evaluation of the alignment of\nthe voting items with the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients,\nin the exercise of our independent business\njudgment, and without regard to the\nrelationship of the issuer (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u0092s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u0092s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees (see\n\u0093Conflicts management policies and\nprocedures,\u0094 below).\n\nWhen exercising voting rights, BAIS will\nnormally vote on\nspecific proxy issues in accordance with the\nGuidelines, although portfolio managers have\nthe right to vote differently on their\nholdings if they determine doing so is more\naligned with the investment objective and\nfinancial interests of clients\ninvested in the funds they manage.\n\nThe Guidelines are not intended to be\nexhaustive. BAIS applies the Guidelines on a\ncase-by-case basis, in the context of the\nindividual circumstances of each company and\nthe specific issue under review. As such, the\nGuidelines do not indicate how BAIS will vote\nin every instance. Rather,\nthey reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. The\nGuidelines are reviewed annually and updated\nas necessary to reflect changes\nin market practices, developments in corporate\ngovernance and feedback from companies and\nclients. In this way, BAIS aims to maintain\npolicies that explain our approach to\ngovernance practices most aligned with\nclients\u0092 long-term financial\ninterests.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u200917      \n                                              \nIn certain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BAIS\u0092\nability to vote such proxies, as\nwell as the desirability of voting such\nproxies. These issues include, but are not\nlimited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder\nmeetings; ii) restrictions on a foreigner\u0092s\nability to exercise votes; iii) requirements\nto vote proxies in person;\niv) \u0093share-blocking\u0094 (requirements that\ninvestors who exercise their voting rights\nsurrender the right to dispose of their\nholdings for some specified period in\nproximity to the shareholder meeting); v)\npotential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as\nshare-blocking or overly burdensome\nadministrative requirements.\n\nBlackRock votes proxies in these situations on\na \u0093best-efforts\u0094 basis. In addition, BAIS\nmay determine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u0092s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints)\nassociated with exercising a vote are expected\nto outweigh the benefit the client would\nderive by voting on the proposal.\n\nVoting Choice\n\nBlackRock offers , a program that provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and\noperationally viable.\n\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nand Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) and multi-asset\nstrategies. In addition, institutional clients\nin separately managed accounts (SMAs) are\neligible for BlackRock Voting Choice\nregardless of their investment strategies.\n\nAs a result, the shares attributed to\nBlackRock in company share registers may be\nvoted differently depending on\nwhether our clients have authorized BAIS to\nvote on their behalf, have authorized\nBlackRock to vote in accordance with a third-\nparty policy, or have elected to vote shares\nin accordance with their own policy. Our\nclients have greater control\nover proxy voting because of Voting Choice.\nBlackRock does not disclose client\ninformation, including a client\u0092s selection of\nproxy policy, without client consent.\n\nUse and oversight of third-party vote services\nproviders\n\nThird-party vote\nservices providers \u0096 or proxy research firms \u0096\nprovide research and recommendations on proxy\nvotes, as well as voting infrastructure. As\nmentioned previously, BlackRock contracts\nprimarily with the vote services provider ISS\nand leverages\nits online platform to supply research and\nsupport voting, record keeping, and reporting\nprocesses. We also use Glass Lewis\u0092 research\nand analysis as an input into our voting\nprocess. It is important to note that,\nalthough proxy research firms\nprovide important data and analysis, BAIS does\nnot rely solely on their information or follow\ntheir voting recommendations. A company\u0092s\ndisclosures, our past engagements and voting,\ninvestment colleagues\u0092 insights and our voting\nguidelines\nare important inputs into our voting decisions\non behalf of clients.\n\nGiven the large universe of actively held\ncompanies, BAIS employs the proxy services\nprovider\nto streamline the voting process by making\nvoting recommendations based on BAIS\u0092 voting\nguidelines when the items on a shareholder\nmeeting agenda are routine. Agenda items that\nare not routine are referred back to BAIS to\nassess, escalate as\nnecessary to the relevant portfolio managers\nand vote. BAIS reviews and can override the\nrecommendations of the vote services provider\nat any time prior to the vote deadline. Both\nBAIS and the vote services provider actively\nmonitor securities\nfilings, research reports, company\nannouncements, and direct communications from\ncompanies to ensure awareness of supplemental\ndisclosures and proxy materials that may\nrequire a modification of votes.\n\nWith Voting Choice, SMAs have the ability to\nselect from a set of voting policies from\nthird-party proxy advisers\nthe policy that best aligns with their views\nand preferences. BlackRock can then use its\nproxy voting infrastructure to cast votes\nbased on the client\u0092s selected voting policy.\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u200918      \n                                              \nBAIS closely monitors the third-party vote\nservices providers we contract with to ensure\nthat they are meeting our service\nlevel expectations and have effective policies\nand procedures in place to manage potential\nconflicts of interest. Our oversight of\nservice providers includes regular meetings\nwith client service teams, systematic\nmonitoring of vendor operations, as\nwell as annual due diligence meetings in\naccordance with BlackRock\u0092s firmwide policies.\n\nConflicts management policies and procedures\n\nBAIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u0092s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship\nbetween the investee company (or any\nshareholder proponent or dissident\nshareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock\u0092s\naffiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u0092s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees.

In addition, BlackRock seeks    \n       to ensure that all engagements with    \n       corporate issuers, dissident           \n       shareholders or shareholder            \n       proponents are managed consistently    \n       and without regard to BlackRock\u0092s       \n       relationship with such parties.        \n       Clients or                             \n       business partners are not given        \n       special treatment or differentiated    \n       access. BAIS prioritizes engagements   \n       based on factors including, but not    \n       limited to, our need for additional    \n  \u00b7    information to make a voting decision  \n       or our view on the likelihood that     \n       an engagement could lead to positive   \n       outcome(s) over time for the economic  \n       value of the company. Within the       \n       normal course of business, BAIS may    \n       engage directly with BlackRock         \n       clients, business partners and/or      \n       third parties, and/or with employees   \n       with sales, vendor management, or      \n       business partnership roles, in         \n       discussions regarding our approach to  \n       stewardship, general corporate         \n       governance matters, client reporting   \n       needs, and/or to otherwise ensure      \n       that proxy-related client service      \n       levels are                             \n       met                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Determined to engage, in certain       \n       instances, an independent third-party  \n       voting service provider to make proxy  \n       voting                                 \n       recommendations as a further           \n       safeguard to avoid potential           \n       conflicts of interest, to satisfy      \n       regulatory compliance requirements,    \n       or as may be otherwise required by     \n       applicable law.

Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower.\n\nWith regard to the relationship between\nsecurities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock\ncannot vote shares on loan and may determine\nto recall them for voting, as guided\nby our fiduciary duty as an asset manager to\nour clients in helping them achieve their\ninvestment goals. While this has occurred in a\nlimited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u0092s securities lending\nprogram in order to vote is based on an\nevaluation of various factors that include,\nbut are not limited to, assessing potential\nsecurities lending revenue alongside the\npotential long-term financial value to clients\nof voting those securities (based\non the information available at the time of\nrecall consideration). BAIS works with active\nportfolio managers, as well as colleagues in\nthe Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams, to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of\nrecalling shares on loan.\n\nIn almost all instances, BlackRock anticipates\nthat the potential long-term financial value\nto clients of voting shares would not warrant\nrecalling securities on loan. However, in\ncertain instances, BlackRock may determine, in\nour independent business judgment as a\nfiduciary, that the value of voting outweighs\nthe securities lending revenue loss to clients\nand would therefore recall\nshares to be voted in those instances.\n\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may\nmodify it as necessary.\n\nReporting and vote transparency\n\nBAIS is\ncommitted to transparency in the stewardship\nwork we do on behalf of clients. We inform\nclients about our engagement and voting\npolicies and activities through direct\ncommunication and disclosure on our .\n                                              \n  BlackRock\u00a0Active\u00a0      Global\u00a0Engagement\u00a0   \n  Investment\u00a0            and\u00a0Voting           \n  Stewardship            Guidelines\u2002\u00e7\u200920      \n                                              \nWant to know more?\n\n|\n\nThe document is provided for information\npurposes only and is subject to change.\nReliance upon this information is at the sole\ndiscretion of the reader.\n\nPrepared by BlackRock, Inc.\n\nUnited States and elsewhere.

Potential material\nconflicts, and the resultant potential for\nundue influence, might be due to a\nrelationship between the investee company (or\nany shareholder proponent or dissident\nshareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock\u0092s\naffiliates or employees, or a Fund or a Fund\u0092s\naffiliates. BlackRock has taken certain steps\nto mitigate potential conflicts, which are\noutlined in detail in\nthe Guidelines.

We\nconsider it one of our responsibilities to be\nan informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf, given the business decisions\nthat companies make have a direct impact on\nour clients\u0092 long-term investment outcomes and\nfinancial well-being. BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) is a dedicated function\nwithin BlackRock,\nwhich is responsible for engaging with public\ncompanies on behalf of index strategies.\nInvestment Stewardship is one of the ways we\nfulfill our fiduciary responsibilities as an\nasset manager to our clients. Our sole\nobjective when conducting our\nstewardship program is to advance our clients\u0092\nlong-term financial interests.\n\nBIS takes a\nlong-term approach in our stewardship efforts,\nreflecting the investment horizons of the\nmajority of our clients. BIS does this\nthrough:\n\n1. Engaging\nwith companies in a two-way dialogue to build\nour understanding of a company\u0092s practices and\ninform our voting decisions.\n\n2. Voting at shareholder meetings on\nmanagement and shareholder proposals on behalf\nof clients who have delegated voting authority\nto BlackRock.\n\n3. Contributing to industry dialogue on\nstewardship to share our perspectives on\nmatters that may impact our clients\u0092\ninvestments.\n\n4. Reporting on our activities to inform\nclients about our stewardship efforts on their\nbehalf through a range of publications and\ndirect reporting.\n\nPhilosophy on investment stewardship\n\nSound\ngovernance is critical to the success of a\ncompany, the protection of investors\u0092\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. Research indicates that high-\nperforming companies will effectively evaluate\nand address risks and opportunities\nrelevant to their businesses, which supports\ndurable, long-term financial value creation.\n\nSetting, executing,\nand overseeing strategy are the responsibility\nof management and the board. As one of many\nminority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u0096 and\ndoes not try to \u0096 direct a company\u0092s strategy\nor its implementation. Our role, on behalf of\nBlackRock\u0092s clients as long-term investors, is\nto better understand how corporate leadership\nis managing material risks and capitalizing on\nopportunities to help protect and enhance the\ncompany\u0092s ability to deliver long-term\nfinancial\nreturns. We aim to take a globally consistent\napproach, while recognizing the unique markets\nand sectors in which companies operate.\n\nShareholder rights\n\nCorporate law, regulations and listing rules\nin most markets establish certain fundamental\nrights attached to\nshareholding. Shareholders should have the\nright to:\n                                              \n       Elect, remove, and nominate            \n  \u00b7    directors, approve the appointment of  \n       the auditor, and amend the corporate   \n       charter or by-laws.                    \n                                              \nBIS\u0092 Benchmark Policies, and the vote\ndecisions made consistent with these policies,\ntake a\nfinancial materiality-based approach and are\nfocused solely on advancing clients\u0092 financial\ninterests. BIS\u0092 Benchmark Policies\u0096 comprised\nof the BIS , , and \u0096 apply to clients\u0092 assets\ninvested through index strategies and provide\nguidance on our position on common corporate\ngovernance matters. We take a globally\nconsistent approach, while recognizing the\nunique markets and\nsectors in which companies operate. BlackRock\noffers a wide range of investment products and\nfunds to support our clients\u0092 unique and\nvaried investment objectives.

Through\nstewardship, we assess how companies are\ncreating long-term financial value to serve\nour clients, many of whom are saving for long-\nterm goals, such as retirement.\n\nAs shareholders of public companies, our\nclients have the right to vote on matters\nproposed by a company\u0092s management or its\nshareholders. Voting is an important\nmechanism for investors to express support\nfor, or concern about, a company\u0092s performance\nand most of our clients authorize BlackRock to\nexercise this right on their behalf. For those\nclients, and as a fiduciary, BlackRock is\nlegally required\nto make proxy voting determinations in a\nmanner that is consistent with their\ninvestment objectives. BIS does this by\ncasting votes in favor of proposals that, in\nour assessment, will promote stronger\ngovernance and better operating practices and,\nin turn, potentially enhance long-term\nshareholder value. Our vote decisions are\ninformed by our in-depth analysis of company\ndisclosures, engagement with boards and\nmanagement teams, third-party research, and\ncomparisons against a company\u0092s industry\npeers.\n\nBIS takes a constructive, long-term approach\nto our engagement with companies, reflecting\nthe investment\nhorizons of the majority of our clients. An\nengagement is a meeting between BIS and a\ncompany\u0092s board and management that helps\nimprove our understanding of the company\u0092s\nbusiness model and material risks and\nopportunities, to inform our\nvoting decisions on behalf of clients who\nauthorize us to vote on their behalf. In these\ntwo-way conversations, we listen to and learn\ndirectly from company directors and executives\nand ask questions relevant\nto their business. Either a company or BIS can\nrequest an engagement. Many of the engagements\nare initiated by companies to discuss their\nlong-term strategy, risk and opportunity set,\nand management\u0092s plan to deliver financial\nreturns through\nbusiness cycles. The ongoing, multiyear nature\nof our engagements allows us to build strong\nrelationships with company leadership and\nmutual understanding on key matters of\ncorporate governance and the drivers of long-\nterm financial performance.\n\nGenerally, we support the vote recommendations\nof the board of directors and management. In\ncase of concerns, we typically raise these\nthrough dialogue with board\nmembers and management teams first. When we\ndetermine it is in our clients\u0092 financial\ninterests to convey concern to companies\nthrough voting, we do so in two forms: we\nmight not support the election of directors or\nother management proposals,\nor we might not support management\u0092s voting\nrecommendation on a shareholder proposal.\n\nKey themes\n\nWhile accepted standards and norms of\ncorporate governance can differ between\nmarkets, in our experience, there are certain\nglobally applicable fundamental elements of\ncorporate governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u0092s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u0093Principles\u0094), which are\nanchored in\ntransparency and accountability.\n                                              \n  BlackRock             Global Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment            4                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted corporate\ngovernance standards in their domestic\nmarket, and we ask that, if they do not, they\nexplain how their approach better supports\ndurable, long-term financial value creation.\n\nThese Principles cover seven key subjects:\n                            \n      Boards and directors  \n                            \n                                         \n      Auditors and audit-related issues  \n                                         \n                                              \n      Capital structure, mergers, asset       \n      sales, and other special transactions   \n                                              \n                              \n      Executive compensation  \n                              \n                                              \n      Material sustainability-related risks   \n      and opportunities                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Other corporate governance matters and  \n      shareholder protections                 \n                                              \n                             \n      Shareholder proposals  \n                             \nOur regional and market-specific explain how\nthese Principles inform our voting decisions\nin relation to common ballot items for\nshareholder\nmeetings in those markets. Alongside the\nPrinciples and regional voting guidelines, BIS\npublishes our which reflect the on which we\nmost frequently engage companies, where they\nare relevant, as these\ncan be a source of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship program globally and within each\nmarket. The BIS policies are not\nprescriptive, applied on a pragmatic, case-by-\ncase basis, taking into consideration a number\nof factors, including the sector, market, and\nbusiness environment within\nwhich a company is operating.\n\nBoards and directors\n\nCompanies whose boards are comprised of\nappropriately qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u0092s business enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. A\nstrong board gives a company a competitive\nadvantage, providing valuable oversight and\ncontributing to the most important management\ndecisions that support\nlong-term financial performance. As part of\ntheir responsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. This is why our\ninvestment stewardship efforts\nhave always started with the performance of\nthe board of directors, and why we see\nengagement with, and the election of,\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. We engage, as necessary,\nwith members of the board\u0092s nominating\nand/or governance committee to assess whether\ngovernance practices and board composition are\nappropriate given a company\u0092s business model\nand we take into consideration a number of\nfactors, including the sector, market, and\nbusiness environment\nwithin which a company is operating.\n\nWe view it as good practice when the board\nestablishes and maintains a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms\nto support its oversight of the company\u0092s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors\nengage with and oversee management. Disclosure\nof material risks that may affect a company\u0092s\nlong-term strategy and financial value\ncreation, including material sustainability-\nrelated factors when relevant, is helpful for\ninvestors to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks.\n\nWe seek to understand management\u0092s\nlong-term strategy and the milestones against\nwhich investors should assess its\nimplementation. If any strategic targets are\nsignificantly missed or materially restated,\n\nOur regional voting guidelines, which we\npublish on the BIS , reflect these different\nmarket standards and norms. Depending on the\nmarket, generally accepted practice is\ninformed by\ncorporate law, market regulation, best\npractices, and industry initiatives, amongst\nother factors.\n                                              \n  BlackRock             Global Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment            5                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nwe find it helpful when company disclosures\nprovide a detailed explanation of the changes\nand an indication of the board\u0092s role in\nreviewing the revised targets. We look to the\nboard to\narticulate the effectiveness of these\nmechanisms in overseeing the management of\nbusiness risks and opportunities and the\nfulfillment of the company\u0092s strategy.\n\nWhere a company has not adequately disclosed\nand demonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we may\nconsider voting against the election of\ndirectors who, on our assessment, have\nparticular responsibility for the issues. We\nassess director performance on a case-by-case\nbasis and in light of each company\u0092s\ncircumstances, taking into consideration its\ngovernance, business practices that support\ndurable, long-term financial value creation,\nand performance. Set out below are factors we\nmay take into\nconsideration.\n\nRegular accountability through director\nelections\n\nTo\nensure accountability for their actions on\nbehalf of shareholders, directors should stand\nfor election on a regular basis, ideally\nannually. Annual director elections allow\nshareholders to\nreaffirm their support for board members\nand/or hold them accountable for their\ndecisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that,\nthrough a board cycle, all directors have had\ntheir appointment re-confirmed, with a\nproportion of directors being put forward for\nelection at each annual general meeting.\n\nEffective board composition\n\nRegular director elections also give boards\nthe\nopportunity to adjust their composition in an\norderly way to reflect developments in the\ncompany\u0092s strategy and the market environment.\nIn our view, it is beneficial for new\ndirectors to be brought onto the board\nperiodically to refresh the\ngroup\u0092s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board and seek a balance between\nthe knowledge and experience of longer-serving\ndirectors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently.\n\nWe encourage companies to regularly review the\neffectiveness of their board (including its\nsize), and assess\ndirectors nominated for election in the\ncontext of the composition of the board as a\nwhole. In our view, the company\u0092s assessment\nshould consider a number of factors, including\neach director\u0092s independence and time\ncommitments, as well as\nthe breadth and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\ncollectively contribute to the board\u0092s\neffectiveness in advising and overseeing\nmanagement in delivering long-term financial\nreturns.\n\nDirector independence \u0097 from management,\nsignificant shareholders, or other related\nparties \u0096 is a central tenet of sound\ncorporate governance across markets. We\nencourage boards to have a sufficient number\nof independent directors, free from conflicts\nof interest or undue influence, to ensure\nobjectivity in the decision-making of the\nboard and its ability\nto oversee management. We generally consider\nit good practice for independent directors to\nmake a majority of the board, or in the case\nof controlled companies, at least one-third.\n\nCommon impediments to independence may include\nbut are not limited to:\n                                              \n      Current or recent employment at the     \n      company or a subsidiary                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Being, or representing, a shareholder   \n      with a substantial shareholding in the  \n      company                                 \n                                              \n                                  \n      Interlocking directorships  \n                                  \n                                              \n      Having any other interest, business,    \n      or other relationship which could, or   \n      could reasonably be perceived to,       \n      materially                              \n      interfere with a director\u0092s ability to   \n      act in the best interests of the        \n      company and shareholders                \n                                              \nIn most markets directors stand for re-\nelection on an\nannual or triennial basis, as determined by\ncorporate law, market regulation or voluntary\nbest practice.\n\nPlease see: Tokyo Stock Exchange. \u0093.\u0094 June 11,\n2021; Financial Reporting Council. \u0093UK\nCorporate Governance Code.\u0094 July 16,\n2018; Investor Stewardship Group. \u0093.\u0094\n                                              \n  BlackRock             Global Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment            6                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nIn our experience, boards are most effective\nat overseeing and advising management when\nthere is a senior, independent\nboard leader. This director may chair the\nboard, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or\nis otherwise not independent), be designated\nas a lead independent director. The role of\nthis director is to enhance the effectiveness\nof the independent\nmembers of the board through shaping the\nagenda, ensuring adequate information is\nprovided to the board, and encouraging\nindependent director participation in board\ndeliberations. The lead independent director\nor another appropriate director should\nbe available to meet with shareholders in\nthose situations where an independent director\nis best placed to explain and contextualize a\ncompany\u0092s approach.\n\nThere are matters for which the board has\nresponsibility that may involve a conflict of\ninterest for executives or for affiliated\ndirectors or require\nadditional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees with\na majority of independent directors, depending\non market norms and a company\u0092s ownership\nstructure. In many markets,\nthese committees of the board specialize in\naudit, director nominations, and compensation\nmatters. An ad hoc committee might also be\nformed to decide on a special transaction,\nparticularly one involving a related party, or\nto investigate a\nsignificant adverse event.\n\nWhen nominating directors to the board, we\nlook to companies to provide sufficient\ninformation on the individual candidates so\nthat\nshareholders can assess the capabilities and\nsuitability of each individual nominee and\ntheir fit within overall board composition.\nThese disclosures should give an understanding\nof how the collective experience and expertise\nof the\nboard, as well as the particular skill sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u0092s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u0092s\nbusiness and strategy enhance the ability of\nthe board to add value and be the voice of\nshareholders in board discussions.\n\nIt is in this context that we are\ninterested in a variety of experiences,\nperspectives, and skillsets in the board room.\nWe see it as a means of promoting diversity of\nthought to avoid \u0093group think\u0094 in the board\u0092s\nexercise of its responsibilities to advise and\noversee\nmanagement.\n\nIn assessing board composition, we take a\ncase-by-case approach based on\na company\u0092s board size, business model,\nstrategy, location and market capitalization.\nWe look for companies to explain how their\napproach to board composition supports the\ncompany\u0092s governance practices.\n\nWe note that in many markets, policymakers\nhave set board gender diversity goals which we\nmay discuss with companies, particularly if\nthere is a risk their board\ncomposition may be misaligned. We ask boards\nto disclose, consistent with local laws, how\ndiversity, including professional and personal\ncharacteristics, is considered in board\ncomposition, given the company\u0092s long-term\nstrategy and business\nmodel.\n\nSufficient capacity\n\nAs the role and expectations of a director are\nincreasingly demanding, directors must be able\nto commit an appropriate amount of time to\nboard and committee matters. It\nis important that directors have the capacity\nto meet all of their responsibilities \u0096\nincluding when there are unforeseen events \u0096\nand therefore, they should not take on an\nexcessive number of roles that would impair\ntheir ability to\nfulfill their duties.\n\nAuditors and audit-related issues\n\nBlackRock recognizes the critical importance\nof financial statements, which should provide\na true and fair picture of a company\u0092s\nfinancial condition. Accordingly,\nwe look for the assumptions made by management\nand reviewed by the auditor in preparing the\nfinancial statements to be reasonable and\njustified.\n\nThe accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly\nrecognize that a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\n\nPersonal characteristics may include, but are\nnot limited to, gender; race/ethnicity;\ndisability;\nveteran status; LGBTQ+; and national,\nIndigenous, religious, or cultural identity.\n                                              \n  BlackRock             Global Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment            7                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial\nstatements, particularly those that pertain to\nthe impact of the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy on a company\u0092s business model and\nasset mix. We recognize that this is an area\nof evolving practice and\nnote that international standards setters,\nsuch as the International Financial Reporting\nStandards (IFRS) Board and the International\nAuditing and Assurance Standards Board\n(IAASB), continue to develop their guidance to\ncompanies.\n\nIn this context, audit committees, or\nequivalent, play a vital role in a company\u0092s\nfinancial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a\ndedicated risk committee, these committees can\nprovide oversight of Enterprise Risk\nManagement systems. In our view, effective\naudit committee oversight strengthens the\nquality and reliability of\na company\u0092s financial statements and provides\nan important level of reassurance to\nshareholders.\n\nAudit committees or equivalent should have\nclearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on\nmanagement, internal audit, and the\nindependent auditor in fulfilling their\nresponsibilities but look to committee members\nto demonstrate they have relevant expertise to\nmonitor and oversee the audit process and\nrelated activities.\n\nWe take particular note of unexplained changes\nin reporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material\nfinancial weakness. In this respect, audit\ncommittees should provide timely disclosure on\nthe remediation of Key and Critical Audit\nMatters identified either by the external\nauditor or internal audit function.\n\nThe integrity of financial statements depends\non the auditor being free of any impediments\nto being an effective check on management. To\nthat end, it is important that\nauditors are, and are seen to be, independent.\nWhere an audit firm provides services to the\ncompany in addition to the audit, we look for\nthe fees earned to be disclosed and explained.\nWe look for Audit committees to have in place\na procedure for\nassessing annually the independence of the\nauditor and the quality of the external audit\nprocess.\n\nComprehensive disclosure provides investors\nwith a sense of the\ncompany\u0092s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u0092s oversight. We look to\nthe audit or risk committee to periodically\nreview the company\u0092s risk assessment and risk\nmanagement\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u0092s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that\ncompanies are not adequately managing risk.\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions\n\nThe capital structure of a company is critical\nto shareholders as it impacts the value of\ntheir investment and the priority of their\ninterest in the company relative to\nthat of other equity or debt investors. Pre-\nemptive rights are a key protection for\nshareholders against the dilution of their\ninterests.\n\nEffective voting rights are basic rights of\nshare ownership and a core principle of\neffective governance. Shareholders, as the\nresidual claimants, have the strongest\ninterest in protecting the financial value of\nthe company, and voting rights should match\neconomic exposure, i.e. one share, one vote.\n\nIFRS, \u0093\u0094, June 2023, and IAASB, \u0093\u0094, August\n2023.\n\nEnterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u0092s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to\nbe within the risk appetite, to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the achievement\nof objectives. Please see the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO), \u0093\u0094, 2023.\n                                              \n  BlackRock             Global Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment            8                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nIn principle, we disagree with the creation of\na share class with equivalent economic\nexposure and preferential,\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nthis structure violates the fundamental\ncorporate governance principle of\nproportionality and results in a concentration\nof power in the hands of a few shareholders,\nthus disenfranchising other shareholders\nand amplifying any potential conflicts of\ninterest. However, we recognize that in\ncertain markets, at least for a period of\ntime, companies may have a valid argument for\nlisting dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the\ncompany\u0092s shareholder meeting. The proposal\nshould give unaffiliated shareholders the\nopportunity to affirm the current structure or\nestablish mechanisms to end or phase out\ncontrolling structures at the appropriate\ntime, while minimizing costs\nto shareholders.\n\nIn assessing mergers, asset sales, or other\nspecial transactions, BlackRock\u0092s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our\nclients as shareholders. Boards proposing a\ntransaction should clearly explain the\neconomic and strategic rationale behind it. We\nwill review a proposed transaction to\ndetermine the degree to which it can enhance\nlong-term shareholder value. We find\nlong-term investors like our clients typically\nbenefit when proposed transactions have the\nunanimous support of the board and have been\nnegotiated at arm\u0092s length. We may seek\nreassurance from the board that the financial\ninterests of\nexecutives and/or board members in a given\ntransaction have not adversely affected their\nability to place shareholders\u0092 interests\nbefore their own. Where the transaction\ninvolves related parties, the recommendation\nto support should come from\nthe independent directors, a best practice in\nmost markets, and ideally, the terms should\nhave been assessed through an independent\nappraisal process. In addition, it is good\npractice that it be approved by a separate\nvote of the non-conflicted parties.\n\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in\nthe open market without unnecessary\nrestriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms\ndesigned to limit shareholders\u0092 ability to\nsell their shares are contrary to basic\nproperty rights. Such mechanisms can serve to\nprotect and entrench interests\nother than those of the shareholders. In our\nview, shareholders are broadly capable of\nmaking decisions in their own best interests.\nWe encourage any so-called \u0093shareholder rights\nplans\u0094 proposed by\na board to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\n\nExecutive compensation\n\nIn most markets, one of the most important\nroles for a company\u0092s board of directors is to\nput in place a compensation structure that\nincentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. Executive\ncompensation is an important tool used by\ncompanies to support long-term financial value\ncreation. In our experience, well-structured\ncompensation policies reward the successful\ndelivery of strategic, operational,\nand/or financial goals, encourage an\nappropriate risk appetite, and align the\ninterests of shareholders and executives\nthrough equity ownership.\n\nWe look for there\nto be a clear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u0092s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on whether\ncompanies should use\nsustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but, where they are\nincluded, we look to companies to be as\nrigorous as they would be in setting other\nfinancial or operational targets. Long-term\nincentive plans should encompass\ntimeframes that 1) are distinct from annual\nexecutive compensation structures and metrics,\nand 2) encourage the delivery of strong\nfinancial results over a period of years.\n\nWhen designing, reviewing, and approving\nexecutive compensation policies, board\ncompensation committees \u0096 or board members\nresponsible for setting executive\ncompensation \u0096 should carefully consider the\ncompany\u0092s specific circumstances, such as its\nrisk profile, the environment in which it\noperates, and the individuals the board is\ntrying to attract, retain and incentivize. We\nlook to the\ncompensation committees to guard against\ncontractual arrangements that would entitle\nexecutives to material compensation for early\ntermination of their employment. Finally,\npension contributions and other\n                                              \n  BlackRock             Global Principles\u2002\u00e7\u2009  \n  Investment            9                     \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \ndeferred compensation arrangements should be\nreasonable in light of market practices or the\ncompany\u0092s business and executive compensation\nstrategies.\n\nWe are not supportive of one-off or special\nbonuses unrelated to company or individual\nperformance. Where discretion has been\nused by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we appreciate disclosure relating\nto how and why the discretion was used, and\nhow the adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group\nevaluation by compensation committees can help\nensure competitive pay; however, we are\nconcerned when the rationale for increases in\ntotal compensation at a company is solely\nbased on peer benchmarking, rather than also\nconsidering rigorous measures\nof outperformance. We encourage companies to\nclearly explain how compensation outcomes have\nrewarded performance.\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback\nprovisions into incentive plans such that\ncompanies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the\nforegoing of the grant of any awards by any\nsenior executive whose behavior caused\nmaterial financial harm to shareholders,\nmaterial reputational risk to the company, or\nresulted in a criminal investigation, even if\nsuch actions did not ultimately\nresult in a material restatement of past\nresults.\n\nIn our view, non-executive directors should be\ncompensated in a manner\nthat is commensurate with the time and effort\nexpended in fulfilling their professional\nresponsibilities. Additionally, these\ncompensation arrangements should not risk\ncompromising directors\u0092 independence or\naligning their interests too closely\nwith those of the management, whom they are\ncharged with overseeing.\n\nBIS may convey concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u0092s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures.\n\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities\n\nIt is our view that well-managed companies\nwill effectively evaluate and manage material\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nrelevant to their businesses. As with all\nrisks and opportunities in a company\u0092s\nbusiness model, appropriate oversight of\nmaterial sustainability considerations is a\ncore component of having an effective\ngovernance framework\nthat supports durable, long-term financial\nvalue creation.\n\nRobust disclosure allows investors to\neffectively evaluate companies\u0092 strategy and\nbusiness\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. We find it\nhelpful when companies\u0092 disclosures\ndemonstrate that they have a resilient\nbusiness model that integrates material\nsustainability-related risks and\nopportunities into their strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and\nS2 may prove helpful to companies in preparing\nthis disclosure. The standards build on the\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD) framework and the standards\nand metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have both\nconverged under the ISSB. We recognize that\ncompanies may phase in reporting aligned with\nthe ISSB standards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of voluntary standards. In such cases,\nwe ask that companies highlight the metrics\nthat are industry- or company-specific.\n\nBy material sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in a company\u0092s\nbusiness model that have an environmental or\nsocial dependency\nor impact. Examples of environmental issues\ninclude, but are not limited to, water use,\nland use, waste management, and climate risk.\nExamples of social issues include, but are not\nlimited to, human capital management, impacts\non the communities in\nwhich a company operates, customer loyalty,\nand relationships with regulators.\n\nThe objective\nof General Requirements for Disclosure of\nSustainability-related Financial Information\nis to require an entity to disclose\ninformation about its sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of\ngeneral-purpose financial reports in making\ndecisions relating to providing resources to\nthe entity. The objective of Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about\nits climate-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\n                                              \n  BlackRock              Global Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment             10                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nWe note that climate and other sustainability-\nrelated disclosures often require companies to\ncollect and aggregate data\nfrom various internal and external sources. We\nrecognize that the practical realities of data\ncollection and reporting may not line up with\nfinancial reporting cycles and companies may\nrequire additional time after their fiscal\nyear-end to accurately collect, analyze, and\nreport this data to investors. That said,\nwhile we do not prescribe timelines regarding\nwhen companies make these disclosures, we\nencourage them to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities to\nprovide investors with time to assess the data\nand make informed decisions.\n\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations\nor the Organization for Economic Cooperation\nand Development. Further, industry initiatives\non managing specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. While not a voting\nitem, we find it\nhelpful to our understanding of investment\nrisk when companies disclose any relevant\nglobal climate and other sustainability-\nrelated standards adopted, the industry\ninitiatives in which they participate, any\npeer group benchmarking undertaken, and\nany assurance processes to help investors\nunderstand their approach to sustainable and\nresponsible business practices.\n\nClimate and nature-related risk\n\nIn our view, the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy is one of several mega forces\nreshaping markets. Our research shows that the\nlow-carbon transition is a structural shift in\nthe global economy that will be shaped by\nchanges in government policies,\ntechnology, and consumer and investor\npreferences, which may be material for many\ncompanies. Yet the path to a low-carbon\neconomy is uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are\nassessing how to navigate the low-carbon\ntransition while delivering long-term\nfinancial value to investors. At companies\nwhere these climate-related risks are\nmaterial, we find it helpful when they\npublicly\ndisclose, consistent with their business model\nand sector, how they intend to deliver long-\nterm financial performance through the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, including\nwhere available, their transition\nplan.\n\nIn our experience, disclosure consistent with\nthe ISSB standards or the TCFD framework can\nhelp\ninvestors assess company-specific climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities, and inform\ninvestment decisions. Such disclosures also\nprovide investors with insights into how\ncompanies are managing\nthe risks associated with climate change by\nmanaging their own carbon emissions or\nemissions intensities to the extent\nfinancially practicable. Recognizing the value\nof these disclosures, in some jurisdictions,\nlike the U.K, large companies must\ndisclose such climate-related financial\ninformation on a mandatory basis, while in\nother jurisdictions these disclosures are\nviewed as best practice in the market.\n\nBlackRock Investment Institute, \u0093Mega forces:\nAn investment opportunity\u0094, 2023.\n\nBlackRock Investment Institute, \u0093Tracking the\nlow-carbon transition\u0094, July 2023.\n\nWe have observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policymakers\nin are signaling their intentions to require\nthem or already have requirements in place,\nsuch as Australia, Brazil, and the European\nUnion. We view transition plans as a method\nfor a company to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate its long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. Transition plans\nare building\nmomentum internationally, with increased focus\nfrom policy makers and supervisors, including\nin the EU, UK, G7, G20, and from the financial\nindustry. While many initiatives across\njurisdictions outline a framework for\ntransition plans,\nthere is no consensus on the key elements\nthese plans should contain. We view useful\ndisclosure as one that communicates a\ncompany\u0092s approach to managing financially\nmaterial business relevant risks and\nopportunities \u0096 including\nclimate-related risks \u0096 to deliver long-term\nfinancial performance, which allows investors\nto make more informed decisions. While\ntransition plans can be helpful disclosure,\nBIS does not make the preparation and\nproduction of transition plans a\nvoting issue. BIS may engage companies that\nhave chosen to publish a transition plan to\nunderstand their planned actions and resource\nimplications.\n\nBlackRock, \u0093Global perspectives on investing\nin the low-carbon transition\u0094, June 2023. We\nrecognize that companies may phase in\nreporting aligned\nwith the ISSB standards over several years,\ndepending on local requirements. We also\nrecognize and respect that some companies may\nreport using different local standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies disclose their rationale for\nreporting in line with the specific disclosure\nframework chosen and highlight the metrics\nthat are industry- or company-specific.\n                                              \n  BlackRock              Global Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment             11                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nConsistent with the ISSB standards and the\nTCFD framework, we seek to understand, from\ncompany disclosures and engagement,\nthe strategies companies have in place to\nmanage material risks to, and opportunities\nfor, their long-term business model associated\nwith a range of climate-related scenarios.\nThis includes a scenario in which global\nwarming is limited to well below\n2\u00b0C, considering ambitions to achieve a limit\nof 1.5\u00b0C, the temperature goal recently\nreaffirmed by G20 members as part of the 2024\nLeader\u0092s Declaration.\n\nThese frameworks also contemplate disclosures\non how companies are setting short-, medium-\nand long-term targets, ideally science-based\nwhere these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors.\n\nWhile we recognize that regulators in some\nmarkets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding material scope 3\nemissions and recognize\nthese are provided on a good-faith basis as\nmethodology develops. Our publicly available\nprovides more information on our approach to\nclimate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nIn addition to climate-related risks and\nopportunities, the management of nature-\nrelated factors is increasingly a component of\nsome companies\u0092 ability to generate\ndurable, long-term financial returns for\nshareholders, particularly where a company\u0092s\nstrategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for\nsuch companies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will\nevaluate these disclosures to inform our view\nof how a company is managing material nature-\nrelated risks and opportunities. We rely on\ncompany disclosures when determining how to\nvote on shareholder proposals addressing\nnatural capital issues. Our\npublicly available provides more information\non our approach to natural capital.\n\nCompanies\u0092 impact on their workforce, supply\nchains, and communities\n\nIn\norder to advance long-term shareholders\u0092\ninterests, companies should consider the\ninterests of the various parties on whom they\ndepend for their success over time. It is for\neach company to determine their key\nstakeholders based on what is\nmaterial to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they\noperate.\n\nAs a long-term shareholder on behalf of our\nclients, we find it helpful when companies\ndisclose how they have identified their key\nstakeholders and\nconsidered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies discuss how they\nconsider the needs of their workforce today,\nand the skills required for\ntheir future business strategy. We are also\ninterested to understand how the board\nmonitors and engages on these matters, given\nit is well positioned to ensure that the\napproach taken by management is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u0092s\nstrategy.\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships\nwith their stakeholders. We encourage\ncompanies to\n\nIn November 2024, G20 members reaffirmed the\nParis Agreement temperature goal as part of\nthe\n. G20 members include the world\u0092s major\neconomies (19 countries and two regional\nbodies, the European Union and African Union),\nrepresenting 85% of global Gross Domestic\nProduct, over 75% of\ninternational trade, and about two-thirds of\nthe world population.\n\nGiven the growing awareness of the materiality\nof these issues for certain businesses,\nenhanced reporting on a company\u0092s natural\ncapital dependencies and impacts would aid\ninvestors\u0092\nunderstanding. In our view, the final\nrecommendations of the (TNFD) may prove useful\nto some companies. We recognize that some\ncompanies may report using different\nstandards, which may be\nrequired by regulation, or one of a number of\nother private sector standards. TNFD-aligned\nreporting is not a voting issue.\n                                              \n  BlackRock              Global Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment             12                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nimplement, to the extent appropriate,\nmonitoring processes (often referred to as due\ndiligence) to identify and mitigate potential\nadverse impacts and grievance mechanisms to\nremediate any actual\nadverse material impacts. In our view,\nmaintaining trust within these relationships\ncan contribute to a company\u0092s long-term\nsuccess.\n\nOther corporate governance matters and\nshareholder protections\n\nIn our view, shareholders have a right to\nmaterial and timely information on the\nfinancial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure\nprovided by companies help shareholders assess\nthe effectiveness of the board\u0092s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u0092 economic\ninterests have been protected. As a general\nprinciple, we believe shareholders should have\nthe right to\nvote on key corporate governance matters,\nincluding changes to governance mechanisms, to\nsubmit proposals to the shareholders\u0092 meeting,\nand to call special meetings of shareholders.\n\nCorporate form\n\nIn our view, it is the responsibility of the\nboard to\ndetermine the corporate form that is most\nappropriate given the company\u0092s purpose and\nbusiness model. Companies proposing to change\ntheir corporate form to a public benefit\ncorporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. We appreciate when supporting\ndocumentation from companies or shareholder\nproponents proposing to alter the corporate\nform clearly\nexplains how the interests of shareholders and\ndifferent stakeholders would be impacted as\nwell as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. We generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates\nthat shareholders\u0092 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis.\n\nShareholder proposals\n\nIn most markets in\nwhich BlackRock invests on behalf of clients,\nshareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on at a company\u0092s annual\nor extraordinary meeting, as long as\neligibility and procedural requirements are\nmet. The matters that we see put\nforward by shareholders address a wide range\nof topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks.\n\nBlackRock is subject to legal and regulatory\nrequirements in the U.S. that place\nrestrictions and limitations on how BlackRock\ncan interact with the companies in which\nwe invest on behalf of our clients, including\nour ability to submit shareholder proposals.\nWe can vote, on behalf of clients who\nauthorize us to do so, on proposals put forth\nby others.\n\nWhen assessing shareholder proposals, we\nevaluate each proposal on its merit,\nconsidering the company\u0092s individual\ncircumstances and maintaining a singular focus\non\nthe proposal\u0092s implications for long-term\nfinancial value creation. BIS\u0092 evaluation\nconsiders whether a shareholder proposal\naddresses a material risk that, if left\nunmanaged, may impact a company\u0092s long-term\nperformance. We look for\nconsistency between the specific request\nformally made in the proposal, the supporting\ndocumentation and the proponents\u0092 other\ncommunications on the issues. We also assess\nthe company\u0092s practices and disclosures and\nthe costs and\nbenefits to the company of meeting the request\nmade in the proposal. We take into\nconsideration a company\u0092s governance practices\nand disclosures against those of their peers.\n\nIn our experience, it is helpful when\ncompanies disclose the names of the proponent\nor organization that has submitted or advised\non the proposal.\n\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company, are unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on\nmanagement. We take into\n\nCorporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n                                              \n  BlackRock              Global Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment             13                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nconsideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed\nillegal in a given jurisdiction.\n\nBIS is likely to support shareholder proposals\nthat request disclosures that help us, as\nlong-term investors on behalf of our\nclients, better understand the material risks\nand opportunities companies face and how they\nare managing them, especially where this\ninformation is additive given the company\u0092s\nexisting disclosures. We may also support\nshareholder proposals\nthat are focused on a material business risk\nthat we agree needs to be addressed and the\nintended outcome is consistent with long-term\nfinancial value creation.\n\nWe\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests.\nFurther, the proponent\u0092s supporting statement\nmay refer to topics that are not directly\nrelated to the request made in the proposal.\nIn voting on behalf of\nclients, we do not submit or edit proposals or\nthe supporting statements \u0096 we must vote yes\nor no on the proposal as phrased by the\nproponent. Therefore, when we vote in support\nof a proposal, we are not necessarily\nendorsing every element of\nthe proposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients\u0092\nlong-term financial interests. We typically\nexplain to the company our rationale for\nsupporting such proposals.\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst\nthe election of one or more directors if, in\nour assessment, the board has not responded\nsufficiently or with an appropriate sense of\nurgency to a material risk. We may also\nsupport a proposal if management is on track,\nbut we believe that voting in\nfavor might accelerate efforts to address a\nmaterial risk.\n\nBlackRock\u0092s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities\n\nOversight\n\nBlackRock maintains advisory committees\n(Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees), generally consisting of\nsenior BlackRock index investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines). The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS.\n\nIn addition to the Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of the Global Head of\nInvestment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nsenior BlackRock executives with legal,\nrisk and other experience relevant to team\noversight. The Global Committee does not\ndetermine voting decisions, which are the\nresponsibility of BIS.\n\nThe Global Head\nhas primary oversight of the activities of\nBIS, including voting in accordance with the\nGuidelines, which require the application of\nprofessional judgment and consideration of\neach company\u0092s unique circumstances. The\nGlobal Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines.\n\nIn addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations.

BlackRock\nvotes (or refrains from voting) proxies for\neach Fund for which we have voting authority\nbased on our evaluation of the alignment of\nthe voting items with the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients,\nin the exercise of our independent business\njudgment, and without regard to the\nrelationship of the issuer of the proxy (or\nany shareholder proponent or dissident\nshareholder) to the Fund, the Fund\u0092s\naffiliates (if any), BlackRock or\nBlackRock\u0092s affiliates, or BlackRock employees\n(see \u0093Conflicts management policies and\nprocedures,\u0094 below).\n\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Principles.\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u0092s general\nphilosophy and approach to issues that may\ncommonly arise in the proxy voting context in\neach market where we invest. The Guidelines\nare not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies\nthe Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather,\nthey reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. The\nGuidelines are reviewed annually and updated\nas necessary to reflect changes\nin market practices, developments in corporate\ngovernance and feedback from companies and\nclients. In this way, BIS aims to maintain\npolicies that explain our approach to\ngovernance practices most aligned with\nclients\u0092 long-term financial\ninterests. BIS analysts may exercise their\nprofessional judgment in determining how to\nvote if they conclude that the Guidelines do\nnot cover the specific matter raised by a\nballot item or that an exception to the\nGuidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u0092s\nclients.\n\nIn certain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u0092\nability to vote\nsuch proxies, as well as the desirability of\nvoting such proxies. These issues include, but\nare not limited to: i) untimely notice of\nshareholder meetings; ii) restrictions on a\nforeigner\u0092s ability to exercise votes; iii)\nrequirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u0093share-blocking\u0094\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential\ndifficulties in translating the proxy; vi)\nregulatory constraints; and vii) requirements\nto provide local agents with unrestricted\npowers of attorney to facilitate voting\ninstructions. We are not supportive of\nimpediments to the exercise of voting\nrights such as share-blocking or overly\nburdensome administrative requirements.\n\nBlackRock votes proxies in these situations on\na \u0093best-efforts\u0094 basis. In\naddition, BIS may determine that it is\ngenerally in the interests of BlackRock\u0092s\nclients not to vote proxies (or not to vote\nour full allocation) if the costs (including\nbut not limited to opportunity costs\nassociated with share-blocking\nconstraints) associated with exercising a vote\nare expected to outweigh the benefit the\nclient would derive by voting on the proposal.\n\nVoting Choice\n\nBlackRock offers a program that provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting\nprocess where legally and operationally\nviable.\n\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the\nU.S., UK, Ireland, and Canada that utilize\ncertain equity index investment strategies, as\nwell as eligible clients in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nand Canada that use systematic active equity\n(SAE) strategies. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be\n                                              \n  BlackRock              Global Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment             15                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \neligible for BlackRock Voting Choice\nregardless of their investment strategies.\nBlackRock also launched a U.S. Program to\noffer proxy voting\nto eligible shareholder accounts in a U.S.\nFund.\n\nAs a result, the shares attributed to\nBlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own\npolicy. Our clients have greater control over\nproxy voting because of Voting Choice.\nBlackRock does not disclose client\ninformation, including a client\u0092s selection of\nproxy policy, without client consent.\n                                              \n   Conflicts management policies and          \n   procedures                                 \n                                              \nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u0092s\nproxy voting activity.

Securities lending is a\nwell-regulated practice that contributes to\ncapital market efficiency. It also enables\nfunds to generate additional returns while\nallowing fund providers to\nkeep fund expenses lower.\n\nWith regard to the relationship between\nsecurities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock\ncannot vote shares on loan and may determine\nto\nrecall them for voting, as guided by our\nfiduciary duty as an asset manager to our\nclients in helping them achieve their\ninvestment goals. While this has occurred in a\nlimited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u0092s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to\nclients of voting those securities (based on\nthe information available at the time of\nrecall consideration). BIS works with\ncolleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk\nand Quantitative\nAnalysis teams to evaluate the costs and\nbenefits to clients of recalling shares on\nloan.\n\nIn almost all instances, BlackRock anticipates\nthat the potential\nlong-term financial value to the Fund of\nvoting shares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the\nvalue of voting outweighs the securities\nlending revenue loss to clients and would\ntherefore recall shares to be voted in those\ninstances.\n\nRecalling securities on loan can be impacted\nby the timing of record dates. In the U.S.,\nfor example, the record date of a shareholder\nmeeting typically falls before the proxy\nstatements are\nreleased. Accordingly, it is not practicable\nto evaluate a proxy statement, determine that\na vote has a material impact on a fund and\nrecall any shares on loan in advance of the\nrecord date for the annual meeting. As a\nresult, managers must weigh\nindependent business judgement as a fiduciary,\nthe benefit to a fund\u0092s shareholders of\nrecalling loaned shares in advance of an\nestimated record date without knowing whether\nthere will be a vote on matters which have a\nmaterial impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u0092s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n                                              \n  BlackRock              Global Principles\u2002\u00e7  \n  Investment             17                   \n  Stewardship                                 \n                                              \nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may\nmodify it as necessary.\n\nReporting and vote transparency\n\nWe are committed to transparency in the\nstewardship work we do on behalf of clients.\nWe inform clients about our engagement and\nvoting policies and activities through\ndirect communication and through disclosure on\nour . Additionally, we make public our\nregional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf.

BIS\ndoes this through:\n                                              \n      Engaging with companies in a two-way    \n  1.  dialogue to build our understanding     \n      of a company\u0092s practices and inform our  \n      voting decisions.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Voting at shareholder meetings on       \n      management and shareholder proposals    \n  2.  on behalf of clients who have           \n      delegated                               \n      voting authority to BlackRock.          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Contributing to industry dialogue on    \n  3.  stewardship to share our perspectives   \n      on matters that may impact our          \n      clients\u0092 investments.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      Reporting on our activities to inform   \n  4.  clients about our stewardship efforts   \n      on their behalf through a range of      \n      publications and direct reporting.      \n                                              \nStewardship for clients with investment\nobjectives\n\nrelating to the low-carbontransition 2\n\nBlackRock offers a wide range of investment\nproducts and funds to support our clients\u0092\nunique and varied investment objectives, and\nin February 2024, BlackRock\nannounced it would be launching a new\ndecarbonization stewardship option for those\nclients who explicitly direct BlackRock to\ninvest their assets with decarbonization\ninvestment objectives. An increasing number of\nclients are seeking to minimize the\nfinancial risk, and maximize the financial\nopportunities, associated with the transition\nto a low-carbon economy, and thus are\ninterested in sustainable and transition\ninvesting, with some including\ndecarbonization as an investment objective in\ntheir mandates with BlackRock. In Europe for\nexample, all of our largest, strategic\nrelationship clients have net zero commitments\nfor their organizations, and globally a\ngrowing number have made similar\ncommitments, which those clients believe, will\nshape financial opportunities in the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy. A survey\nof 200 institutional investors globally,\nrepresenting nearly $9tn in assets\nunder management, indicated that 98% of them\nhave set some kind of transition investment\nobjective for their portfolios.\n\nThese guidelines set out BIS\u0092 approach to\nvoting at companies\u0092 shareholder meetings on\nbehalf of funds with explicit decarbonization\nor climate-related\ninvestment objectives, and, when appropriate,\nengagement with corporate leadership to\nsupport our voting on clients\u0092 behalf. In\naddition, clients in separately managed\naccounts may instruct\nBlackRock to apply these guidelines to their\nholdings. Both in the case of funds and\nseparately managed accounts, these guidelines\nare only implemented upon explicit selection\nand approval by the applicable fund board or\nclient.\n\nWe have heard from a growing number of clients\nglobally that they have made, or are planning\nto make, commitments to align their investment\nstrategies with the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. This\nstewardship option helps those clients meet\ntheir climate and decarbonization investment\nobjectives and is part of BlackRock\u0092s\ncommitment to offer clients choice.\n\nKey climate, decarbonization and low-carbon\ntransition related terms used\nin these guidelines are explained in appendix\n1.\n\nTo help inform the choices BlackRock offers\nour clients, in\nJune 2023 we commissioned iResearch Services,\nan independent third-party research\nconsultancy, to conduct a on our behalf. The\nsurvey sought to better understand\ninstitutions\u0092 needs and preferences related to\ninvesting in\nthe low-carbon transition.\n\nA list of approved funds is on\nBlackRock\u0092s website .\n                                              \n  BlackRock             BlackRock\u00a0Climate\u00a0    \n  Investment            and\u00a0Decarbonization\u00a0  \n  Stewardship           Stewardship\u00a0          \n                        Guidelines\u00a0|\u00a02        \n                                              \nThese guidelines should be read in conjunction\nwith BIS\u0092 and are focused on matters related\nto climate risks and the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy at companies that are held by\nfunds and clients who have\nselected these guidelines. These guidelines\ndiffer from the benchmark policies in that\nthey consider, in addition to financial\nconsiderations and consistent with the\ninvestment objective of each fund or account\nthat has selected these guidelines,\nthe alignment of companies\u0092 business model and\nstrategies with the financial opportunities\npresented by the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy and the more ambitious goal of the\nParis Agreement, namely to limit average\ntemperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial\nlevels.\n\nThese guidelines will apply to companies which\nproduce goods and services that contribute to\nreal world decarbonization or have a carbon\nintensive business model and\nface outsized impacts from the low-carbon\ntransition, based on reported and estimated\nscopes 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe estimate these\ncompanies represent the vast majority of the\nvalue chain emissions of the companies held by\nfunds and clients that have selected these\nguidelines. For all other companies held by\nthese funds and clients, BIS\u0092 benchmark voting\nguidelines apply.\n\nOn other matters not related to climate risks\nand the transition to a low-carbon economy,\nBIS will apply our benchmark\npolicies.\n\nFor clients who have not directed BlackRock to\nprioritize climate risks and decarbonization\nas an investment objective, BIS will continue\nto undertake\nour stewardship responsibilities in line with\nour benchmark policies, with a sole focus on\nadvancing those clients\u0092 long-term economic\ninterests. This will include consideration of\nclimate-related risks and opportunities in a\ncompany\u0092s\nbusiness model, where material to the\ncompany\u0092s ability to deliver long-term\nfinancial returns.\n\nPlease see appendix 2, which sets out the key\ndifferences\nbetween the BIS benchmark and decarbonization\npolicies on items related to climate risk and\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nUnderstanding the investment implications of\nthe transition to a low-carboneconomy\n\nResearch from the BlackRock Investment\nInstitute (BII) highlights that changing\ngovernment policy, technology, and consumer\nand investor preferences are driving the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, but these\nforces are moving at uneven speeds across\nsectors and regions. For example\u0097some\ntechnologies like renewable power are already\nbeing deployed at scale in some\nregions, while in other sectors and regions\nless cost-effective low-carbon alternatives\nexist. We have heard from certain clients that\nthey see the low-carbon transition\nas a series of shifts over decades that will\nreshape production and consumption, spur\nsignificant capital investment and create\nrisks, opportunities and a wider range of\nfinancial and competitive outcomes for\ncompanies.\n\nFor clients interested in investing in the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy and\nunderstanding its corresponding risks and\nopportunities, we have developed the BlackRock\nInvestment Institute Transition Scenario\n(BIITS), powered by Aladdin technology. BIITS\nis a research-based, analytical forecast of\nhow the low-carbon transition is most likely\nto play out based on what we know and expect\ntoday. It can help inform a top-down\nassessment of a company\u0092s business risk\narising\nfrom the transition. BII based its key\nassumptions on rigorous research, and the\ninput of BlackRock\u0092s portfolio managers and\nother experts.\n\nBIS\u0092 benchmark policies set out the core\nelements of corporate governance that guide\nour investment stewardship efforts globally\nand within each market, including when\nengaging with companies and voting at\nshareholder meetings. They are\nanchored in our Global Principles, which set\nout certain globally applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u0092s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value, anchored in transparency and\naccountability. They also\ninclude our regional and market-specific\nvoting guidelines, which explain how the\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets. We\npublish our engagement priorities which\nreflect\nthe five themes on which we most frequently\nengage companies, where they are relevant, as\nthese can be a source of material business\nrisk or opportunity. The BIS policies are\napplied on a case-by-case basis, taking into\nconsideration the context within which a\ncompany is operating. They are reviewed\nannually and updated as necessary to reflect\nmarket developments and feedback from clients\nand\ncompanies.\n\nThe .\n\nThese companies may already be low-carbon\noperators, or be demonstrating momentum in\nreducing emissions in their operations,\nproviding key inputs or goods and services\nthat support real world decarbonization, or\npivoting their current business model to\ncontribute to the transition to the low-carbon\neconomy.\n                                              \n  BlackRock             BlackRock\u00a0Climate\u00a0    \n  Investment            and\u00a0Decarbonization\u00a0  \n  Stewardship           Stewardship\u00a0          \n                        Guidelines\u00a0|\u00a03        \n                                              \nFor client assets with explicit investment\nobjectives related to the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy, BIS will draw on the\ninsights generated by BIITS and Aladdin\nClimate, as well\nas our own analysis and engagement, in\napplying these guidelines. In doing so, we\nwill take into consideration the fact that the\nnecessary data to assess individual companies\ncurrently has limitations, but is improving as\na result of disclosure\nrequirements in an increasing number of\njurisdictions.\n\nDecarbonization stewardship guidelines design\nprinciples\n\nThe framework of these guidelines is designed\nto:\n                                              \n       Prioritize sectors and companies that  \n       are critical to the transition to a    \n       low-carbon economy: This includes      \n       companies which produce goods and      \n  \u00b7    services that contribute to real       \n       world decarbonization or have a        \n       carbon intensive business model and    \n       face outsized impacts from the         \n       low-carbon transition.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Apply a sectoral approach to our       \n       analysis that acknowledges the         \n       unevenness of the                      \n       low-carbon transition across sectors   \n       and markets: We take into              \n       consideration the varying speeds at    \n       which sectors and markets can          \n  \u00b7    decarbonize based on technological     \n       feasibility, consumer demand,          \n       government                             \n       policy, regulatory frameworks and      \n       other factors. Further, we recognize   \n       that these factors are uncertain and   \n       dynamic, which will require that we    \n       evolve our approach as necessary.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Take a long-term, pragmatic approach   \n       that favors a transition that          \n       minimizes disruption to companies and  \n       their key                              \n       stakeholders: Our approach recognizes  \n       the challenges that many companies     \n       face in adapting their business        \n       models.

Further, we consider the    \n       differences between the actions and    \n       outcomes over which company            \n       management has influence, and those    \n       it does not.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Focus on useful, contextualized        \n       disclosures that help inform           \n       investors views, while recognizing     \n       data limitations:                      \n       The policy will seek disclosures that  \n  \u00b7    outline key milestones and             \n       dependencies underpinning the          \n       company\u0092s low-carbon transition         \n       strategy; explain the trade-offs       \n       required to adapt the business model;  \n       and                                    \n       include relevant data and narrative.   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Be consistent with our position as a   \n       minority investor on behalf of our     \n       clients: The boards and executive      \n       leadership                             \n       of companies determine a company\u0092s      \n       strategy and its implementation.

Where BIS\ndetermines this is not the case, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nwho have responsibility for the\nissue. The directors most likely to be in\nfocus are the chair of the board sub-committee\nwith low-carbon transition, climate or\nsustainability risk oversight\nresponsibilities, other members of the\nrelevant committee, the lead independent\ndirector or the non-executive chair of the\nboard.

Similarly, we will\ngenerally support management\u0092s proposal on a\nprogress report if the company has clearly\nexplained its progress against, and any\ndeviations from or changes to, its\nstated transition plan and targets.\n\nShareholder proposals on climate and low-\ncarbontransition matters\n\nShareholder proposals on a company\u0092s approach\nto the low-carbon transition or climate risk\nwill be considered on their\nmerit. Our assessment will take into\nconsideration the implications for, and the\nrelevance to, the company\u0092s stated low-carbon\ntransition strategy and targets. We may\nsupport shareholder proposals that,\nfor example, ask a company to:\n                                              \n       Publish a business plan, and related   \n       disclosures, consistent with the       \n  \u25cb    ambition to limit average temperature  \n       rise to no more                        \n       than 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial        \n       levels                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Align their scope 1 and 2 GHG          \n       emissions reduction targets to,        \n  \u25cb    and/or discuss how their targets       \n       align with, a long-term goal           \n       of the company achieving net zero GHG  \n       emissions by 2050                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Disclose the categories of scope 3     \n  \u25cb    GHG emissions most material to a       \n       company\u0092s business model                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Improve disclosures on how a company\u0092s  \n       climate-related lobbying (including    \n  \u25cb    trade association memberships and      \n       other                                  \n       indirect lobbying) is aligned with     \n       its strategic policy positions.        \n                                              \nWe would not support shareholder proposals\nthat seek to constrain board or\nmanagement decision-making or direct specific\nbusiness or strategic decisions. This includes\nproposals that seek to change a company\u0092s\narticles of association or charter to require\ncommitments or actions related to climate risk\nor the low-carbon transition.\n\nRelated matters\n\nThere are other business items not covered\nabove that may be put to a shareholder vote\nthat could address matters relevant to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy. Under\nthese guidelines, BIS is most likely to\nengage, where appropriate, if we seek to\nenhance our understanding of a company\u0092s\napproach. Generally, our voting on these\nmatters would be\ncovered by BIS\u0092 benchmark guidelines.\n\nExecutive compensation\n\nWe\nlook to company boards to put in place a\ncompensation structure that incentivizes and\nrewards executives appropriately. Some\ncompanies, in light of their long-term\nstrategy, may decide to include relevant GHG\nemissions reduction targets or low-carbon\ntransition-related metrics in their incentive\nplans. In such cases, BIS would engage to\nunderstand the alignment between those metrics\nand the company\u0092s stated climate strategy.\n\nWhile BIS may escalate voting by not\nsupporting additional management proposals,\nprincipally director elections,\nwe do not consider filing shareholder\nproposals, preannouncing our voting intentions\nor using the media to amplify our concerns\nappropriate courses of action. We will\ncontinue to take a constructive, long-term\nfocused approach, to our engagement and\nvoting on behalf of clients under these\nguidelines.\n                                              \n  BlackRock             BlackRock\u00a0Climate\u00a0    \n  Investment            and\u00a0Decarbonization\u00a0  \n  Stewardship           Stewardship\u00a0          \n                        Guidelines\u00a0|\u00a07        \n                                              \nAuditors and audit-related issues\n\nFor companies with material climate or\ntransition risks or opportunities in their\nbusiness models, BIS is interested to\nunderstand whether the company considers and,\nif\nrelevant, quantifies, and accounts for\nmaterial climate-related risks in its\nfinancial statements, including if the company\nexplains such risks within the context of its\naudit report. We note that work is being\nundertaken to develop audit and\nassurance standards in relation to climate and\ntransition reporting, which may impact the\nfuture reporting requirements of companies. We\nnote that assurance of corporate disclosures\nrelated to climate risk and the transition to\na low-carbon economy is still nascent.\n\nMergers, acquisitions, asset sales, and other\nspecial situations\n\nSpecial situations will be considered on their\nfinancial merits, but BIS may engage on\nclimate-related factors under these guidelines\nwhere a transaction may\nsignificantly alter a company\u0092s climate\nstrategy or a shareholder activist has\nproposed governance, strategic or operational\nchanges that may impact its climate strategy.\nBIS does not promote changes in corporate\ncontrol, nor does it invoke\nformal governance mechanisms that rise to the\nlevel of shareholder activism.\n\nOther business relevant sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities\n\nClimate risk and the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy are interconnected with a\nnumber of other sustainability-related risks\nand opportunities that may be relevant to a\ncompany\u0092s business model and long-term\nperformance. These include a company\u0092s impacts\nor dependencies on natural capital and key\nstakeholders. In the context of these\nguidelines, we may engage companies to better\nunderstand how they are managing the impact on\npeople (e.g., employees, suppliers, customers\nand communities)\nof any strategic or operational changes they\nare making in relation to their transition to\na low-carbon economy. Similarly, we may engage\ncompanies that face risks and opportunities\nrelated to land use and\ndeforestation, access to fresh water, or the\nability to secure scarce resources critical to\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nBIS\u0092 engagement with companies on these issues\nis informed by our commentaries on ,\nand .\n                                              \n  BlackRock             BlackRock\u00a0Climate\u00a0    \n  Investment            and\u00a0Decarbonization\u00a0  \n  Stewardship           Stewardship\u00a0          \n                        Guidelines\u00a0|\u00a08        \n                                              \nAppendix 1\n\nTerminology\n\nWe understand the key concepts referred to\nwithin these guidelines as follows:\n\nClimate risk: Includes physical risk, the\nincreased risk to companies\u0092 assets and\nactivities caused by the direct impact of\nchanging weather patterns and\nnatural catastrophes, and transition risk, the\nimpact of the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy on a company\u0092s long-term\nprofitability.\n\nTransition to a low-carboneconomy (\u0093low-\ncarbontransition\u0094): The\nglobal economic shift toward lower emissions\nacross many sectors and business models. The\neconomic transformation is being driven by\nchanges in government policy, technology, and\nconsumer and investor preferences, as well as\nthe physical effects of\nclimate change (e.g., extreme weather), and\ncan potentially have a material impact on\nclients\u0092 investments and portfolios.\n\nDecarbonization: the process\nof reducing or eliminating emissions of carbon\ndioxide (CO2) from human activity and removing\ncarbon currently in the atmosphere. This can\nbe carried out by countries, companies and\neven individual consumers. Sometimes the\nconcept is understood to\ninclude the reduction and elimination of other\nGHG, e.g., methane.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities: The\ninvestment opportunities and risks\nassociated with the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy, including transition risks and\nopportunities and physical risks and\nopportunities in adapting to physical climate\nchange.\n\nClimate-related transition plan: \u0093An aspect of\nan entity\u0092s overall strategy that lays out the\nentity\u0092s targets, actions or resources for its\ntransition towards a lower-carbon economy,\nincluding actions such as reducing its\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\u0094\n\nScience-based GHG emissions reduction targets:\nTargets that \u0093 are in line with what the\nlatest climate science deems necessary to meet\nthe goals of the\nParis Agreement \u0096 limiting global warming to\n1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Science-\nbased targets give companies a clearly defined\npath to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in\nline with limiting\nglobal warming to 1.5\u00b0C. They define how much\nand how quickly a business must reduce its\nemissions to be in line with the Paris\nAgreement goals.\u0094\n\nAs defined by the International Sustainability\nStandards Board\u0092s IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures.
