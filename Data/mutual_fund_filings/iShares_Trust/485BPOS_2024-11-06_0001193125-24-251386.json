Fees and Expenses\nThe following table describes the fees and\nexpenses that you will incur if you buy, hold\nand sell shares of the Fund. The investment\nadvisory agreement between iShares Trust (the\n\u201c Trust \u201d ) and BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBFA \u201d ) (the \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d\n) provides that BFA will pay all operating\nexpenses of the Fund, except: (i) the\nmanagement fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii)\ntaxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\n(v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi)\nlitigation expenses and any extraordinary\nexpenses. The Fund may incur \u201c Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses. \u201d Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses reflect the Fund's pro rata share of\nthe fees and expenses incurred indirectly by\nthe Fund as a result of investing in other\ninvestment companies. The impact of Acquired\nFund Fees and Expenses is included in the\ntotal returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees\nand Expenses are not included in the\ncalculation of the ratio of expenses to\naverage net assets shown in the Financial\nHighlights section of the Fund's prospectus\n(the \u201c Prospectus \u201d ).BFA, the investment\nadviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed\nto waive a portion of its management fees in\nan amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses, if any, attributable to investments\nby the Fund in other registered investment\ncompanies advised by BFA, or its affiliates,\nthrough December 31, 2029. The contractual\nwaiver may be terminated prior to December 31,\n2029only upon written agreement of the Trust\nand BFA.

Example.\nThis Example is intended to help\nyou compare the cost of owning\nshares of the Fund with the cost\nof investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest\n$10,000 in the Fund for the time\nperiods indicated and then sell\nall of your shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that\nthe Fund\u2019s operating expenses\nremain the same. Although your\nactual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these\nassumptions, your costs would be:\n                   \n  1 Year  3 Years  \n  $20         $64  \n                   \nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may\npay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes\nwhen Fund shares are held in a\ntaxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. Because the Fund is\nnew, there is no reportable\nturnover. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to\ntrack the investment results of\nthe MSCI ACWI Quality Index (the\n\u201c Underlying Index \u201d ), which is\nbased on a traditional market\ncapitalization-weighted parent\nindex, MSCI ACWI Index (the \u201c\nParent Index \u201d ). The Parent\nIndex includes large- and mid-\ncapitalization equity securities\nin developed and emerging market\ncountries, as defined by MSCI\nInc. (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d or \u201c\nMSCI \u201d ). The Underlying Index\nseeks to capture the performance\nof quality growth stocks by\nidentifying stocks within the\nParent Index that exhibit higher\nquality growth characteristics of\nhigh return on equity, stable\nyear-over-year earnings growth\nand low financial leverage. To\nconstruct the Underlying Index,\nthe Index Provider calculates the\nquality score for each security\nwithin the Parent Index using\nthree fundamental variables:\nreturn on equity, debt to equity\nand earnings variability.\nSecurities in the Parent Index\nwith the higher quality scores\nare selected for inclusion in the\nUnderlying S-2\n\nIndex by the Index Provider up to\na predetermined fixed number of\nsecurities for the Underlying\nIndex. At each rebalancing, the\nqualifying securities are\nweighted by multiplying each\nsecurity\u2019s quality score by its\nweight in the Parent Index and\nthen normalized to 100%.\nAdditionally, at each rebalance,\neach individual issuer\u2019s weight\nin the Underlying Index is capped\nat 5%. To reduce turnover and\nenhance the Underlying Index's\nstability, the Index Provider\napplies buffer rules at 20% of\nthe target number of securities\nthe Index Provider seeks to have\nin the Underlying Index to\nprioritize existing constituents.\nWhen selecting securities ranked\nwithin the 20% above or below the\ntarget number by count, the Index\nProvider will add existing\nconstituents first, followed by\neligible securities from the\nParent Index in order of quality\nscore, as needed, until the\ntarget number of securities is\nreached. The target number of\nsecurities may change depending\non the number of securities the\nIndex Provider aims to reach for\nthe Underlying Index. Between\nrebalances, constituent weights\nmay exceed these constraints due\nto fluctuations in market value,\ncorporate actions or other events\nthat change index composition.\nThe Underlying Index is\nrebalanced semi-annually. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index consisted of\nsecurities from 483 companies in\nthe following countries or\nregions: Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Brazil, Canada, China,\nDenmark, Egypt, Finland, France,\nGermany, Greece, Hong Kong,\nIndia, Indonesia, Israel, Italy,\nJapan, Malaysia, Mexico, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPeru, the Philippines, Poland,\nSaudi Arabia, Singapore, South\nAfrica, South Korea, Spain,\nSweden, Switzerland, Taiwan,\nThailand, Turkey, the United Arab\nEmirates, the United Kingdom (the\n\u201c U.K. \u201d ) and the U.S.\n(together, the \u201c ACWI countries \u201d\n). As of September 30, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the\nUnderlying Index is represented\nby securities of companies in the\nhealth care and technology\nindustries or sectors. The\ncomponents of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over\ntime. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies,\nthe Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not\nseek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or\nappear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially\noutperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may reduce some of the\nrisks of active management, such\nas poor security selection.\nIndexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep\nportfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an\napplicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected\nto have, in the aggregate,\ninvestment characteristics (based\non factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund S-3 may or may\nnot hold all of the securities in\nthe Underlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least\n80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in\ninvestments that have economic\ncharacteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the\ncomponent securities of its\nUnderlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing\nsecurities of the Underlying\nIndex) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures,\noptions and swap contracts, cash\nand cash equivalents, including\nshares of money market funds\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates,\nas well as in securities not\nincluded in the Underlying Index,\nbut which BFA believes will help\nthe Fund track the Underlying\nIndex. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a\nderivative position will be\ntreated as part of that position\nfor the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments\nincluded in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the\nUnderlying Index before fees and\nexpenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing\nup to one-third of the value of\nthe Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any\ncollateral received). The\nUnderlying Index is sponsored by\nMSCI, which is independent of the\nFund and BFA. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition and\nrelative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Underlying\nIndex and publishes information\nregarding the market value of the\nUnderlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments\n( i.e. , hold 25% or more of its\ntotal assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries\nto approximately the same extent\nthat the Underlying Index is\nconcentrated. For purposes of\nthis limitation, securities of\nthe U.S. government (including\nits agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase\nagreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities are not\nconsidered to be issued by\nmembers of any industry. Summary\nof Principal Risks As with any\ninvestment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the\nFund, and the Fund's performance\ncould trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject\nto certain risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share\n( \u201c NAV \u201d ), trading price,\nyield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective.\nCertain key risks are prioritized\nbelow (with others following in\nalphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of any risk\nis difficult to predict and may\nchange over time. You should\nreview each risk factor\ncarefully. Quality Securities\nRisk . Securities that previously\nexhibited greater quality\ncharacteristics than other\nsecurities may not continue to be\nquality securities. Many factors\ncan impact a security\u2019s quality\nand performance, and such factors\nand their impact may be difficult\nto predict. The returns of\nquality securities may be less\nthan the returns of other styles\nof investing or the overall stock\nmarket. Growth Securities Risk .\nGrowth securities are those\nissued by companies whose\nearnings growth potential appears\nto be greater than the market in\ngeneral and whose revenue growth\nis expected to continue for an\nextended period of time. The\nprices of growth securities may\nbe more volatile than those of\nother types of S-4 investments\nand can decline rapidly and\nsignificantly in reaction to\nnegative news. Growth securities\nmay underperform value securities\nand other types of assets as well\nas the overall stock market.\nGrowth securities may go in and\nout of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of\nthe Fund. Equity Securities Risk\n. Equity securities are subject\nto changes in value, and their\nvalues may be more volatile than\nthose of other asset classes. The\nvalue of a security may decline\nfor a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer as\nwell as due to general industry\nor market conditions. Common\nstock is subordinated to\npreferred securities and debt in\na company\u2019s capital structure.\nCommon stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk,\nwith respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event\nof an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money\nover short periods due to short-\nterm market movements and over\nlonger periods during more\nprolonged market downturns.\nLocal, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health\nissues, recessions, the prospect\nor occurrence of a sovereign\ndefault or other financial\ncrisis, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the\nFund and its investments and\ncould result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related Risk.\nThe Index Provider may rely on\nvarious sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components\nof the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be\nbased on assumptions and\nestimates. Neither the Fund nor\nBFA can offer assurances that the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will\nprovide an accurate assessment of\nincluded components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or\nthe construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur,\nand the Index Provider may not\nidentify or correct them promptly\nor at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and\nits shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural\ndisasters, political unrest or\nwar) may impact the Index\nProvider or a third-party data\nprovider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets\nin the Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to financial\nmarkets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index,\nor other asset classes. Assets\nUnder Management (AUM) Risk .\nFrom time to time, an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below in\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk ), a third-\nparty investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, or another fund\nmay invest in the Fund and hold\nits investment for a specific\nperiod of time to allow the Fund\nto achieve size or scale. There\ncan be no assurance that any such\nentity would not redeem its\ninvestment or that the size of\nthe Fund would be maintained at\nsuch levels, which could\nnegatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d is a\nmember or participant of a\nclearing S-5 agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written\nagreement with the Fund or one of\nits service providers that allows\nthe Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and\nredemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number\nof institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the\nFund, including on an agency\nbasis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation\nor redemption orders for the Fund\nand no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor delisting. Concentration Risk.\nThe Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are concentrated in\nthe securities or other assets of\none or more issuers, countries or\nother geographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is\ndetermined in U.S. dollars, the\nNAV could decline if the currency\nof the non-U.S. market in which\nthe Fund invests depreciates\nagainst the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the\nrepatriation of foreign currency.\nCurrency exchange rates can be\nvery volatile and can change\nquickly and unpredictably. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s NAV may change\nquickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur\ncosts in connection with\nconversions between U.S. dollars\nand foreign currencies.\nCybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser,\ndistributor, Index Provider,\nother service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of\nassets in which the Fund invests\nmay cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and\nits shareholders. While the Fund\nhas established business\ncontinuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to\naddress system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and\nsystems. The Fund cannot control\nthe cybersecurity plans and\nsystems of its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third\nparties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. In addition, cyber\nincidents may adversely impact\nthe issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which may\ncause such investments to lose\nvalue. Healthcare Companies Risk\n. The profitability of healthcare\ncompanies may be adversely\naffected by extensive government\nregulations, restrictions on\ngovernment reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of\nmedical products and services,\npricing pressure, the protection\nand expiration of patents,\nlimited product lines, supply\nchain issues, labor shortages and\nproduct liability claims, among\nother factors. Issuer Risk . The\nperformance of the Fund depends\non the performance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to\nwhich the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other\nassets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a\nwhole, due to changes in S-6 the\nfinancial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk.\nLarge-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-\ncapitalization companies to adapt\nto changing market conditions and\ncompetitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be\nmore mature and subject to more\nlimited growth potential compared\nwith smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies\ncould trail the overall\nperformance of the broader\nsecurities markets. Large\nShareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders of the Fund,\nincluding an Authorized\nParticipant, a third-party\ninvestor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser,\na market maker, or another\nentity, may from time to time own\nor manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their\ninvestment in the Fund for a\nlimited period of time. There can\nbe no assurance that any large\nshareholder or large group of\nshareholders would not redeem\ntheir investment. Redemptions of\na large number of Fund shares\ncould require the Fund to dispose\nof assets to meet the redemption\nrequests, which can accelerate\nthe realization of taxable income\nand/or capital gains and cause\nthe Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders\nearlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under\ncertain circumstances, non-\nredeeming shareholders may be\ntreated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable\ndistribution during or with\nrespect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold\na relatively large proportion of\nits assets in cash in\nanticipation of large\nredemptions, diluting its\ninvestment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the\nFund to sell portfolio securities\nor other assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV,\nincrease the Fund\u2019s brokerage\ncosts and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of\nFund shares. Management Risk .\nThe Fund generally does not\nattempt to take defensive\npositions under any market\nconditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not\nfully replicate the Underlying\nIndex and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject\nto the risk that the investment\nstrategy of BFA may not produce\nthe intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces\nnumerous market trading risks,\nincluding the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares\n(including through a trading\nhalt), losses from trading in\nsecondary markets, periods of\nhigh volatility, and disruptions\nin the process of creating and\nredeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may\nlead to the Fund\u2019s shares trading\nin the secondary market at a\npremium or discount to NAV or to\nthe intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy\nFund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a premium to\nNAV or sell Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\ndiscount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the\nunderlying value of the Fund\nshares. S-7 National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the\nextent that securities or other\nassets held by the Fund trade on\nforeign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when\nthe securities exchange on which\nthe Fund\u2019s shares trade is open,\nthere are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current\nprice and its last quoted price (\ni.e ., the quote from the closed\nforeign market to the Fund). The\nimpact of a closed foreign market\non the Fund is likely to be\ngreater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a\nforeign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV that may be greater\nthan those experienced by other\nfunds. Non-Diversification Risk .\nThe Fund is classified as \u201c non-\ndiversified. \u201d This means that,\ncompared with funds that are\nclassified as \u201c diversified, \u201d\nthe Fund may invest a greater\npercentage of its assets in\nsecurities or other instruments\nrepresenting a small number of\nissuers or counterparties and\nthus may be more susceptible to\nthe risks associated with these\nparticular issuers or\ncounterparties. As a result, the\nFund's performance may depend to\na greater extent on the\nperformance of a small number of\nissuers or counterparties, which\nmay lead to more volatility in\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers\n(including depositary receipts)\nare subject to different legal,\nregulatory, political, economic,\nand market risks than securities\nissued by U.S. issuers. These\nrisks include greater market\nvolatility, less market\nliquidity, higher transaction\ncosts, expropriation,\nconfiscatory taxation, adverse\nchanges in foreign investment or\ncurrency control regulations,\nrestrictions on the repatriation\nof capital, and political\ninstability. Non-U.S. issuers may\nbe subject to different\naccounting, audit and financial\nreporting standards than U.S.\nissuers, and there may be less\npublicly available information\nabout non-U.S. issuers. Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different\nclearing and settlement\nprocedures, and holiday schedules\nmay limit the Fund's ability to\nengage in portfolio transactions.\nTo the extent that investments\nare made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those\ncountries will have a more\nsignificant impact on the Fund.\nOperational Risk . The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to,\nhuman error, processing and\ncommunication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Reliance on\nTrading Partners Risk . The Fund\ninvests in countries or regions\nwhose economies are heavily\ndependent upon trading with key\npartners. Any reduction in this\ntrading may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund's investments.\nThrough its holdings of\nsecurities of certain issuers,\nthe Fund is specifically exposed\nto Asian Economic Risk, European\nEconomic Risk and North American\nEconomic Risk . S-8 Risk of\nInvesting in China . Investments\nin Chinese securities, including\ncertain Hong Kong-listed and\nU.S.-listed securities, subject\nthe Fund to risks specific to\nChina. China may be subject to\nconsiderable degrees of economic,\npolitical and social instability.\nChina is an emerging market and\ndemonstrates significantly higher\nvolatility from time to time in\ncomparison to developed markets.\nOver the last few decades, the\nChinese government has undertaken\nreform of economic and market\npractices and has expanded the\nsphere of private ownership of\nproperty in China. However,\nChinese markets generally\ncontinue to experience\ninefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies resulting from\ngovernmental influence, a lack of\npublicly available information\nand/or political and social\ninstability. Chinese companies\nare also subject to the risk that\nChinese authorities can intervene\nin their operations and\nstructure. Internal social unrest\nor confrontations with\nneighboring countries, including\nmilitary conflicts in response to\nsuch events, may also disrupt\neconomic development in China and\nresult in a greater risk of\ncurrency fluctuations, currency\nnon-convertibility, interest rate\nfluctuations and higher rates of\ninflation. China has experienced\nsecurity concerns, such as\nterrorism and strained\ninternational relations.\nAdditionally, China is alleged to\nhave participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against\nforeign companies and foreign\ngovernments. Actual and\nthreatened responses to such\nactivity and strained\ninternational relations,\nincluding purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs\nor cyberattacks on the Chinese\ngovernment or Chinese companies,\nmay impact China\u2019s economy and\nChinese issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests. Incidents\ninvolving China's or the region's\nsecurity may cause uncertainty in\nChinese markets and may adversely\naffect the Chinese economy and\nthe Fund's investments. Export\ngrowth continues to be a major\ndriver of China's rapid economic\ngrowth. Reduction in spending on\nChinese products and services,\nsupply chain diversification,\ninstitution of additional tariffs\nor other trade barriers\n(including as a result of\nheightened trade tensions or a\ntrade war between China and the\nU.S. or in response to actual or\nalleged Chinese cyber activity)\nor a downturn in any of the\neconomies of China's key trading\npartners may have an adverse\nimpact on the Chinese economy.\nThe Underlying Index may include\ncompanies that are subject to\neconomic or trade restrictions\n(but not investment restrictions)\nimposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national\nsecurity, human rights or other\nconcerns of such government. So\nlong as these restrictions do not\ninclude restrictions on\ninvestments, the Fund is\ngenerally expected to invest in\nsuch companies, consistent with\nits objective to track the\nperformance of the Underlying\nIndex. Chinese companies,\nincluding Chinese companies that\nare listed on U.S. exchanges, are\nnot subject to the same degree of\nregulatory requirements,\naccounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more\ndeveloped countries. As a result,\ninformation about the Chinese\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests may be less reliable or\ncomplete. Chinese companies with\nsecurities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they\ndo S-9 not meet U.S. accounting\nstandards and auditor oversight\nrequirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the\nliquidity and value of the\nsecurities. There may be\nsignificant obstacles to\nobtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or\nlitigation against Chinese\ncompanies, and shareholders may\nhave limited legal remedies. The\nFund is not actively managed and\ndoes not select investments based\non investor protection\nconsiderations. Risk of Investing\nin Developed Countries . The\nFund\u2019s investment in developed\ncountry issuers will subject the\nFund to legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security,\neconomic and other risks\nassociated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries\ntend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and\nhave generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less\ndeveloped countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have\nexperienced security concerns,\nsuch as war, terrorism and\nstrained international relations.\nIncidents involving a country\u2019s\nor region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and\nmay adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In\naddition, developed countries may\nbe adversely impacted by changes\nto the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens\nand the price or availability of\ncertain commodities. Risk of\nInvesting in Saudi Arabia .\nInvesting in Saudi Arabian\nissuers subjects the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic\nrisks that are specific to Saudi\nArabia. The economy of Saudi\nArabia is dominated by petroleum\nexports. A sustained decrease in\npetroleum prices could have a\nnegative impact on all aspects of\nthe economy. Investments in the\nsecurities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers involve risks not\ntypically associated with\ninvestments in securities of\nissuers in more developed\ncountries, which may negatively\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. Such heightened\nrisks may include, among others,\nthe expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets,\nrestrictions on and government\nintervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation,\npolitical instability, including\nauthoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental\ndecision-making, armed conflict,\ncrime and instability as a result\nof religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Instability\nin the Middle East region could\nadversely impact the economy of\nSaudi Arabia, and there is no\nassurance of political stability\nin Saudi Arabia. The ability of\nforeign investors to invest in\nthe securities of Saudi Arabian\ncompanies could be restricted by\nthe Saudi Arabian government at\nany time, and unforeseen risks\ncould materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership of such\nsecurities. There are a number of\nways to conduct transactions in\nequity securities in the Saudi\nArabian market. The Fund\ngenerally expects to transact in\na manner so that it is not\nlimited by Saudi Arabian\nregulations to a single broker.\nHowever, there may be a limited\nnumber of brokers who can provide\nservices to the Fund, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the\nprices, quantity or timing of\nFund transactions. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Investing\nin U.S. issuers subjects the Fund\nto legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic\nrisks that are specific to the\nU.S. Certain changes in the U.S.,\nsuch as a weakening of the U.S.\neconomy or a decline in its S-10\nfinancial markets, may have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return\nthe securities in a timely manner\nor at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse\ntax consequences for the Fund.\nSmall Fund Risk. When the Fund\u2019s\nsize is small, the Fund may\nexperience low trading volume and\nwide bid/ask spreads. In\naddition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if it does\nnot meet certain requirements set\nby the listing exchange. Any\nresulting liquidation of the Fund\ncould lead to elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund\nand negative tax consequences for\nits shareholders. Technology\nCompanies Risk . Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances\nmay have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources,\nsupply chains and personnel.\nThese companies typically face\nintense competition, potentially\nrapid product obsolescence and\nchanges in product cycles and\ncustomer preferences. They may\nface unexpected risks and costs\nassociated with technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial\nintelligence and machine\nlearning. Technology companies\nalso depend heavily on\nintellectual property rights and\nmay be adversely affected by the\nloss or impairment of those\nrights. Technology companies may\nface increased government\nscrutiny and may be subject to\nadverse government or legal\naction. Tracking Error Risk . The\nFund may be subject to \u201c tracking\nerror, \u201d which is the divergence\nof the Fund\u2019s performance from\nthat of the Underlying Index.\nTracking error may occur due to a\nnumber of factors, including\ndifferences between the\nsecurities and other assets held\nin the Fund\u2019s portfolio and those\nincluded in the Underlying Index;\ndifferences in the timing and\nmethodologies used to value\nsecurities and other assets;\ntransaction costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Fund\nthat the Underlying Index does\nnot incur; the Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash; differences in\nthe timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund\nshareholders; tax gains or\nlosses; the requirements for the\nFund to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment; portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of\ncustom baskets; changes to the\nUnderlying Index; and impacts to\nthe Fund of complying with\ncertain regulatory requirements\nor limits. Tracking error risk\nmay be heightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nBFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY\nEXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR\nTHAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX\nEXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS ( \u201c ETFs \u201d\n) UNTIL THE FUND REACHES\nSUFFICIENT SCALE. Valuation Risk\n. The price that the Fund could\nreceive upon the sale (or other\ndisposition) of a security or\nother asset may differ from the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the security\nor other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that\ntrade S-11 in low volume or\nvolatile markets or that are\nvalued using a fair value\nmethodology. The price received\nby the Fund also may differ from\nthe value used by the Underlying\nIndex. In addition, the value of\nthe securities or other assets in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio may change\non days or during time periods\nwhen investors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that\ncreate or redeem Fund shares on\ndays when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other\nassets may receive fewer or more\nshares, or lower or higher\nredemption proceeds, than they\nwould have received had the\nsecurities or other assets not\nbeen fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology.\nThe ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological\nissues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party\nservice providers. Performance\nInformation As of the date of the\nProspectus, the Fund has not\ncommenced operations and\ntherefore has no performance\ninformation to report. S-12\nManagement Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer\nHsui, Greg Savage and Paul\nWhitehead (the \u201c Portfolio\nManagers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. Each\nPortfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms.\nHsui, Mr. Savage and Mr.\nWhitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since\ninception (2024). Purchase and\nSale of Fund Shares The Fund is\nan ETF. Individual shares of the\nFund may only be bought and sold\nin the secondary market through a\nbroker-dealer. Because ETF shares\ntrade at market prices rather\nthan at NAV, shares may trade at\na price greater than NAV (a\npremium) or less than NAV (a\ndiscount). An investor may incur\ncosts attributable to the\ndifference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay\nto purchase shares of the Fund\n(bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for\nshares of the Fund (ask) when\nbuying or selling shares in the\nsecondary market (the \u201c bid-ask\nspread \u201d ). Tax Information The\nFund intends to make\ndistributions that may be taxable\nto you as ordinary income or\ncapital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan\nor an individual retirement\naccount ( \u201c IRA \u201d ), in which\ncase, your distributions\ngenerally will be taxed when\nwithdrawn. Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase\nshares of the Fund through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank),\nBFA or other related companies\nmay pay the intermediary for\nmarketing activities and\npresentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems\nor other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a\nconflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or\nother intermediary and your\nsalesperson to recommend the Fund\nover another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your\nfinancial intermediary\u2019s website\nfor more information.

The market\nprice for a share of the Fund may\nbe different from the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. The Fund invests in a\nparticular segment of the markets\nfor securities and other\ninstruments (as applicable) and\nis designed to be used as part of\nbroader asset allocation\nstrategies. Accordingly, an\ninvestment in the Fund should not\nconstitute a complete investment\nprogram. An investment in the\nFund is not a bank deposit, and\nit is not insured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, any other government\nagency, BFA or any of BFA\u2019s\naffiliates. Index Funds A share\nof the Fund represents an\nownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of\nsecurities and other instruments\n(as applicable) that is intended\nto track the Fund\u2019s Underlying\nIndex. An index is a financial\ncalculation, based on a grouping\nof financial instruments, and is\nnot an investment product, while\nthe Fund is an actual investment\nportfolio. The performance of the\nFund and that of its Underlying\nIndex may vary for a number of\nreasons, including transaction\ncosts, asset or currency\nvaluations, corporate actions,\ntiming variances and differences\nbetween the composition of the\nFund\u2019s portfolio and that of the\nUnderlying Index resulting from\nthe Fund\u2019s use of representative\nsampling or from legal\nrestrictions (such as\ndiversification requirements)\nthat apply to the Fund but not to\nits Underlying Index. From time\nto time, the provider of the\nUnderlying Index ( \u201c Index\nProvider \u201d ) may make changes to\nthe index methodology or other\nadjustments to the Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index. Unless\notherwise determined by BFA, any\nsuch change will be reflected in\nthe\n\n1\n\ncalculation of the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s performance on a going-\nforward basis after the effective\ndate of such change. Therefore,\nthe performance of the Underlying\nIndex that is shown for periods\nprior to the effective date of\nany such change generally will\nnot be recalculated or restated\nto reflect the change. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of the\napplicable underlying index.\nBecause the Fund uses\nrepresentative sampling, it can\nbe expected to have a larger\ntracking error than if it used a\nreplication indexing strategy. \u201c\nReplication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests\nin substantially all of the\nsecurities in its underlying\nindex in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying\nindex. Additional Information\nAbout the Fund's Risks Each Fund\nis subject to various risks, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s NAV, trading price, yield,\ntotal return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. Each\nFund discloses its portfolio\nholdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. You could lose\nall or part of your investment in\na Fund, which could underperform\nother investments. The principal\nand other (non-principal) risks\nthat apply to the Fund are\ndescribed below. A Fund that\ninvests in an Underlying Fund\nalso may be indirectly exposed to\nthese risks through such\ninvestment. Principal Risks Asian\nEconomic Risk. Certain Asian\neconomies have experienced rapid\ngrowth and industrialization in\nrecent years, but there is no\nassurance that this growth rate\nwill be maintained. Other Asian\neconomies, however, have\nexperienced high inflation, high\nunemployment, currency\ndevaluations and restrictions,\nand over-extension of credit.\nGeopolitical hostility, political\ninstability, and economic or\nenvironmental events in any one\nAsian country may have a\nsignificant economic effect on\nthe entire Asian region, as well\nas on major trading partners\noutside Asia. Any adverse event\nin the Asian markets may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on\nsome or all of the economies of\nthe countries in which the Fund\ninvests. In particular, China is\na key trading partner of many\nAsian countries and any changes\nin trading relationships between\nChina and other Asian countries\nmay affect the region as a whole.\nMany Asian countries are subject\nto political risk, including\npolitical instability, corruption\nand regional conflict with\nneighboring countries. North\nKorea and South Korea each have\nsubstantial military\ncapabilities, and historical\ntensions between the two\ncountries present the risk of\nwar. Escalated tensions involving\nthe two countries and any\noutbreak of hostilities between\nthe two countries, or even the\nthreat of an outbreak of\nhostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire\nAsian region. Certain Asian\ncountries have developed\nincreasingly strained\nrelationships with the U.S. or\nwith China, and if these\nrelations were to worsen, they\ncould adversely affect Asian\nissuers that rely on the U.S. or\nChina for trade. In addition,\nmany Asian countries are subject\nto social and labor risks\nassociated with demands for\nimproved political, economic and\nsocial conditions. These risks,\namong others, may adversely\naffect the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. 2 Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets\nin a Fund\u2019s portfolio or, if\napplicable, its Underlying Index\nmay underperform in comparison to\nindexes that track, or assets\nthat represent, other countries\nor geographic units, industries,\nmarkets, market segments, or\nasset classes. Various types of\nsecurities, other assets and\nindexes may experience cycles of\noutperformance and\nunderperformance in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally. This\ndivergence may be due to a number\nof factors including, among other\nthings, inflation, interest\nrates, productivity, global\ndemand for local products or\nresources, and regulation and\ngovernmental controls. This may\ncause a Fund to underperform\nother investment vehicles that\ninvest in different asset\nclasses. Assets Under Management\n(AUM) Risk. From time to time, an\nAuthorized Participant, a third-\nparty investor, a Fund\u2019s adviser,\nan affiliate of a Fund\u2019s adviser,\nor another fund may invest in a\nFund and hold its investment for\na specific period of time to\nallow the Fund to achieve size or\nscale. There can be no assurance\nthat any such entity would not\nredeem its investment or that the\nsize of the Fund would be\nmaintained at such levels, which\ncould negatively impact the Fund.\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number\nof institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the\nFund, including on an agency\nbasis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation\nor redemption orders for the Fund\nand no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk\nmay be heightened for a Fund that\ninvests in securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers or instruments\nwith lower trading volume. Such\nassets often entail greater\nsettlement and operational\ncomplexity and higher capital\ncosts for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the\nnumber of Authorized Participants\nthat engage with the Fund.\nConcentration Risk. A Fund may be\nsusceptible to an increased risk\nof loss, including losses due to\nadverse events that affect the\nFund\u2019s investments more than the\nmarket as a whole, to the extent\nthat the Fund\u2019s investments are\nconcentrated in the securities or\nother assets of one or more\nissuers, countries or other\ngeographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. A Fund with\ninvestment concentration may be\nmore adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets,\nmay experience greater price\nvolatility and may be more\nsusceptible to adverse economic,\nmarket, political or regulatory\nimpacts on those assets compared\nto a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments.\nCurrency Risk. Because the Fund\u2019s\nNAV is determined on the basis of\nthe U.S. dollar, investors may\nlose money if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the\nU.S. dollar or if there are\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof foreign currency, even if the\nforeign currency value of the\nFund\u2019s holdings in that market\nincreases. Currency exchange\nrates can be very volatile and\ncan change quickly and\nunpredictably. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s NAV may change quickly 3\nand without warning. In addition,\nthe Fund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions\nbetween U.S. dollars and foreign\ncurrencies. Cybersecurity Risk. A\nFund and entities that interact\nwith the Fund are susceptible to\noperational, information security\nand related cybersecurity risks,\nboth directly and through their\nservice providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to,\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, distributor,\nother service providers ( e.g .,\nindex and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer\nagents and administrators),\ncounterparties, market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market\noperators, and governmental\nauthorities. Cybersecurity risks\nare also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in\nwhich a Fund invests, which could\nresult in material adverse\nconsequences for such issuers and\nmay cause the Fund\u2019s investment\nin such issuers to lose value.\nCyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or\nunintentional events. They\ninclude, but are not limited to,\ngaining unauthorized access to\nsystems, misappropriating assets\nor sensitive information,\ncorrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational\ndisruption. Geopolitical tensions\nmay increase the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate\nattacks, particularly those from\nnation-states or from entities\nwith nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause\ndisruptions and impact business\noperations and may result in any\nof the following: financial\nlosses, interference with a\nFund\u2019s ability to calculate its\nNAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to\ntrading, submission of erroneous\ntrades or erroneous creation or\nredemption orders, the inability\nof a Fund or its service\nproviders to transact business,\nviolations of applicable privacy\nand other laws, regulatory fines,\npenalties, reputational damage,\nreimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other\nlegal and compliance expenses. In\naddition, cyber incidents may\nrender records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder\nownership of Fund shares, and\nother data integral to a Fund\u2019s\nfunctioning inaccessible,\ninaccurate or incomplete. A Fund\nmay incur substantial costs in\norder to resolve or prevent cyber\nincidents. Each Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent,\ncyber incidents. However, there\nare inherent limitations in such\nplans and systems, including the\npossibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that\nprevention and remediation\nefforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go\nundetected. Furthermore, a Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and\nother third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. A\nFund and its shareholders could\nbe negatively impacted as a\nresult. Equity Securities Risk.\nEquity securities are subject to\nchanges in value due to general\nmarket or economic conditions,\nperceptions about the markets in\nwhich issuers participate or a\nnumber of factors relating to a\nspecific issuer. Investments in\nequity securities may be more\nvolatile than investments in\nother asset classes. Equity\nsecurities (both common and\npreferred stock) are subordinated\nto debt securities in a company\u2019s\ncapital structure, and so equity\nholders are generally subject to\nmore risks, particularly in the\nevent of an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy.\nCommon stock has the lowest\npriority and the greatest risks,\nincluding with respect to\ndividends and any liquidation\npayments. 4 European Economic\nRisk. The Economic and Monetary\nUnion (the \u201c eurozone \u201d ) of the\nEU requires compliance by member\nstates that are members of the\neurozone with restrictions on\ninflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates and debt levels,\nas well as fiscal and monetary\ncontrols, each of which may\nsignificantly affect every\ncountry in Europe, including\nthose countries that are not\nmembers of the eurozone.\nAdditionally, European countries\noutside of the eurozone may\npresent economic risks that are\nindependent of the indirect\neffects that eurozone policies\nhave on them. In particular, the\nU.K.'s economy may be affected by\nglobal economic, industrial and\nfinancial shifts. Changes in\nimports or exports, changes in\ngovernmental or EU regulations on\ntrade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro (the common\ncurrency of eurozone countries),\nthe default or threat of default\nby an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt and/or an economic\nrecession in an EU member state\nmay have a significant adverse\neffect on the economies of other\nEU member states and their\ntrading partners. The European\nfinancial markets have\nhistorically experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic\ndownturns or government debt\nlevels in several European\ncountries, including, but not\nlimited to, Austria, Belgium,\nCyprus, France, Greece, Ireland,\nItaly, Portugal, Spain and\nUkraine. These events have\naffected and may in the future\nadversely affect the exchange\nrate of the euro and may\nsignificantly affect European\ncountries. Responses to financial\nproblems by European governments,\ncentral banks and others,\nincluding austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the\ndesired results, may result in\nsocial unrest, may limit future\ngrowth and economic recovery or\nmay have other unintended\nconsequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt\ncould have additional adverse\neffects on economies, financial\nmarkets and asset valuations\naround the world. In addition,\none or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The U.K. left the EU ( \u201c\nBrexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020.\nBrexit could adversely affect\nEuropean or worldwide political,\nregulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute\nto instability in global\npolitical institutions,\nregulatory agencies and financial\nmarkets. The national politics of\ncountries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to\ninfluence by disruptive political\ngroups and ideologies, including,\nfor example, secessionist\nmovements. The governments of\nEuropean countries may be subject\nto change and such countries may\nexperience social and political\nunrest. Unanticipated or sudden\npolitical or social developments\nmay result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses.\nThe occurrence of terrorist\nincidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region could also\nimpact financial markets. The\nimpact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant\nand far-reaching and could\nadversely affect the value and\nliquidity of the Fund's\ninvestments. Russian Invasion of\nUkraine . Russia launched a\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine\non February 24, 2022. The extent\nand duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market\ndisruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the\nvalue of the ruble against the\nU.S. dollar, are impossible to\npredict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused\nby Russian military action or\nother actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or\nresulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity,\nincluding purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts\nor changes in 5 consumer or\npurchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions,\ntariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian\ncompanies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact\nRussia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which the Fund\ninvests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian\nmilitary action may also impact\nthe markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and\nnatural gas, as well as other\nsectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across\nEurope and globally. Growth\nSecurities Risk. Growth\nsecurities are those issued by\ncompanies whose earnings growth\npotential appears to be greater\nthan the market in general and\nwhose revenue growth is expected\nto continue for an extended\nperiod of time. Growth securities\nmay trade at higher multiples of\ncurrent earnings compared to\nvalue or other stocks, leading to\ninflated prices and thus\npotentially greater declines in\nmarket value. The prices of\ngrowth securities may be more\nvolatile than those of other\ntypes of investments and can\ndecline rapidly and significantly\nin reaction to negative news.\nGrowth securities may\nunderperform value securities and\nother types of assets as well as\nthe overall stock market. Under\ncertain market conditions, growth\nsecurities have performed better\nduring the later stages of\neconomic recovery, although there\nis no assurance that they will\ncontinue to do so. Growth\nsecurities typically do not pay a\ndividend, which can help cushion\nstock prices in market downturns\nand reduce potential losses.\nGrowth securities may go in and\nout of favor over time, which\ncould affect the performance of a\nFund with such holdings.\nHealthcare Companies Risk. The\nprofitability of healthcare\ncompanies may be adversely\naffected by the following\nfactors, among others: extensive\ngovernment regulations,\nrestrictions on government\nreimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing\npressure, a limited number of\nproducts, labor shortages, supply\nchain issues and industry\ninnovation. Many new products in\nthe healthcare sector entail\nsignificant research and\ndevelopment and require\nregulatory approval, all of which\nmay be long and costly, and such\nefforts ultimately may be\nunsuccessful. Many healthcare\ncompanies depend heavily on\nobtaining and defending patents,\nwhich can be costly, and may be\nadversely affected by the\nexpiration of patents. Healthcare\ncompanies also are subject to\nextensive litigation based on\nproduct liability and similar\nclaims. Index-Related Risk. A\nFund that tracks an Underlying\nIndex seeks to achieve a return\nthat corresponds generally to the\nprice and yield performance,\nbefore fees and expenses, of its\nUnderlying Index as published by\nthe Index Provider. There is no\nassurance that the Index Provider\nor its agents will construct or\ncalculate the Underlying Index\naccurately. While the Index\nProvider describes what the\nUnderlying Index is designed to\nachieve, neither the Index\nProvider nor its agents provide\nany warranty or accept any\nliability regarding the quality,\naccuracy or completeness of the\nUnderlying Index or its related\ndata, and they do not guarantee\nthat the Underlying Index will be\nin line with the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology. BFA also does not\nprovide any warranty or guarantee\nagainst the Index Provider\u2019s or\nany agent\u2019s errors. The Index\nProvider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess\nthe criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on\n6 assumptions and estimates.\nNeither a Fund nor BFA can offer\nassurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources\nof information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included\ncomponents. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the\nconstruction of an Underlying\nIndex in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the\nIndex Provider may not identify\nor correct them promptly or at\nall, particularly for indexes\nthat are less commonly used as\nbenchmarks. In addition, there\nmay be heightened risks\nassociated with the adequacy and\nreliability of information about\nemerging markets constituents, as\nsuch markets may have less\ninformation available or less\nregulatory oversight. Errors\nrelated to an Underlying Index\nmay negatively or positively\nimpact a Fund and its\nshareholders. For example, if the\nUnderlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund\nwill have exposure to such\nconstituents and will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s other constituents.\nShareholders should understand\nthat any gains from an Index\nProvider\u2019s errors will be kept by\nthe Fund and its shareholders and\nany losses or costs from such\nerrors will be borne by the Fund\nand its shareholders. Unusual\nmarket conditions or other\nunforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political\nunrest or war) may impact an\nIndex Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to an\nUnderlying Index. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. If a scheduled\nrebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that would otherwise\nbe removed at the rebalance (due\nto, for example, changes in\nmarket capitalization or issuer\ncredit ratings) may remain,\ncausing the performance and\nconstituents of the Underlying\nIndex to vary from those expected\nunder normal conditions. In\naddition, to the extent\ncircumstances evolve between\nperiodic index reviews and\nreconstitutions, an Underlying\nIndex may include constituents\nthat do not align with its\nobjective or selection criteria,\nand the Fund tracking the\nUnderlying Index may be similarly\naffected. In addition to\nscheduled rebalances, an Index\nProvider or its agents may carry\nout ad hoc index rebalances due\nto reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market\nconditions, corporate events, or\ncorrections of errors. The\nrelevant Fund will in turn\nrebalance its portfolio to\nattempt to increase the\ncorrelation between the portfolio\nand the Underlying Index. The\nFund and its shareholders will\ndirectly bear any transaction\ncosts and market exposure from\nsuch portfolio rebalancing.\nTherefore, index-related errors\nand ad hoc rebalances may\nincrease a Fund\u2019s costs and\ntracking error. Issuer Risk. The\nperformance of a Fund depends on\nthe performance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to\nwhich the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other\nassets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the market as a\nwhole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk.\nLarge-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-\ncapitalization companies to adapt\nto changing market conditions and\ncompetitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be\nmore mature and subject to more\nlimited growth potential compared\nwith smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies\ncould trail the overall\nperformance of the broader\nsecurities markets. 7 Large\nShareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders of a Fund, including\nan Authorized Participant, a\nthird-party investor, the Fund\u2019s\nadviser, an affiliate of the\nFund\u2019s adviser, a market maker,\nor another entity, may from time\nto time own or manage a\nsubstantial amount of Fund shares\nor may hold their investment in\nthe Fund for a limited period of\ntime. These shareholders may also\npledge or loan Fund shares (to\nsecure financing or otherwise),\nwhich may result in the shares\nbecoming concentrated in another\nparty. There can be no assurance\nthat any large shareholder or\nlarge group of shareholders would\nnot redeem their investment or\nthat the size of a Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares may\nadversely affect a Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the\nextent a Fund permits redemptions\nin cash, these redemptions may\nforce the Fund to sell portfolio\nsecurities or other assets when\nit might not otherwise do so,\nwhich may negatively impact the\nFund\u2019s NAV, have a material\neffect on the market price of\nFund shares, increase the Fund\u2019s\nbrokerage costs, accelerate the\nrealization of taxable income\nand/or capital gains, and cause\nthe Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders\nearlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under\ncertain circumstances, non-\nredeeming shareholders may be\ntreated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable\ndistribution during or with\nrespect to such tax year. A Fund\nalso may be required to sell its\nmore liquid investments to meet a\nlarge redemption, in which case\nthe Fund\u2019s remaining assets may\nbe less liquid, more volatile,\nand more difficult to price. To\nthe extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund\nshares on the secondary market,\nsuch transactions may account for\na large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may,\ntherefore, have a material upward\nor downward effect on the market\nprice of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares\nmay adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to the extent that\nthe Fund is delayed in investing\nnew cash and is required to\nmaintain a larger cash position\nthan it ordinarily would,\ndiluting its investment returns.\nManagement Risk. The Fund invests\nin securities or other assets\nincluded in, or representative\nof, its Underlying Index,\nregardless of their investment\nmerits. The Fund may be affected\nby a general decline in market\nsegments related to its\nUnderlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to\ninvest the Fund\u2019s assets in\ndefensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including\ndeclining markets. Market\ndisruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an\nadverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nability to adjust its exposure to\nthe required levels in order to\ntrack its Underlying Index.\nBecause BFA uses a representative\nsampling indexing strategy, the\nFund will not fully replicate its\nUnderlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not\nincluded in the Underlying Index.\nAs a result, the Fund is subject\nto the risk that BFA\u2019s investment\nstrategy, whose implementation is\nsubject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the\nintended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of its Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\nRisk. A Fund could lose money\nover short periods due to short-\nterm market movements and over\nlonger periods during more\nprolonged market downturns. The\nvalue of a financial instrument\nor other asset may decline due to\nchanges in general market\nconditions, economic trends or\nevents that are not specifically\nrelated to the 8 particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors\nthat affect one or more issuers,\ncounterparties, exchanges,\ncountries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or\nasset classes. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts\nof terrorism, pandemics or other\npublic health issues, recessions,\nthe prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact\non a Fund and its investments and\ncould result in increased\npremiums or discounts to a Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Changes in market and\neconomic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all\ntypes of instruments and assets.\nMarket Trading Risk. A Fund faces\nnumerous market trading risks,\nany of which may lead to its\nshares trading in the secondary\nmarket at a premium or discount\nto NAV or to the intraday value\nof the Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nIf you buy Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\npremium to NAV or sell Fund\nshares at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to the\nNAV, you may pay significantly\nmore or receive significantly\nless than the underlying value of\nthe Fund shares. Absence of an\nActive Primary Market. Although\nFund shares are listed for\ntrading on one or more stock\nexchanges, there can be no\nassurance that an active primary\ntrading market for Fund shares\nwill develop or be maintained by\nmarket makers or Authorized\nParticipants. Secondary Listing\nRisks. A Fund\u2019s shares may be\nlisted or traded on U.S. and\nnon-U.S. stock exchanges other\nthan the U.S. stock exchange\nwhere the Fund\u2019s primary listing\nis maintained. Fund shares also\nmay be available to non-U.S.\ninvestors through funds or\nstructured investment vehicles\nsimilar to depositary receipts.\nThere can be no assurance that a\nFund\u2019s shares will continue to\ntrade on any such stock exchange\nor in any market or that a Fund\u2019s\nshares will continue to meet the\nrequirements for exchange listing\nor market trading. A Fund\u2019s\nshares may be less actively\ntraded in certain markets than in\nothers, and investors are subject\nto the execution and settlement\nrisks and market standards of the\nmarket where they or their broker\ndirect their trades for\nexecution. Certain information\nthat is available to investors\nwho trade Fund shares on a U.S.\nstock exchange during regular\nU.S. market hours may not be\navailable to investors who trade\nin other markets, which may\nresult in secondary market prices\nin such markets being less\nefficient. Secondary Market\nTrading Risk. Shares of a Fund\nmay trade in the secondary market\nat times when the Fund does not\naccept orders to create or redeem\nshares. At such times, shares may\ntrade in the secondary market\nwith more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might be\nexperienced at times when the\nFund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities\nheld by a Fund may be traded in\nmarkets that close at a different\ntime than an exchange on which\nFund shares are traded. Liquidity\nin those securities may be\nreduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during\nthe time when the exchange is\nopen but after the applicable\nmarket closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be\nwider bid/ask spreads on the\nexchange and a greater premium or\ndiscount to NAV. In stressed\nmarket conditions, the market for\na Fund\u2019s shares may become less\nliquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the\nmarkets for the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings, and an investor may be\nunable to sell their Fund shares.\n9 Secondary market trading in\nFund shares may be halted by a\nstock exchange because of market\nconditions or for other reasons.\nIn times of extraordinary market\nvolatility, Fund shares may be\nsubject to trading halts pursuant\nto \u201c circuit breaker \u201d rules of a\nstock exchange or market. If\nthere is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an\nexchange or market, an investor\nmay be unable to purchase or sell\nFund shares. In addition, if\ntrading in certain securities or\nfinancial instruments is\nrestricted, this may disrupt a\nFund\u2019s creation/redemption\nprocess, affect the price at\nwhich Fund shares trade in the\nsecondary market, and result in a\nFund being unable to trade\ncertain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such\ncircumstances, a Fund may be\nunable to rebalance its portfolio\nor accurately price its portfolio\nholdings and may incur\nsubstantial trading losses.\nShares of a Fund, similar to\nshares of other issuers listed on\na stock exchange, may be sold\nshort and are therefore subject\nto the risk of increased\nvolatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short.\nIn addition, trading activity in\nderivative products based on a\nFund may lead to increased\ntrading volume and volatility in\nthe secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares\nMay Trade at Prices Other Than\nNAV . Shares of a Fund trade on\nstock exchanges at prices at,\nabove or below the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. A Fund\u2019s NAV is\ncalculated at the end of each\nbusiness day and fluctuates with\nchanges in the market value of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nThe trading price of a Fund\u2019s\nshares fluctuates throughout\ntrading hours based on both\nmarket supply of and demand for\nFund shares and the underlying\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the\ntrading prices of a Fund\u2019s shares\nmay deviate significantly from\nNAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant\nredemption requests, or other\nunusual market conditions\nHowever, because Fund shares can\nbe created and redeemed in\nCreation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or\npremiums to a Fund\u2019s NAV are not\nlikely to be sustained over the\nlong term (unlike shares of many\nclosed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While\nthe creation/redemption feature\nis designed to make it more\nlikely that a Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock\nexchanges at prices close to the\nFund\u2019s next calculated NAV,\nexchange prices are not expected\nto correlate exactly with the\nFund\u2019s NAV due to timing reasons,\nsupply and demand imbalances and\nother factors. In addition,\ndisruptions to creations and\nredemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, or other\nmarket participants, and during\nperiods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading\nprices for shares of a Fund that\ndiffer significantly from its\nNAV. Authorized Participants may\nbe less willing to create or\nredeem a Fund\u2019s shares if there\nis a lack of an active market for\nsuch shares or the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying investments, which may\ncontribute to the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or\nSelling Fund Shares. Buying or\nselling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of\ncosts that apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares\nthrough a broker, you will likely\nincur a brokerage commission and\nother charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c\nspread, \u201d which is the difference\nbetween what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares\n(the \u201c bid \u201d price) and the price\nat which they are willing to sell\nFund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price).\nThe spread 10 varies over time\nfor Fund shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity. It\nis generally narrower if a Fund\nhas more trading volume and\nmarket liquidity and wider if a\nFund has less trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. Increased\nmarket volatility also may cause\nwider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other\ncharges that are incurred as a\nresult of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in\nbuying or selling Fund shares,\nfrequent trading may detract\nsignificantly from investment\nresults, and an investment in\nFund shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate\nregularly making small\ninvestments through a brokerage\naccount. National Closed Market\nTrading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held\nby a Fund trade on foreign\nexchanges or in foreign markets\nthat may be closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the\nFund\u2019s shares trade is open,\nthere are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current\nprice and its last quoted price (\ni.e ., the quote from the closed\nforeign market to the Fund). The\nimpact of a closed foreign market\non a Fund is likely to be greater\nwhere a large portion of the\nFund\u2019s holdings trade on a closed\nforeign market or when a foreign\nmarket is closed for unscheduled\nreasons. These deviations could\nresult in premiums or discounts\nto a Fund\u2019s NAV that may be\ngreater than those experienced by\nother funds. Non-Diversification\nRisk. A Fund that is classified\nas \u201c non-diversified \u201d may invest\na greater percentage of its\nassets in securities or other\ninstruments representing a small\nnumber of issuers or\ncounterparties, compared with\nfunds that are classified as \u201c\ndiversified. \u201d A non-diversified\nFund thus may be more susceptible\nto the risks associated with\nthese particular issuers or\ncounterparties. The gains and\nlosses on such holdings may have\na greater impact on a non-\ndiversified Fund\u2019s performance\nthan they would on the\nperformance of a diversified\nFund, and a non-diversified\nFund\u2019s NAV may be more volatile.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk.\nSecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to\ndifferent legal, regulatory,\npolitical, economic, and market\nrisks than securities issued by\nU.S. issuers. To the extent that\na Fund makes investments in a\nlimited number of countries,\nevents in those countries will\nhave a more significant impact on\nthe Fund. The risks of investing\nin non-U.S. securities include\nthe following, any of which may\nhave an adverse impact on a Fund:\n\u25a0 Less liquid markets, which may\nmake valuing securities more\ndifficult; \u25a0 Greater market\nvolatility; \u25a0 Government\nintervention in issuers'\noperations or structure; \u25a0\nGovernment expropriation or\nnationalization of assets; \u25a0\nExchange rate fluctuations and\nexchange controls; \u25a0 Limitations\non foreign ownership of\nsecurities; \u25a0 Imposition of\nwithholding or other taxes; \u25a0\nRestrictions on the repatriation\nof capital; \u25a0 Higher transaction\nand custody costs; \u25a0 Foreign\nmarket trading hours, different\nclearing and settlement\nprocedures, and holiday\nschedules, which may limit a\nFund's ability to engage in\nportfolio transactions; 11 \u25a0 Less\nregulation of the securities and\nother financial markets; \u25a0 Less\navailability of public\ninformation about issuers; \u25a0\nWeaker accounting, audit,\ndisclosure and financial\nreporting requirements and the\nrisk of being delisted from U.S.\nexchanges; \u25a0 Difficulties in\nenforcing contractual\nobligations; and \u25a0 Legal\nprincipals relating to corporate\ngovernance, directors\u2019 fiduciary\nduties and liabilities, and\nshareholder rights that are less\nrobust than those that apply in\nthe U.S. Withholding Tax Reclaims\nRisk . A Fund that holds non-U.S.\nsecurities may file claims to\nrecover withholding tax on\ndividend and interest income (if\nany) received from issuers in\ncertain countries where such\nwithholding tax reclaim is\npossible. Whether or when a Fund\nwill receive a withholding tax\nrefund is within the control of\nthe tax authorities in such\ncountries. Where a Fund expects\nto recover withholding tax based\non a continuous assessment of the\nprobability of recovery, the\nFund\u2019s NAV generally includes\naccruals for such tax refunds.\nFunds continue to evaluate tax\ndevelopments for potential impact\nto the probability of recovery.\nIf the likelihood of receiving a\ntax refund materially decreases,\nsuch as due to a change in tax\nregulation or approach, accruals\nin a Fund\u2019s NAV for such refunds\nmay be written down partially or\nin full, which will adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s NAV. Investors\nin a Fund at the time when an\naccrual is written down will bear\nthe impact of any resulting\nreduction in NAV regardless of\nwhether they were investors\nduring the accrual period.\nConversely, if a Fund receives a\ntax refund that was not\npreviously accrued, investors in\nthe Fund at the time the claim is\nsuccessful will benefit from any\nresulting increase in the Fund\u2019s\nNAV. Investors who sold their\nshares prior to such time will\nnot benefit from any such NAV\nincrease. North American Economic\nRisk . A decrease in imports or\nexports, changes in trade\nregulations or an economic\nrecession in any North American\ncountry can have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire\nNorth American region and on some\nor all of the North American\ncountries in which the Fund\ninvests. The U.S. is Canada's and\nMexico's largest trading and\ninvestment partner. The Canadian\nand Mexican economies are\nsignificantly affected by\ndevelopments in the U.S. economy.\nSince the implementation of the\nNorth American Free Trade\nAgreement ( \u201c NAFTA \u201d ) in 1994\namong Canada, the U.S. and\nMexico, total merchandise trade\namong the three countries has\nincreased. However, political\ndevelopments including the\nimplementation of tariffs by the\nU.S. and the renegotiation of\nNAFTA in the form of the United\nStates-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\n\u201c USMCA \u201d ), which replaced NAFTA\non July 1, 2020, could negatively\naffect North America\u2019s economic\noutlook and, as a result, the\nvalue of securities held by the\nFund. Policy and legislative\nchanges in one country may have a\nsignificant effect on North\nAmerican markets generally, as\nwell as on the value of certain\nsecurities held by the Fund.\nOperational Risk. Each Fund is\nexposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to,\nhuman error, processing and\ncommunication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or\nsystems failures. Each Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\n12 these measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Quality\nSecurities Risk. Securities that\npreviously exhibited greater\nquality characteristics than\nother securities may not continue\nto be quality securities. Many\nfactors can impact a security\u2019s\nquality and performance, and such\nfactors and their impact may be\ndifficult to predict. The returns\nof quality securities may be less\nthan the returns of other styles\nof investing or the overall stock\nmarket. In addition, there may be\nperiods when the quality style of\ninvesting is out of favor, and\nthe investment performance of a\nFund may suffer during such\nperiod. Reliance on Trading\nPartners Risk. The economies of\nsome ACWI countries are dependent\non trading with certain key\ntrading partners. Reduction in\nspending on the products and\nservices of the ACWI countries,\ninstitution of tariffs or other\ntrade barriers by any of their\nkey trading partners or a\nslowdown in the economies of any\nof their key trading partners may\ncause an adverse impact on the\neconomies of the ACWI countries.\nRisk of Investing in China.\nInvestments in Chinese\nsecurities, including certain\nHong Kong-listed and U.S.-listed\nsecurities, subject the Fund to\nrisks specific to China. The\nChinese economy is subject to a\nconsiderable degree of economic,\npolitical and social instability.\nPolitical and Social Risk. The\nChinese government is\nauthoritarian and has\nperiodically used force to\nsuppress civil dissent.\nDisparities of wealth and the\npace of economic liberalization\nmay lead to social turmoil,\nviolence and labor unrest. In\naddition, China continues to\nexperience disagreements related\nto integration with Hong Kong and\nreligious and nationalist\ndisputes in Tibet and Xinjiang.\nThere is also a greater risk in\nChina than in many other\ncountries of currency\nfluctuations, currency non-\nconvertibility, interest rate\nfluctuations and higher rates of\ninflation as a result of internal\nsocial unrest or conflicts with\nother countries. Unanticipated\npolitical or social developments\nmay result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses.\nChina's growing income\ninequality, rapidly aging\npopulation and significant\nenvironmental issues also are\nfactors that may affect the\nChinese economy. Government\nControl and Regulations. The\nChinese government has\nimplemented significant economic\nreforms in order to liberalize\ntrade policy, promote foreign\ninvestment in the economy, reduce\ngovernment control of the economy\nand develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, government control over\ncertain sectors or enterprises\nand significant regulation of\ninvestment and industry is still\npervasive, including restrictions\non investment in companies or\nindustries deemed to be sensitive\nto particular national interests,\ntrading of securities of Chinese\nissuers, foreign ownership of\nChinese corporations and/or the\nrepatriation of assets by foreign\ninvestors. Limitations or\nrestrictions on foreign ownership\nof securities may have adverse\neffects on the liquidity and\nperformance of the Fund and could\nlead to higher tracking error.\nChinese government intervention\nin the market may have a negative\nimpact on market sentiment, which\nmay in turn affect the\nperformance of the Chinese\neconomy and the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. Chinese markets\ngenerally continue to experience\ninefficiency, volatility and\npricing anomalies that may be\nconnected to governmental\ninfluence, lack of publicly\navailable information, and\npolitical and social instability.\nChinese 13 companies, such as\nthose in the financial services\nor technology sectors, and\npotentially other sectors are\nalso subject to the risk that\nChinese authorities can intervene\nin their operations and\nstructure, which may negatively\naffect the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. Economic Risk. The\nChinese economy may be adversely\naffected by, among other things,\na deterioration in global demand\nfor Chinese exports or a\ncontraction in spending on\ndomestic goods by Chinese\nconsumers. In addition, China may\nexperience substantial rates of\ninflation, significant\nindebtedness or economic\nrecessions, which would have a\nnegative effect on its economy\nand securities market. Delays in\nenterprise restructuring, slow\ndevelopment of well-functioning\nfinancial markets and widespread\ncorruption have also hindered the\nperformance of the Chinese\neconomy. China continues to\nreceive substantial pressure from\ntrading partners to liberalize\nofficial currency exchange rates.\nReduction in spending on Chinese\nproducts and services, supply\nchain diversification,\ninstitution of additional\ntariffs, sanctions or other trade\nbarriers (including as a result\nof heightened trade tensions\nbetween China and the U.S. or in\nresponse to actual or alleged\nChinese cyber activity) or a\ndownturn in any of the economies\nof China\u2019s key trading partners\nmay have an adverse impact on the\nChinese economy and companies in\nwhich the Fund invests. Certain\nChinese companies (which may\nchange from time to time) are\ndirectly or indirectly subject to\neconomic or trade restrictions\nimposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments due to national\nsecurity, human rights or other\nconcerns of such government. For\nexample, certain foreign\ntechnology companies are subject\nto U.S. export controls as those\ncompanies are believed to pose a\nrisk to U.S. interests. The U.S.\nalso bans imports of goods\nproduced in certain regions of\nChina or by certain Chinese\ncompanies due to concerns about\nforced labor. Such restrictions\nmay have unanticipated and\nadverse effects on the Chinese\neconomy and companies. Any action\nthat targets Chinese financial\nmarkets or securities exchanges\ncould interfere with orderly\ntrading, delay settlement or\ncause market disruptions. The\nUnderlying Index may include\ncompanies that are subject to\neconomic or trade restrictions\n(but not investment restrictions)\nimposed by the U.S. or other\ngovernments. So long as these\nrestrictions do not include\nrestrictions on investments, the\nFund is generally expected to\ninvest in such companies,\nconsistent with its objective to\ntrack the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Expropriation\nRisk. The Chinese government\nmaintains a major role in\neconomic policymaking, and\ninvesting in China involves risk\nof loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of\nassets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and on\nrepatriation of capital invested.\nSecurity Risk. China has strained\ninternational relations with\nTaiwan, Japan, India, Russia and\nother neighbors due to\nterritorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, defense concerns and\nother security concerns. China\nhas a complex territorial dispute\nregarding the sovereignty of\nTaiwan and has pledged to take\ncontrol of Taiwan, including by\nforce if necessary. The Chinese\nmilitary has conducted military\ndrills around Taiwan in\nconnection with China\u2019s claim to\nTaiwan. Taiwan-based companies\nand individuals are significant\ninvestors in China. These\ntensions between Taiwan and China\nmay adversely affect the Chinese\neconomy. Additionally, China is\nalleged to have 14 participated\nin state-sponsored cyberattacks\nagainst foreign companies and\nforeign governments. Actual and\nthreatened responses to such\nactivity and strained\ninternational relations,\nincluding purchasing\nrestrictions, sanctions, tariffs\nor cyberattacks on the Chinese\ngovernment or Chinese companies,\nmay impact China\u2019s economy and\nChinese issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests. Relations\nbetween China\u2019s Han ethnic\nmajority and other ethnic groups\nin China, including Tibetans and\nUighurs, are also strained and\nhave been marked by protests and\nviolence. These situations may\ncause uncertainty in the Chinese\nmarket and may adversely affect\nthe Chinese economy. In addition,\nconflict on the Korean Peninsula\ncould adversely affect the\nChinese economy. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely\naffect the value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. Chinese Equity\nMarkets. The Fund invests in\nChinese securities, including\nH-shares, A-shares, B-shares,\nRed-Chips and/or P-Chips. The\nissuance of B-shares and H-shares\nby Chinese companies and the\nability to obtain a \u201c back-door\nlisting \u201d through Red-Chips or\nP-Chips is still regarded by the\nChinese authorities as an\nexperiment in economic reform. \u201c\nBack-door listing \u201d is a means by\nwhich a mainland Chinese company\nissues Red-Chips or P-Chips to\nobtain quick access to\ninternational listing and\ninternational capital. These\nshare mechanisms are subject to\nthe political and economic\npolicies in China. Hong Kong\nPolitical Risk. Hong Kong\nreverted to Chinese sovereignty\non July 1, 1997 as a Special\nAdministrative Region ( \u201c SAR \u201d )\nof the People's Republic of China\n( \u201c PRC \u201d ) under the principle\nof \u201c one country, two systems. \u201d\nAlthough China is obligated to\nmaintain the current capitalist\neconomic and social system of\nHong Kong through June 30, 2047,\nthe continuation of economic and\nsocial freedoms enjoyed in Hong\nKong is dependent on the\ngovernment of China. Since 1997,\nthere have been tensions between\nthe Chinese government and many\npeople in Hong Kong who perceive\nChina as tightening control over\nHong Kong\u2019s semi-autonomous\nliberal political, economic,\nlegal and social framework.\nRecent protests and unrest have\nincreased tensions even further.\nDue to the interconnected nature\nof the Hong Kong and Chinese\neconomies, this instability in\nHong Kong may cause uncertainty\nin the Hong Kong and Chinese\nmarkets. In addition, the Hong\nKong dollar trades at a fixed\nexchange rate in relation to (or\nis \u201c pegged \u201d to) the U.S.\ndollar, which has contributed to\nthe growth and stability of the\nHong Kong economy. However, it is\nuncertain how long the currency\npeg will continue or what effect\nthe establishment of an\nalternative exchange rate system\nwould have on the Hong Kong\neconomy. Because the Fund's NAV\nis denominated in U.S. dollars,\nthe establishment of an\nalternative exchange rate system\ncould result in a decline in the\nFund's NAV. Limited Information\nand Legal Remedies . Chinese\ncompanies, including Chinese\ncompanies that are listed on U.S.\nexchanges, are not subject to the\nsame degree of regulatory\nrequirements, accounting\nstandards or auditor oversight as\ncompanies in more developed\ncountries. As a result,\ninformation about the Chinese\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests may be less reliable or\ncomplete. Chinese companies with\nsecurities listed on U.S.\nexchanges may be delisted if they\ndo not meet U.S. accounting\nstandards and auditor oversight\nrequirements, which would\nsignificantly decrease the\nliquidity and value of the\nsecurities. There may be\nsignificant obstacles to\nobtaining 15 information\nnecessary for investigations into\nor litigation against Chinese\ncompanies, and shareholders may\nhave limited legal remedies. The\nFund does not select investments\nbased on investor protection\nconsiderations. Risk of Investing\nin Developed Countries.\nInvestment in developed country\nissuers will subject the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with\ndeveloped countries. Developed\ncountries generally tend to rely\non services sectors ( e.g., the\nfinancial services sector) as the\nprimary means of economic growth.\nA prolonged slowdown in one or\nmore services sectors is likely\nto have a negative impact on\neconomies of certain developed\ncountries, although economies of\nindividual developed countries\ncan be impacted by slowdowns in\nother sectors. In the past,\ncertain developed countries have\nbeen targets of terrorism, and\nsome geographic areas in which\nthe Fund invests have experienced\nstrained international relations\ndue to territorial disputes,\nhistorical animosities, defense\nconcerns and other security\nconcerns. These situations may\ncause uncertainty in the\nfinancial markets in these\ncountries or geographic areas and\nmay adversely affect the\nperformance of the issuers to\nwhich the Fund has exposure.\nHeavy regulation of certain\nmarkets, including labor and\nproduct markets, may have an\nadverse effect on certain\nissuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth\nor cause prolonged periods of\nrecession. Many developed\ncountries are heavily indebted\nand face rising healthcare and\nretirement expenses. In addition,\nprice fluctuations of certain\ncommodities and regulations\nimpacting the import of\ncommodities may negatively affect\ndeveloped country economies. Risk\nof Investing in Saudi Arabia.\nInvesting in Saudi Arabian\nissuers involves legal,\nregulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that\nare specific to Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia is highly reliant on\nincome from the sale of petroleum\nand trade with other countries\ninvolved in the sale of\npetroleum, and its economy is\ntherefore vulnerable to changes\nin foreign currency values and\nthe petroleum market. A sustained\ndecrease in petroleum prices\ncould have a negative impact on\nall aspects of the economy. In\naddition, Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy\nrelies heavily on cheap, foreign\nlabor, and changes in the\navailability of this labor supply\ncould have an adverse effect on\nthe economy. Investments in the\nsecurities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers involve risks not\ntypically associated with\ninvestments in securities of\nissuers in more developed\ncountries, which may negatively\naffect the value of a Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. Such heightened\nrisks may include, among others,\nthe expropriation and/or\nnationalization of assets,\nrestrictions on and government\nintervention in international\ntrade, confiscatory taxation,\npolitical instability, including\nauthoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental\ndecision-making, armed conflict,\ncrime and instability as a result\nof religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. The\ngovernment of Saudi Arabia\nexercises substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private\nsector, and its actions could\nsignificantly impact the value of\nSaudi Arabian securities.\nAlthough some economic reforms (\ne.g., privatization) are\nunderway, restrictions on foreign\nownership persist, and the\ngovernment has an ownership stake\nin many key industries. Saudi\nArabia has experienced strained\nrelations with economic partners\nworldwide, including other\ncountries in the Middle East, due\nto geopolitical events. Economic\nsanctions (or 16 the threat of\nthem) on Saudi Arabian\nindividuals or Saudi Arabian\ncorporate entities may have an\nadverse impact on the Saudi\nArabian economy and securities.\nThe ability of foreign investors\nto invest in the securities of\nSaudi Arabian issuers could be\nrestricted by the Saudi Arabian\ngovernment at any time, and\nunforeseen risks could\nmaterialize with respect to\nforeign ownership of such\nsecurities. In addition, the\nSaudi Arabian government places\ninvestment limitations on the\nownership of Saudi Arabian\nissuers by foreign investors.\nSuch limits may prevent a Fund\nfrom investing in accordance with\nits strategy and result in\ntracking error for a Fund that\ntracks an index. Saudi Arabia\nBroker Risk. There are a number\nof ways to conduct transactions\nin equity securities in the Saudi\nArabian market. A Fund generally\nexpects to transact in a manner\nso that it is not limited by\nSaudi Arabian regulations to a\nsingle broker. However, there may\nbe a limited number of brokers\nwho can provide services to a\nFund, which may have an adverse\nimpact on the prices, quantity or\ntiming of Fund transactions. A\nlimited number of brokers may\nimpact a Fund\u2019s ability to\nachieve best execution on\ntransactions. In addition, a Fund\nmay be more susceptible to credit\nloss or trading disruptions in\nthe event of a default or\nbusiness disruption among the\navailable brokers. If a Fund\u2019s\nuse of a broker is disrupted,\nthere could be an adverse impact\non the Fund\u2019s operations and, if\napplicable, its ability to track\nthe Underlying Index, and the\nFund\u2019s shares could trade at a\npremium or discount to NAV. A\nFund may also incur losses due to\nthe acts or omissions of its\nbrokers in the execution or\nsettlement of transactions or in\nthe transfer of funds or\nsecurities. Risk of Investing in\nthe U.S. Investing in U.S.\nissuers involves legal,\nregulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, and economic risks that\nare specific to the U.S. A\ndecrease in imports or exports,\nchanges in trade regulations,\ninflation, an economic recession,\nfinancial system stress, or\npolitical turmoil, among other\nrisks, may have an adverse effect\non the U.S. economy and the\nsecurities listed on U.S.\nexchanges. The U.S. is also\nsubject to the risk of natural\ndisasters, such as droughts,\nearthquakes, fires and floods.\nU.S. security risks include acts\nof terrorism, internal unrest and\na deterioration in relations\nbetween the U.S. and certain\ncountries. Any of these may\nadversely affect the U.S.\neconomy, financial markets or\nissuers. Governmental agencies\nproject that the U.S. will\nmaintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable\nfuture. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily\nindicate or cause economic\nproblems, the costs of servicing\nsuch debt may constrain future\neconomic growth. Circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or\nprincipal on U.S. government\ndebt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system.\nSecurities Lending Risk. A Fund\nmay engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the\nrisk that a Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return\nthe securities in a timely manner\nor at all. A Fund could also lose\nmoney in the event of a decline\nin the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or\na decline in the value of any\ninvestments made with cash\ncollateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for a Fund. 17 Small\nFund Risk. When a Fund\u2019s size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience\nlow trading volume and wide\nbid/ask spreads. In addition, a\nFund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if it does not meet\ncertain requirements set by the\nlisting exchange. If a Fund were\nrequired to delist from the\nlisting exchange, the Fund\u2019s\nvalue may rapidly decline and its\nperformance may be negatively\nimpacted. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could\nlead to elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its\nshareholders. Technology\nCompanies Risk. Technology\ncompanies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances\nmay have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources and\npersonnel. These companies may\nface rapid product obsolescence\nas well as unexpected risks and\ncosts related to new product\nintroduction and technological\ndevelopments, such as artificial\nintelligence and machine\nlearning. Technology companies\nmay be adversely affected by\ndisruptions to supply chains and\ndistribution networks as well as\nissues at third-party partners.\nThey are heavily dependent on\npatent and other intellectual\nproperty rights, and the loss or\nimpairment of these rights may\nadversely affect their\nprofitability. Technology\ncompanies may face increased\ngovernment scrutiny and may be\nsubject to adverse government or\nlegal action. These companies\nalso may be adversely affected\nby, among other things, actual or\nperceived security\nvulnerabilities or other defects\nin their products and services,\nwhich may result in lawsuits,\ngovernment enforcement actions\nand other remediation costs.\nTracking Error Risk. A Fund that\ntracks an index is subject to the\nrisk of \u201c tracking error, \u201d which\nis the divergence of a Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error\nmay occur due to a number of\nfactors, including differences\nbetween the securities and other\nassets held in a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nand those included in the\nUnderlying Index; differences in\nthe timing and methodologies used\nto value securities and other\nassets; transaction costs and\nother expenses incurred by a Fund\nthat the Underlying Index does\nnot incur; a Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash; differences in\nthe timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by a Fund or\ndistributions paid to Fund\nshareholders; tax gains or\nlosses; the requirements for a\nFund to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment; portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders; the acceptance of\ncustom baskets; changes to the\nUnderlying Index, such as during\na rebalancing or reconstitution;\nand impacts to a Fund of\ncomplying with certain regulatory\nrequirements or limits. A Fund\nthat tracks an index composed of\na large number of securities or\nother assets may experience\ngreater tracking error than a\nFund that tracks a more narrow\nindex. Tracking error risk may be\nheightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nValuation Risk. The price that a\nFund could receive upon the sale\n(or other disposition) of a\nsecurity or other asset may\ndiffer from the Fund\u2019s valuation\nof the security or other asset,\nparticularly for securities or\nother assets that trade in low\nvolume or volatile markets or\nthat are valued using a fair\nvalue methodology. The price\nreceived by a Fund also may\ndiffer from the value used by the\nUnderlying Index (if applicable).\nBecause non-U.S. exchanges or\nmarkets may be open on days or\nduring time periods when a Fund\ndoes not price its shares, the\nvalue of the securities or other\n18 assets in a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nmay change on days or during time\nperiods when investors are not\nable to purchase or sell Fund\nshares. In addition, for purposes\nof calculating a Fund's NAV, the\nvalue of assets denominated in\nnon-U.S. currencies (if any) is\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at\nthe prevailing market rates. For\na Fund that tracks an Underlying\nIndex, this may result in a\ndifference between the prices\nused to calculate the Fund's NAV\nand the prices used by the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn,\ncould result in a difference\nbetween the Fund's performance\nand the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Authorized\nParticipants that create or\nredeem Fund shares on days when a\nFund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or\nlower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities or\nother assets not been fair valued\nor been valued using a different\nmethodology. The ability to value\ninvestments may be impacted by\ntechnological issues or errors by\npricing services or other third-\nparty service providers. Other\nRisks The order of the below risk\nfactors does not indicate the\nsignificance of any particular\nrisk factor. Close-Out Risk for\nQualified Financial Contracts.\nRegulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require\ncounterparties that are part of\nU.S. or foreign global\nsystemically important banking\norganizations to include\ncontractual restrictions on\nclose-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified\nfinancial contracts. Qualified\nfinancial contracts include\nagreements relating to swaps,\ncurrency forwards and other\nderivatives as well as repurchase\nagreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions\nprevent a Fund from closing out a\nqualified financial contract\nduring a specified time period if\nthe counterparty is subject to\nresolution proceedings and also\nprohibit a Fund from exercising\ndefault rights due to a\nreceivership or similar\nproceeding of an affiliate of the\ncounterparty. These requirements\nmay increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund.\nCommunication Services Sector\nRisk. The communication services\nsector consists of both companies\nin the telecommunication services\nindustry as well as those in the\nmedia and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the\ntelecommunication services\nindustry group include providers\nof fiber-optic, fixed-line,\ncellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks.\nCompanies in the media and\nentertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services\nand products including television\nbroadcasting, gaming products,\nsocial media, networking\nplatforms, online classifieds,\nonline review websites, and\nInternet search engines.\nCompanies in the communication\nservices sector may be affected\nby industry competition,\nsubstantial capital requirements,\ngovernment regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications\nproducts and services due to\ntechnological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and\ninternational demand, shifting\ndemographics and often\nunpredictable changes in consumer\ntastes can drastically affect a\ncommunication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while\nall companies may be susceptible\nto network security breaches,\ncertain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may\nbe particular targets of hacking\nand potential theft of\nproprietary or consumer\ninformation or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their\nbusinesses. 19 The communication\nservices sector of a country\u2019s\neconomy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation.\nThe costs of complying with\ngovernmental regulations, delays\nor failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the\nenactment of new regulatory\nrequirements may negatively\naffect the business of\ncommunications companies.\nGovernment actions around the\nworld, specifically in the area\nof pre-marketing clearance of\nproducts and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry\ncan also be significantly\naffected by intense competition\nfor market share, including\ncompetition with alternative\ntechnologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product\ncompatibility and\nstandardization, consumer\npreferences, rapid product\nobsolescence, research and\ndevelopment of new products, lack\nof standardization or\ncompatibility with existing\ntechnologies, and a dependency on\npatent and copyright protections.\nCompanies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter\ndistressed cash flows due to the\nneed to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing\ncompetition, particularly in\ndeveloping new products and\nservices using new technology.\nTechnological innovations may\nmake the products and services of\ncertain communications companies\nobsolete. Telecommunications\nproviders with exposure to the\nU.S. are generally required to\nobtain franchises or licenses in\norder to provide services in a\ngiven location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the\ntelecommunications sector are\nlimited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain\nparticipants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high\nbarriers to market entry and\nregulatory oversight, among other\nfactors, have led to\nconsolidation of companies within\nthe sector, which could lead to\nfurther regulation or other\nnegative effects in the future.\nTelecommunication providers\ninvesting in non-U.S. countries\nmay be subject to similar risks.\nAdditional risks include those\nrelated to competitive challenges\nin the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic\njoint ventures with U.S.\ncompanies and in non-U.S. markets\nfrom both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment\nindustries can be significantly\naffected by several factors,\nincluding competition,\nparticularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new\ntechnologies, cyclicality of\nrevenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the\ndiscretionary income of targeted\nindividuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the\npotential increase in government\nregulation. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment\nindustries may become obsolete\nquickly. Advertising spending can\nbe an important revenue source\nfor media and entertainment\ncompanies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending\ntypically decreases and, as a\nresult, media and entertainment\ncompanies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Consumer Goods and\nServices Companies Risk. Many\nconsumer goods and services\ncompanies ( \u201c consumer companies\n\u201d ) rely heavily on disposable\nhousehold income and consumer\nspending and may be impacted by\nsocial trends, marketing\ncampaigns, demographic shifts and\nother factors affecting consumer\npreferences and demand. In\naddition, damage to a brand or a\nreputation crisis can have a\nsubstantial adverse impact on\nconsumer companies. Certain\nconsumer companies, such as those\nproviding discretionary goods or\nservices, may depend more on\nbusiness cycles, overall economic\nconditions and consumer 20\nconfidence. Many consumer goods\nand services are subject to\ngovernment regulation and the\nrelated compliance costs, and\nconsumer companies also face the\nrisk of product liability claims.\nConsumer companies also may be\nadversely affected by volatility\nin commodity prices, supply chain\ndisruptions and labor shortages.\nCustody Risk. Custody risk refers\nto the risks in the process of\nclearing and settling trades, as\nwell as the holding of securities\nand other assets by local banks,\nagents and depositories. These\nrisks are heightened in\njurisdictions with less developed\nmarkets or less robust settlement\nand custody infrastructure and\nprocesses, and they may result in\nlosses or delays in payments,\ndelivery or recovery of money or\nother assets. Low trading volumes\nand volatile prices in less\ndeveloped markets may make trades\nharder to complete and settle.\nGovernments or trade groups may\ncompel local agents to hold\nsecurities and other assets in\ndesignated depositories that may\nnot be subject to independent\nevaluation. Local agents are held\nonly to the standards of care of\ntheir local markets. In general,\nthe less developed a country\u2019s\nsecurities markets are, the\nhigher the degree of custody\nrisk. Financial Companies Risk.\nFinancial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental\nregulation and intervention,\nwhich may change frequently and\nmay adversely affect their\nprofitability, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can\ncharge, the amount of capital and\nliquid assets they must maintain\nand their size, among other\nthings. Financial services\ncompanies also may be\nsignificantly affected by, among\nother things, interest rates,\neconomic conditions, credit\nrating downgrades, adverse public\nperception and exposure\nconcentration. Increased risk-\ntaking by financial companies may\nresult in greater overall risk in\nthe global financial sector.\nCertain events may cause an\nunusually high degree of\nvolatility in financial markets\nand pose the risk of large losses\nfor financial services companies.\nFinancial companies frequently\noperate with substantial\nfinancial leverage and are\nexposed directly to the credit\nrisk of their borrowers and\ncounterparties, which also may be\nleveraged to an unknown degree.\nFinancial companies may have\nsignificant exposure to the same\nborrowers and counterparties; as\na result, a borrower\u2019s or\ncounterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company\nmay affect other financial\ncompanies with exposure to the\nsame borrower or counterparty.\nThis interconnectedness of risk\nmay result in significant\nnegative impacts to companies\nwith direct exposure to the\ndefaulting counterparty as well\nas adverse cascading effects in\nthe markets and the financial\nsector generally. Geographic and\nSecurity Risks. Issuers in a\nFund\u2019s portfolio may be located\nin, or otherwise connected to,\nparts of the world affected by\nnatural disasters, such as severe\nheat, earthquakes, tornadoes,\nvolcanic eruptions, wildfires,\ndroughts, floods, hurricanes and\ntsunamis. In addition, issuers\nmay be impacted by security\nconcerns with respect to a\ncountry or region, such as war\nand other types of conflict,\nterrorism, strained international\nrelations and territorial\ndisputes. Any of these events may\nadversely affect the issuers,\nmarkets and economies to which a\nFund is exposed, which may\nadversely affect the value of the\nFund. Illiquid Investments Risk.\nThe Fund may not acquire any\nilliquid investment if,\nimmediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have\ninvested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments.\nAn illiquid investment is any\ninvestment that the 21 Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold\nor disposed of in current market\nconditions in seven calendar days\nor less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the\ninvestment. Liquid investments\nmay become illiquid after\npurchase by the Fund,\nparticularly during periods of\nmarket turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or\ninstrument that is deemed to be\nliquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long\nas it is held by the Fund, and\nany security or instrument held\nby the Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to\nthe Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent\nthe Fund holds illiquid\ninvestments, the illiquid\ninvestments may reduce the\nreturns of the Fund because the\nFund may be unable to transact at\nadvantageous times or prices. An\ninvestment may be illiquid due\nto, among other things, the\nreduced number and capacity of\ntraditional market participants\nto make a market in securities or\ninstruments, the lack of an\nactive market for such securities\nor instruments, capital controls,\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof local currency, or insolvency\nof local governments. To the\nextent that the Fund invests in\nsecurities or instruments with\nsubstantial market and/or credit\nrisk, the Fund will tend to have\nincreased exposure to the risks\nassociated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid investments\nmay be harder to value,\nespecially in changing markets.\nIf the Fund is forced to sell\nunderlying investments at reduced\nprices or under unfavorable\nconditions to meet redemption\nrequests or for other cash needs,\nthe Fund may suffer a loss. This\nmay be magnified in a rising\ninterest rate environment or\nother circumstances where\nredemptions from the Fund may be\ngreater than normal. Other market\nparticipants may be attempting to\nliquidate holdings at the same\ntime as the Fund, causing\nincreased supply of the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying investments in the\nmarket and contributing to\nilliquid investments risk and\ndownward pricing pressure. In\naddition, if the Fund is limited\nin its ability to sell illiquid\ninvestments during periods when\nshareholders are redeeming their\nshares, the Fund will need to\nsell liquid securities to meet\nredemption requests and illiquid\nsecurities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings.\nDuring periods of market\nvolatility, liquidity in the\nmarket for the Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe impacted by the liquidity in\nthe market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by\nthe Fund, which could lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a\npremium or discount to the Fund's\nNAV. Industrial Companies Risk.\nIndustrial companies face a\nnumber of risks, including supply\nchain and distribution\ndisruptions, business\ninterruptions, third-party vendor\nrisks, cyber attacks, trade\ndisputes, product recalls,\nliability and environmental\ndamage claims, scarcity of\nmaterials or parts, excess\ncapacity, changes in consumer\npreferences, and volatility in\ncommodity prices and currencies.\nThe products of industrial\ncompanies may face obsolescence\ndue to technological developments\nand new product introduction.\nFurthermore, changes in trade\nrestrictions and tariffs as well\nas broader geopolitical\ndevelopments could adversely\naffect industrial companies.\nThese companies also may be\nsignificantly affected by\ndomestic and international\neconomic conditions, legislative\nand regulatory changes, and labor\nrelations. Industrial companies\nmay depend on public or private\nsector financing, which may\nbecome difficult to obtain due to\ngovernment spending constraints\nor reduced availability of\ncapital. Such companies may be\nunable to protect their\nintellectual property rights or\nmay be liable for infringing the\nintellectual property rights of\nothers. 22 Issuers with high\ncarbon intensity or high\nswitching costs associated with\nthe transition to low carbon\nalternatives may be more impacted\nby climate transition risks.\nThere may be increased impact on\na Fund's performance to the\nextent that its investments are\nconcentrated in locations that\nare more susceptible to adverse\nphysical events. Mid-\nCapitalization Companies Risk.\nInvestments in mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be riskier, less\nliquid, more volatile and more\nsusceptible to economic, market\nand industry changes than\ninvestments in large-\ncapitalization companies. Mid-\ncapitalization companies may have\nmore limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources and\nmanagement experience. As a\nresult, they generally are more\nvulnerable than large-\ncapitalization companies to\nadverse business and economic\ndevelopments. Mid-capitalization\ncompanies may have a shorter\nbusiness track record, with\nrelatively less information\navailable to investors. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies\nmay trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than the\nsecurities of larger companies.\nRisk of Investing in Emerging\nMarkets. Investments in emerging\nmarket issuers are subject to a\ngreater risk of loss than\ninvestments in issuers located or\noperating in more developed\nmarkets. This is due to, among\nother things, the potential for\ngreater market volatility, lower\ntrading volume, higher levels of\ninflation, social, political or\neconomic instability, greater\nrisk of a market shutdown and\nmore governmental limitations on\nforeign investments in emerging\nmarket countries than are\ntypically found in more developed\nmarkets. Some countries in which\nthe Fund may invest may\nexperience economic instability,\nincluding instability resulting\nfrom substantial rates of\ninflation or significant\ndevaluations of their currency,\nor economic recessions, which\nwould have a negative effect on\nthe economies and securities\nmarkets of their economies. Some\nof these countries may also\nimpose restrictions on the\nexchange or export of currency or\nadverse currency exchange rates\nand may be characterized by a\nlack of available currency\nhedging instruments. Disparities\nof wealth, the pace and success\nof democratization and ethnic,\nreligious and racial\ndisaffection, among other\nfactors, may exacerbate social\nunrest, violence and labor unrest\nin some of the countries in which\nthe Fund may invest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political\nor social developments may result\nin sudden and significant\ninvestment losses. Companies in\nmany emerging markets are not\nsubject to the same degree of\nregulatory requirements,\naccounting standards or auditor\noversight as companies in more\ndeveloped countries, and as a\nresult, information about the\nsecurities in which the Fund\ninvests may be less reliable or\ncomplete. Moreover, emerging\nmarkets often have less reliable\nsecurities valuations and greater\nrisks associated with custody of\nsecurities than developed\nmarkets. There may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining\ninformation necessary for\ninvestigations into or litigation\nagainst companies and\nshareholders may have limited\nlegal remedies. The Fund is not\nactively managed and does not\nselect investments based on\ninvestor protection\nconsiderations. In addition,\nemerging markets often have\ngreater risk of capital controls\nthrough such measures as taxes or\ninterest rate control than\ndeveloped markets. Certain\nemerging market countries may\nalso lack the infrastructure\nnecessary to attract large\namounts 23 of foreign trade and\ninvestment. Chronic structural\npublic sector deficits in some\ncountries in which the Fund may\ninvest may adversely impact\nsecurities held by the Fund.\nLocal securities markets in\nemerging market countries may\ntrade a small number of\nsecurities and may be unable to\nrespond effectively to changes in\ntrading volume, potentially\nmaking prompt liquidation of\nholdings difficult or impossible\nat times. Settlement procedures\nin emerging market countries are\nfrequently less developed and\nreliable than those in the U.S.\n(and other developed countries).\nIn addition, significant delays\nmay occur in certain markets in\nregistering the transfer of\nsecurities. Settlement or\nregistration problems may make it\nmore difficult for the Fund to\nvalue its portfolio securities\nand could have an adverse effect\non the Fund in seeking to achieve\nits investment objective. There\ncould be additional impacts on\nthe value of the Fund as a result\nof sustainability risks, in\nparticular those caused by\nenvironmental changes related to\nclimate change, social issues\n(including relating to labor\nrights) and governance risk\n(including but not limited to\nrisks around board independence,\nownership and control, or audit\nand tax management).\nAdditionally, disclosures or\nthird-party data coverage\nassociated with sustainability\nrisks is generally less available\nor transparent in these markets.\nAs a result, investments in\ncertain countries in which the\nFund may invest may be subject to\nloss due to expropriation or\nnationalization of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of\nrestrictions on foreign\ninvestments and repatriation of\ncapital.\nThreshold/Underinvestment Risk.\nIf certain aggregate and/or fund-\nlevel ownership thresholds are\nreached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates\nor a Fund, or as a result of\nthird-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or\nregulator, the ability of BFA and\nits affiliates on behalf of\nclients (including a Fund) to\npurchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or\nundertake business transactions\nmay be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. The\ncapacity of a Fund to invest in\ncertain securities or other\nassets may be affected by the\nrelevant threshold limits, and\nsuch limitations may have adverse\neffects on the liquidity and\nperformance of a Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings. To the extent a Fund\ntracks an index, such limits may\nincrease the risk of the Fund\nbeing underinvested in an asset\nrelative to its Underlying Index\nand increase the risk of tracking\nerror. For example, ownership\nlimits may apply to securities\nwhose issuers operate in certain\nregulated industries or in\ncertain international markets.\nSuch limits also may apply where\nthe investing entity (such as a\nFund) is subject to corporate or\nregulatory ownership restrictions\nor invests in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate\nand/or fund-level amounts\ninvested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts\n(including a Fund) may not exceed\nthe relevant limits without the\ngrant of a license or other\nregulatory or corporate consent.\nIn other cases, exceeding such\nthresholds may cause BFA and its\naffiliates, a Fund or other\nclient accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business\nrestrictions. 24 Portfolio\nHoldings Information A\ndescription of the policies and\nprocedures with respect to the\ndisclosure of the Funds\u2019\nportfolio securities and other\nassets (as applicable) is\navailable in the applicable\nStatement of Additional\nInformation ( \u201c SAI \u201d ). Each\nFund discloses its portfolio\nholdings daily at\nwww.iShares.com. Fact sheets\nproviding information about each\nFund\u2019s top holdings are posted on\nwww.iShares.com when available\nand may be requested by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\nManagement of the Fund Investment\nAdviser As investment adviser,\nBFA has overall responsibility\nfor the general management and\nadministration of the Funds. BFA\nprovides an investment program\nfor the Funds and manages the\ninvestment of the Funds\u2019 assets.\nIn seeking to achieve the Funds\u2019\nrespective investment objectives,\nBFA uses teams of portfolio\nmanagers, investment strategists\nand other investment specialists\nand may draw upon the trading,\nresearch and expertise of its\naffiliates. This team approach\nbrings together many disciplines\nand leverages BFA\u2019s extensive\nresources. BFA is an indirect\nwholly owned subsidiary of\nBlackRock, Inc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand is located at 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105.\nAs of September 30, 2024, BFA and\nits affiliates provided\ninvestment advisory services for\nassets of approximately $11.5\ntrillion. From time to time, an\nemployee of BlackRock may express\nviews regarding a particular\nsecurity or other instrument,\nasset class, company, industry,\nor market sector. Such views are\nthe views of only that individual\nas of the time expressed. They do\nnot necessarily represent the\nviews of BlackRock or any other\nperson within the BlackRock\norganization. Such views may\nchange at any time based upon\nmarket or other conditions, and\nBlackRock has no responsibility\nto update such views. You should\nnot rely on any such views as\ninvestment advice or as an\nindication of trading intent on\nbehalf of a Fund. Fees and\nExpenses Pursuant to the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nbetween BFA and the Trust\n(entered into on behalf of the\nFunds), BFA is responsible for\nsubstantially all expenses of the\nFund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition\nof portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses\nand any extraordinary expenses\n(as determined by a majority of\nthe Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the\nTrust). Operating expenses paid\nby BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude\nacquired fund fees and expenses,\nif any. A discussion regarding\nthe basis for the approval by the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201c\nBoard \u201d ) of the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement with BFA will\nbe available in the Fund's Form\nN-CSR filed with the SEC for the\nperiod ending February 28 and in\nthe applicable financial\nstatements posted at\nwww.iShares.com. 25\n\nFor its investment advisory\nservices to the Fund, BFA is paid\na management fee from the Fund,\nas a percentage of the Fund\u2019s\naverage daily net assets, net of\nany applicable waivers, at the\nannual rate set forth in the\ntable below. If BFA has\ncontractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fees\nfor a Fund, the contractual\nwaiver may be terminated prior to\nits expiration date only upon\nwritten agreement of the Trust\nand BFA. In addition, BFA may\nfrom time to time voluntarily\nwaive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce a Fund\u2019s total\nannual fund operating expenses\n(excluding acquired fund fees and\nexpenses, if any). Any such\nvoluntary waiver or reimbursement\nmay be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime.\n                                              \n  Fund                        Management Fee  \n  iShares MSCI Global         0.20%1          \n  Quality Factor ETF                          \n                                              \n1 BFA has contractually agreed to\nwaive a portion of its management\nfees in an amount equal to the\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nif any, attributable to\ninvestments by the Fund in other\nregistered investment companies\nadvised by BFA, or its\naffiliates, through December 31,\n2029. The contractual waiver may\nbe terminated prior to December\n31, 2029 only upon written\nagreement of the Trust and BFA.\nPortfolio Managers The Portfolio\nManagers for the Fund are\nresponsible for various functions\nrelated to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninvesting cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of\ntheir respective portfolio\nmanagement teams to focus on\ncertain asset classes,\nimplementing investment strategy,\nresearching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and\noverseeing members of their\nrespective teams who have more\nlimited responsibilities.\nJennifer Hsui, Greg Savage and\nPaul Whitehead are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. Jennifer\nHsui has been employed by BFA or\nits affiliates as a senior\nportfolio manager since 2007. She\nis a Managing Director of\nBlackRock, Inc.

BFA and its\nAffiliates are involved worldwide\nwith a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset\nmanagement activities and in the\nordinary course of business may\nengage in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests\nof other clients may conflict\nwith those of a Fund. BFA and its\nAffiliates act, or may act, as an\ninvestor, research provider,\ninvestment manager, commodity\npool operator, commodity trading\nadvisor, financier, underwriter,\nadviser, trader, lender, index\nprovider, agent and/or principal.\nBFA and its Affiliates may have\nother direct and indirect\ninterests in securities,\ncurrencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other assets in\nwhich a Fund may directly or\nindirectly invest. BFA and its\nAffiliates may engage in\nproprietary trading and advise\naccounts and other funds that\nhave investment objectives\nsimilar to those of a Fund and/or\nthat engage in and compete for\ntransactions in the same or\nsimilar types of securities,\ncurrencies and other assets as\nare held by a Fund. This may\ninclude transactions in\nsecurities issued by other open-\nend and closed-end investment\ncompanies, including investment\ncompanies that are affiliated\nwith the Fund and BFA, to the\nextent permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940,\nas amended (the \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ).\nThe trading activities of BFA and\nits Affiliates are carried out\nwithout reference to positions\nheld directly or indirectly by a\nFund. These activities may result\nin BFA or an Affiliate having\npositions in assets that are\nsenior or junior to, or that have\ninterests different from or\nadverse to, the assets held by a\nFund. A Fund may invest in\nsecurities issued by, or engage\nin other transactions with,\nentities with which an Affiliate\nhas significant debt or equity\ninvestments or other interests. A\nFund may also invest in issuances\n(such as debt offerings or\nstructured notes) for which an\nAffiliate is compensated for\nproviding advisory, cash\nmanagement or other services. A\nFund also may invest in\nsecurities of, or engage in other\ntransactions with, entities for\nwhich an Affiliate provides or\nmay provide research coverage or\nother analysis. An Affiliate may\nhave business relationships with,\nand receive compensation from,\ndistributors, consultants or\nothers who recommend a Fund or\nwho engage in transactions with\nor for a Fund.\n\n27\n\nNeither BlackRock nor any\nAffiliate is under any obligation\nto share any investment\nopportunity, idea or strategy\nwith a Fund. As a result, an\nAffiliate may compete with a Fund\nfor appropriate investment\nopportunities. The results of a\nFund\u2019s investment activities,\ntherefore, may differ from those\nof an Affiliate and of other\naccounts managed by an Affiliate.\nIt is possible that a Fund could\nsustain losses during periods in\nwhich one or more Affiliates and\nother accounts achieve profits on\ntheir trading for proprietary or\nother accounts. The opposite\nresult is also possible. In\naddition, a Fund may enter into\ntransactions in which BFA or an\nAffiliate or their directors,\nofficers, employees or clients\nhave an adverse interest. A Fund\nmay be adversely impacted by the\neffects of transactions\nundertaken by BFA or an Affiliate\nor their directors, officers,\nemployees or clients. From time\nto time, BlackRock or its\nadvisory clients (including other\nfunds and accounts) may, subject\nto compliance with applicable\nlaw, purchase and hold shares of\na Fund. The price, availability,\nliquidity, and (in some cases)\nexpense ratio of a Fund may be\nimpacted by purchases and sales\nof the Fund by BlackRock or its\nadvisory clients. A Fund\u2019s\nactivities may be limited because\nof regulatory restrictions\napplicable to BFA or an Affiliate\nor their policies designed to\ncomply with such restrictions.\nUnder a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board,\nthe Funds have retained BTC, an\nAffiliate of BFA, to serve as\ntheir securities lending agent to\nthe extent that they participate\nin the securities lending\nprogram. For these services, the\nsecurities lending agent will\nreceive a fee from the\nparticipating Fund based on the\nreturns earned on the Fund\u2019s\nlending activities, including\ninvestment of the cash received\nas collateral for the loaned\nsecurities. In addition, one or\nmore Affiliates may be among the\nentities to which a Fund may lend\nits portfolio securities under\nthe securities lending program.\nUnder an ETF Services Agreement,\ncertain Funds have retained\nBlackRock Investments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an\nAffiliate of BFA, to perform\ncertain order processing,\nAuthorized Participant\ncommunications, and related\nservices in connection with the\nissuance and redemption of\nCreation Units ( \u201c ETF Services \u201d\n). BRIL will retain a portion of\nthe standard transaction fee\nreceived from Authorized\nParticipants on each creation or\nredemption order from the\nAuthorized Participant for the\nETF Services provided. BlackRock\ncollaborated with, and received\npayment from, Citibank, N.A. ( \u201c\nCitibank \u201d ) on the design and\ndevelopment of the ETF Services\nplatform. Citibank may have, or\nfrom time to time may develop,\nadditional relationships with\nBlackRock or funds managed by BFA\nand its Affiliates. BlackRock and\nits Affiliates may benefit from a\nFund using a BlackRock index by\ncreating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indexes.\nBlackRock and its Affiliates are\nnot obligated to license an index\nto a Fund, and no Fund is under\nan obligation to use a BlackRock\nindex. The terms of a Fund\u2019s\nindex licensing agreement with\nBlackRock or its Affiliates may\nnot be as favorable as the terms\noffered to other licensees. The\nactivities of BFA and its\nAffiliates and their respective\ndirectors, officers or employees\nmay give rise to other conflicts\nof interest that could\ndisadvantage a Fund 28 and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted\npolicies and procedures designed\nto address these potential\nconflicts of interest. Please see\nthe SAI for further information.\nShareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy\nand sell shares of the Funds, is\navailable free of charge by\ncalling toll-free 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting\nwww.iShares.com. Buying and\nSelling Shares Transactions in\nshares of the Funds occur in the\nprimary market and the secondary\nmarket. Primary market\ntransactions, known as \u201c\ncreations \u201d and \u201c redemptions, \u201d\noccur only between the Funds and\nAuthorized Participants ( i.e .,\nfinancial institutions that are\nauthorized to participate in such\ntransactions), as described in\nthe Creations and Redemptions\nsection below. Fund shares are\nlisted on U.S. national\nsecurities exchanges, where they\ncan be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day at market prices,\nlike shares of other publicly\ntraded companies. A Fund\u2019s shares\nmay also be available in other\nsecondary markets, such as on\nnon-U.S. exchanges and through\nfunds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary\nreceipts. The Funds do not impose\nany minimum investment for Fund\nshares purchased on an exchange\nor otherwise in the secondary\nmarket. Buying or selling Fund\nshares on an exchange or other\nsecondary market generally\ninvolves two types of costs that\nare common in securities\ntransactions. First, when buying\nor selling Fund shares through a\nbroker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission and other charges. The\ncommission is frequently a fixed\namount; it may be a significant\nproportional cost if you are\nseeking to buy or sell small\namounts of shares. Second, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c\nspread, \u201d which is any difference\nbetween the bid price and the ask\nprice for the shares. The spread\nvaries over time based on a\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market\nliquidity. Generally, the spread\nis smaller if a Fund has high\ntrading volume and market\nliquidity, and larger if a Fund\nhas lower trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. The latter is\noften the case for newly launched\nor smaller funds. A Fund\u2019s spread\nmay also be impacted by the\nliquidity (or lack thereof) of\nthe underlying securities or\nother assets held by the Fund,\nparticularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds, or by instances\nof significant volatility of the\nunderlying assets. The U.S.\nnational securities exchanges\nthat list Fund shares are open\nfor trading Monday through Friday\nand are closed on weekends and\nthe following holidays (or the\ndays on which they are observed):\nNew Year\u2019s Day, Martin Luther\nKing, Jr. Day, Presidents\u2019 Day,\nGood Friday, Memorial Day,\nJuneteenth, Independence Day,\nLabor Day, Thanksgiving Day and\nChristmas Day. Investments in\nInvestment Companies Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments\nby investment companies,\nincluding foreign and\nunregistered investment\ncompanies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For\nexample, a registered investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Funds, may not\nknowingly sell or otherwise\ndispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any\ninvestment company (the \u201c\nAcquiring 29 Fund \u201d ) or any\ncompany or companies controlled\nby the Acquiring Fund if,\nimmediately after such sale or\ndisposition: (i) more than 3% of\nthe total outstanding voting\nstock of the Acquired Fund is\nowned by the Acquiring Fund and\nany company or companies\ncontrolled by the Acquiring Fund,\nor (ii) more than 10% of the\ntotal outstanding voting stock of\nthe Acquired Fund is owned by the\nAcquiring Fund and other\ninvestment companies and\ncompanies controlled by them.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing,\nregistered investment companies\nare permitted to invest in a Fund\nbeyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to\ncertain terms and conditions set\nforth in Rule 12d1-4 under the\n1940 Act. To make such an\ninvestment in an Acquired Fund, a\nregistered investment company\nmust, among other things, enter\ninto an agreement with the Trust.\nIf an Acquired Fund invests\nsignificantly in other registered\ninvestment companies in reliance\non Rule 12d1-4, an Acquiring Fund\nwill not be permitted to rely on\nRule 12d1-4 and invest in the\nFund beyond the Section 12(d)(1)\nlimits. Any investment company\ninterested in purchasing shares\nof a Fund beyond the limits set\nforth in Section 12(d)(1) should\ncontact BFA. Foreign investment\ncompanies are permitted to invest\nin a Fund only up to the limits\nset forth in Section 12(d)(1),\nsubject to any applicable SEC no-\naction relief. Book Entry Shares\nof the Funds are held in book-\nentry form, which means that no\nstock certificates are issued.\nThe Depository Trust Company ( \u201c\nDTC \u201d ), which serves as the\nsecurities depository for shares\nof the Funds, or its nominee is\nthe record owner of, and holds\nlegal title to, all outstanding\nshares of the Funds. Investors\nowning Fund shares are beneficial\nowners as shown on the records of\nDTC or its participants. DTC\nparticipants include securities\nbrokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations\nand other institutions that\ndirectly or indirectly maintain a\ncustodial relationship with DTC.\nAs a beneficial owner of Fund\nshares, you are not entitled to\nreceive physical delivery of\nstock certificates or to have\nshares registered in your name,\nand you are not considered a\nregistered owner of shares.\nTherefore, to exercise any right\nas an owner of Fund shares, you\nmust rely upon the procedures of\nDTC and its participants. These\nprocedures are the same as those\nthat apply to any other\nsecurities held in book-entry or\n\u201c street name \u201d form. Share\nPrices The trading prices of a\nFund\u2019s shares in the secondary\nmarket generally differ from the\nFund\u2019s daily NAV and are affected\nby various factors, such as the\nsupply of and demand for ETF\nshares and the securities or\nother assets held by a Fund as\nwell as other market and economic\nconditions. Determination of Net\nAsset Value The NAV of a Fund\nnormally is determined once daily\nMonday through Friday, on each\nday that the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) is open for\ntrading. The NAV generally is\ndetermined as of the close of the\nNYSE\u2019s regular trading hours,\nnormally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,\nbased on prices at the time of\nclosing. 30 Any Fund assets or\nliabilities that are denominated\nin currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing market\nrates on the date of valuation as\nquoted by one or more data\nservice providers. The NAV of a\nFund is calculated by dividing\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s net\nassets ( i.e ., the value of its\ntotal assets, including the value\nof any underlying fund shares in\nwhich the Fund invests, less\ntotal liabilities) by the total\nnumber of outstanding shares of\nthe Fund, generally rounded to\nthe nearest cent. The value of a\nFund\u2019s assets and liabilities is\ndetermined pursuant to BFA\u2019s\nvaluation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the\nvaluation designee for each Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the\nInvestment Company Act. Equity\nsecurities and other equity\ninstruments for which market\nquotations are readily available\nare valued at market value, which\nis generally determined using the\nlast reported official closing\nprice or, if a reported closing\nprice is not available, the last\ntraded price on the exchange or\nmarket on which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at\nthe time of valuation. Shares of\nunderlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds)\nthat are not traded on an\nexchange are valued at net asset\nvalue. Shares of underlying ETFs\nand closed-end funds that trade\non exchanges are valued at their\nmost recent market closing price.\nFixed-income securities are\nvalued using last available bid\nprices or current market\nquotations provided by dealers or\nprices (including evaluated\nprices) supplied by the Funds\u2019\napproved independent third-party\npricing services, each in\naccordance with BFA\u2019s valuation\npolicies and procedures. Pricing\nservices may use matrix pricing\nor valuation models that utilize\ncertain inputs and assumptions to\nderive values. Pricing services\ngenerally value fixed-income\nsecurities assuming orderly\ntransactions of an institutional\nround lot size, but a Fund may\nhold or transact in such\nsecurities in smaller odd lot\nsizes. Odd lots often trade at\nlower prices than institutional\nround lots. An amortized cost\nmethod of valuation may be used\nwith respect to debt obligations\nwith 60 days or less remaining to\nmaturity unless BFA determines in\ngood faith that such method does\nnot represent fair value.\nGenerally, trading in certain\ninstruments ( e.g ., non-U.S.\nsecurities, money market\ninstruments, etc.) is\nsubstantially completed each day\nat various times prior to the\nclose of the NYSE\u2019s regular\ntrading hours. The values of such\ninstruments used in computing a\nFund\u2019s NAV are determined as of\nsuch times. For certain foreign\nassets, a third-party vendor\nsupplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-\nfactor model after the relevant\nforeign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to\ncorrelate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S.\nmarkets following the close of\nthe local markets to the prices\nthat might have prevailed as of a\nFund\u2019s pricing time. Customized\nexchange-traded equity options\nmay be valued using a\nmathematical model that may\nincorporate a number of market\ndata factors. When market\nquotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA\nto be unreliable, BFA will fair\nvalue a Fund\u2019s investments in\naccordance with its policies and\nprocedures. Fair value represents\na good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset 31 or\nliability. It is the amount that\nthe Fund might reasonably expect\nto receive from the current sale\nof an asset or the cost to\nextinguish a liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. BFA may\nconclude that a market quotation\nis not readily available or is\nunreliable if: \u25a0 An asset or\nliability does not have a price\nsource due to its lack of trading\nor other reasons; \u25a0 A market\nquotation differs significantly\nfrom recent price quotations or\notherwise no longer appears to\nreflect fair value; \u25a0 An asset or\nliability is thinly traded; \u25a0\nThere is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent\nmarket quotation; or \u25a0 The\ntrading market on which an\ninstrument is listed is suspended\nor closed and no appropriate\nalternative trading market is\navailable. A \u201c significant event\n\u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable\nbusiness judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing a Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, that the\nevent is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last\nexchange closing price or closing\nmarket price of one or more of\nthe Fund\u2019s assets or liabilities.\nValuing a Fund\u2019s investments\nusing fair value pricing may\nresult in prices that differ from\ncurrent market valuations and\nthat may not be the prices at\nwhich those investments could\nhave been sold during the period\nfor which the particular fair\nvalues were used. For an index\nFund, the use of both fair value\nprices and current market\nvaluations in a particular NAV\ncalculation could result in a\ndifference between the prices\nused to calculate a Fund\u2019s NAV\nand the prices used by the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying index. This could, in\nturn, result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of its\nunderlying index. Dividends and\nDistributions General Policies. A\nFund generally declares and pays\ndividends from net investment\nincome, if any, at least once a\nyear. Distributions of net\nrealized securities gains, if\nany, generally are declared and\npaid once a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more\nfrequent basis for a Fund. The\nTrust reserves the right to\ndeclare special distributions if,\nin its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or\nadvisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company\n( \u201c RIC \u201d ) or to avoid the\nimposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or\nrealized gains. Dividends and\nother distributions on Fund\nshares are distributed on a pro\nrata basis to beneficial owners\nof the shares. Dividend payments\nand other distributions are made\nthrough DTC participants and\nindirect participants to\nbeneficial owners then of record\nwith proceeds received from the\nFunds. Dividend Reinvestment\nService. No dividend reinvestment\nservice is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make the DTC\nbook-entry Dividend Reinvestment\nProgram available to beneficial\nowners of Fund shares for the\nreinvestment of distributions.\nBeneficial owners should contact\ntheir broker to determine the\navailability and costs of the\nservice and the details of\nparticipation. Brokers may\nrequire beneficial owners to\nadhere to specific procedures and\ntimetables. If the program is\nused, dividend 32 distributions\nof both income and realized gains\nwill be automatically reinvested\nin additional whole Fund shares\npurchased in the secondary\nmarket. Note on Tax Information.\nThe following sections summarize\nsome of the consequences under\ncurrent U.S. federal tax law of\nan investment in a Fund. This\ninformation is not a substitute\nfor personal tax advice. You may\nalso be subject to state and\nlocal taxation on Fund\ndistributions and sales of Fund\nshares. Distributions that are\nattributable to interest from\nU.S. federal government\nobligations may be exempt from\ncertain state and local tax.\nConsult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax\nconsequences of an investment in\nFund shares under all applicable\ntax laws. Taxes As with any\ninvestment, you should consider\nhow your investment in shares of\na Fund will be taxed, including\npossible tax consequences when a\nFund makes distributions or when\nyou sell Fund shares. The tax\ninformation in this Prospectus is\nprovided as general information,\nbased on current law. You should\nconsult your own tax professional\nabout the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of a Fund.\nThere is no guarantee that shares\nof a Fund will receive certain\nregulatory or accounting\ntreatment. Taxes on Fund\nDistributions Shareholders in a\nFund will receive information\nafter the end of each calendar\nyear setting forth the amount of\ndividends and long-term capital\ngains distributed to them by the\nFund during the prior year, if\nany. Likewise, the amount of tax-\nexempt income, if any, that a\nFund distributes will be\nreported. Such income must be\nreported on the shareholder\u2019s\nU.S. federal income tax return.\nIn general, distributions are\nsubject to U.S. federal income\ntax for the year when they are\npaid. Certain distributions paid\nin January, however, may be\ntreated as paid on December 31 of\nthe prior year. Capital Gains.\nDistributions from a Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than\nqualified dividend income or from\nnet tax-exempt income, if any),\nincluding distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and\ndistributions out of a Fund\u2019s net\nshort-term capital gains, if any,\nare taxable to you as ordinary\nincome. Distributions by a Fund\nof net long-term capital gains,\nif any, in excess of net short-\nterm capital losses (capital gain\ndividends) are taxable to you as\nlong-term capital gains,\nregardless of how long you have\nheld the Fund\u2019s shares. Long-term\ncapital gains and qualified\ndividend income are generally\neligible for taxation at\npreferential rates for non-\ncorporate shareholders. However,\ndifferent preferential rates may\napply depending on the type of\ncapital gains, such as Fund\ndistributions of certain amounts\nreceived from real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ),\nif any. Return of Capital. If a\nFund\u2019s distributions exceed\ncurrent and accumulated earnings\nand profits, all or a portion of\nthe distributions made in the\ntaxable year may be\nrecharacterized as a return of\ncapital to shareholders. A return\nof capital distribution generally\nwill not be taxable but will\nreduce the shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis and result in a higher\ncapital gain or lower capital\nloss when those shares on which\nthe distribution was received are\nsold. Once a shareholder\u2019s cost\nbasis is reduced to zero, further\n33 distributions will be treated\nas capital gains, if the\nshareholder holds shares of the\nFund as capital assets.\nDistributions in excess of a\nFund\u2019s minimum distribution\nrequirements, but not in excess\nof the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to\nshareholders and will not\nconstitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. Qualified Dividend\nIncome. Distributions by a Fund\nthat qualify as qualified\ndividend income, if any, are\ntaxable to you at long-term\ncapital gain rates. Dividends\nwill be qualified dividend income\nto you if they are attributable\nto qualified dividend income\nreceived by a Fund. Generally,\nqualified dividend income\nincludes dividend income from\nstock issued by taxable U.S.\ncorporations and qualified\nnon-U.S. corporations, provided\nthat the Fund satisfies certain\nholding period requirements and\nhas not hedged its position in\nthe stock in certain ways. For\nthis purpose, a qualified\nnon-U.S. corporation means any\nnon-U.S. corporation that is\neligible for benefits under a\ncomprehensive income tax treaty\nwith the U.S., which includes an\nexchange of information program,\nor if the stock with respect to\nwhich the dividend was paid is\nreadily tradable on an\nestablished U.S. securities\nmarket. The term excludes a\ncorporation that is a passive\nforeign investment company.\nDividends received by a Fund from\na RIC, if any, generally are\nqualified dividend income only to\nthe extent that such dividend\ndistributions are made out of\nqualified dividend income\nreceived by such RIC.\nAdditionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by a Fund from\na REIT, if any, and distributed\nto a shareholder generally will\nbe taxable to the shareholder as\nordinary income. However, for tax\nyears beginning after December\n31, 2017 and before January 1,\n2026, a Fund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified\nbusiness income \u201d deduction for\nnon-corporate U.S. shareholders\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s\nincome is derived from ordinary\nREIT dividends, reduced by\nallocable Fund expenses. For a\ndividend to be treated as\nqualified dividend income, the\ndividend must be received with\nrespect to a share of stock held\nwithout being hedged by the\nrelevant Fund, and with respect\nto a share of the Fund held\nwithout being hedged by you, for\n61 days during the 121-day period\nbeginning at the date that is 60\ndays before the date on which\nsuch share becomes ex-dividend\nwith respect to such dividend or,\nin the case of certain preferred\nstock, 91 days during the 181-day\nperiod beginning 90 days before\nsuch date. Fund distributions, to\nthe extent attributable to\ndividends from U.S. corporations,\nwill be eligible for the\ndividends received deduction for\nFund shareholders that are\ncorporations, subject to certain\nhedging and holding requirements.\nSubstitute dividends received by\na Fund with respect to dividends\npaid on securities lent out, if\nany, will not be qualified\ndividend income. Medicare Tax. A\n3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on \u201c\nnet investment income, \u201d\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net\ngain, of U.S. individuals with\nincome exceeding $200,000 (or\n$250,000 if married and filing\njointly) and of estates and\ntrusts. Alternative Minimum Tax.\nThe AMT is a separate U.S.\nfederal tax system that operates\nin parallel to the regular\nfederal income tax system but\neliminates many deductions and\nexclusions. The AMT has different\ntax rates and treats as taxable\ncertain types of 34 income that\nare nontaxable for regular income\ntax purposes, such as the\ninterest on certain \u201c private\nactivity \u201d municipal bonds. If a\ntaxpayer\u2019s overall AMT liability\nis higher than regular income tax\nliability, then the taxpayer owes\nthe regular income tax liability\nplus the difference between the\nAMT liability and the regular\nincome tax liability. Market\nDiscount Bonds Any market\ndiscount recognized on a bond,\nincluding a tax-exempt interest\nbond, is taxable as ordinary\nincome. A market discount bond is\na bond acquired in the secondary\nmarket at a price below\nredemption value or adjusted\nissue price if issued with\noriginal issue discount. To the\nextent that a Fund does not\ninclude the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gains on\nthe Fund\u2019s disposition of such an\nobligation will be treated as\nordinary income rather than\ncapital gains to the extent of\nthe accrued market discount.\nDerivatives and Other Complex\nInstruments A Fund may invest in\nderivatives and other complex\ninstruments, and such investments\nmay be subject to special and\ncomplicated rules. These rules\ncould affect whether gains and\nlosses recognized by a Fund are\ntreated as ordinary income or\ncapital gains, accelerate the\nrecognition of income to a Fund\nor defer a Fund\u2019s ability to\nrecognize losses. In addition,\nthese rules may affect the\namount, timing or character of\nincome distributed to you by a\nFund. You should consult your\npersonal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules.\nNon-U.S. Income Taxes Dividends,\ninterest and capital gains (if\nany) earned by a Fund with\nrespect to securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers may give rise to\nwithholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S.\ncountries. Tax conventions\nbetween certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If, at the close of a\nyear, more than 50% of a Fund\u2019s\ntotal assets consist of non-U.S.\nstocks or securities (generally,\nfor this purpose, depositary\nreceipts, no matter where traded,\nof non-U.S. companies are treated\nas \u201c non-U.S. \u201d ), generally the\nFund may \u201c pass through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes,\nincluding withholding taxes, paid\nby the Fund. This means that you\nwould be considered to have\nreceived as an additional\ndividend your share of such\nnon-U.S. taxes, but you may be\nentitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in\ncalculating your taxable income\nor, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in\ncalculating your U.S. federal\nincome tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to\nindividuals in computing their\nalternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not\npass through non-U.S. taxes, the\nFund will be entitled to claim a\ndeduction for certain foreign\ntaxes that it incurs. Under\ncertain circumstances, if a Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign\ntaxes paid with respect to a\nprior year, the value of Fund\nshares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions\npassed through to shareholders\nwith respect to the Fund\u2019s\nforeign taxes for the current\nyear could be reduced. If, at the\nclose of the year, more than 50%\nof a Fund\u2019s total assets consist\nof stocks or securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers, including\ndepositary receipts (no matter\nwhere traded) of non-U.S.\ncompanies, or, at the close of\neach quarter, more than 50% of a\n35 Fund\u2019s total assets consist of\nshares of an Underlying Fund, the\nFund may \u201c pass-through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes\n(including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund or, if its\nassets meet these requirements,\nthe Underlying Fund. For purposes\nof foreign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of a Fund, foreign\ncapital gains taxes may not\nproduce associated foreign source\nincome, limiting the availability\nof such credits for U.S. persons.\nNon-U.S. Shareholders If you are\nneither a resident nor a citizen\nof the U.S. or if you are a\nnon-U.S. entity (other than a\npass-through entity to the extent\nowned by U.S. persons), a Fund\u2019s\nordinary income dividends (which\ninclude distributions of net\nshort-term capital gains), if\nany, generally will be subject to\na 30% U.S. federal withholding\ntax, unless a lower treaty rate\napplies. However, withholding tax\ngenerally will not apply to any\ngain or income realized by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder with respect\nto any distribution of long-term\ncapital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of Fund shares.\nSeparately, a 30% withholding tax\nmay be imposed on Fund\ndistributions (if any) paid to\ncertain foreign entities, unless\nsuch entities comply, or are\ndeemed compliant, with extensive\nreporting and withholding\nrequirements designed to inform\nthe U.S. Department of the\nTreasury of U.S.-owned foreign\ninvestment accounts. Backup\nWithholding If you are a resident\nor a citizen of the U.S. and you\nhave not provided a taxpayer\nidentification number or social\nsecurity number and made other\nrequired certifications, by law,\nbackup withholding at a 24% rate\nwill apply to Fund distributions\nand proceeds (if any). Securities\nLending If your shares of a Fund\nare loaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending arrangement,\nyou may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends that are paid\nwhile the shares are held by the\nborrower as qualified dividend\nincome, and you may lose the\nability to use non-U.S. tax\ncredits passed through by the\nFund. Fund of Funds If a Fund\ninvests in an Underlying Fund,\nshort-term capital gains earned\nby the Underlying Fund, if any,\nwill be ordinary income when\ndistributed to the Fund and will\nnot be offset by the Fund\u2019s\ncapital losses. To the extent\nsuch Fund is expected to invest\nin an Underlying Fund, the Fund\u2019s\nrealized losses on sales of\nshares of the Underlying Fund may\nbe indefinitely or permanently\ndeferred as \u201c wash sales \u201d .\nCapital loss carryforwards of the\nUnderlying Fund, if any, will not\noffset net capital gains of the\nFund. Taxes on the Sale of\nExchange-Listed Fund Shares Any\ncapital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund shares is\ngenerally treated as a long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the\nshares have been held for more\nthan one year. Any capital gain\nor loss realized upon a sale of\nFund shares that have been held\nfor one year or less is generally\ntreated as a short-term capital\ngain or loss. However, any 36\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nshares held for six months or\nless is treated as a long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that\ncapital gain dividends were paid\nwith respect to such shares. Any\nsuch capital gains, including\nfrom sales of Fund shares or from\ncapital gain dividends, are\nincluded in \u201c net investment\nincome \u201d for purposes of the 3.8%\nU.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions Prior\nto being traded in the secondary\nmarket, Fund shares are \u201c created\n\u201d at NAV by Authorized\nParticipants ( i.e. , market\nmakers, large investors and other\nfinancial institutions) in block-\nsize Creation Units or multiples\nthereof. Fund shares are created\nor redeemed only in Creation\nUnits, and only Authorized\nParticipants may create or redeem\nCreation Units with the Funds.\nEach Authorized Participant is a\nmember or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with\nthe SEC and has entered into a\nwritten agreement with the Funds\u2019\nDistributor, an affiliate of BFA.\nThe agreement allows the\nAuthorized Participant to place\norders for the purchase and\nredemption of Creation Units.\nAuthorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units\nfor their own accounts or for\ncustomers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of the\nFunds. Creation transactions are\nsubject to acceptance by the\nDistributor and the relevant\nFund. Generally, there are three\ntransaction methods for creating\nand redeeming Fund shares: in-\nkind securities ( \u201c in-kind \u201d ),\npartial cash and all cash. In-\nKind . In a creation transaction,\nan Authorized Participant\ndeposits into a Fund a \u201c creation\nbasket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets\ndesignated by the Fund, as well\nas a cash amount. The Authorized\nParticipant receives a specified\nnumber of Creation Units in\nreturn. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation\nUnits with a Fund and receives\nfrom the Fund a \u201c redemption\nbasket, \u201d which is a portfolio of\nsecurities or other assets\ndesignated by the Fund, as well\nas a cash amount. Partial Cash .\nIn a creation transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits\ninto a Fund a creation basket and\na cash amount, including cash\nthat replaces a security or other\nasset in the creation basket, in\nexchange for Creation Units. In a\nredemption transaction, an\nAuthorized Participant deposits\nCreation Units with a Fund and\nreceives from the Fund a\nredemption basket and a cash\namount, including cash that\nreplaces a security or other\nasset in the redemption basket.\nAll Cash . In a creation\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits into a Fund\nan amount of cash specified by\nthe Fund in exchange for Creation\nUnits. In a redemption\ntransaction, an Authorized\nParticipant deposits Creation\nUnits with a Fund and receives\nfrom the Fund a specified amount\nof cash. The creation and\nredemption baskets for a Fund may\ndiffer in composition, and\ncertain iShares ETFs accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d More\ninformation about custom baskets\nis provided in the Funds\u2019 SAI. 37\n\nEach Fund generally engages in\ncreation and redemption\ntransactions according to the\nmethod indicated in the table\nbelow. In certain circumstances,\nhowever, a Fund may use another\ntransaction method ( e.g. , an\nin-kind Fund may transact\npartially or fully in cash).\n                                              \n  Fund        In-Kind  Partial      All Cash  \n                       Cash                   \n  iShares                                     \n  MSCI                                        \n  Global               \u2713                      \n  QualityFa\u2026                                  \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \nThe prices at which creations\nand redemptions occur are based\non the next calculation of a\nFund\u2019s NAV after a creation or\nredemption order is tendered in\nan acceptable form under the\nAuthorized Participant\nagreement. In the event of a\nsystem failure or other\ninterruption, including\ndisruptions at market makers or\nAuthorized Participants,\ncreation and redemption orders\nmay not be executed according\nto a Fund\u2019s instructions or may\nnot be executed at all.\nAdditional information about\nthe creation and redemption of\nCreation Units (including the\ncut-off times for the receipt\nof creation and redemption\norders) is included in the\nFunds\u2019 SAI. The Funds do not\nimpose restrictions on the\nfrequency of purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with a Fund. The Board\ndetermined not to adopt\npolicies and procedures\ndesigned to prevent or monitor\nfor frequent purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares\nbecause each Fund generally\nsells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions\nthat are in-kind and/or for\ncash, with a deadline for\nplacing cash-related\ntransactions no later than the\nclose of the primary markets\nfor the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities. However, the Funds\nhave taken certain measures (\ne.g. , imposing transaction\nfees on purchases and\nredemptions of Creation Units\nand reserving the right to\nreject purchases of Creation\nUnits under certain\ncircumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of\nfrequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased\ntracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution\nto the Funds, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the\nvast majority of trading in\nFund shares occurs on the\nsecondary market, which does\nnot involve the Funds directly,\nand such trading is unlikely to\ncause many of the harmful\neffects of frequent cash\npurchases or redemptions of\nFund shares. To the extent a\nFund engages in in-kind\ntransactions, the Fund intends\nto comply with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws in accepting\nsecurities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with\nredemption securities by, among\nother means, assuring that any\nsecurities accepted for deposit\nand any securities used to\nsatisfy redemption requests\nwill be sold in transactions\nthat would be exempt from\nregistration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as\namended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ).\nFurther, an Authorized\nParticipant that is not a \u201c\nqualified institutional buyer,\n\u201d as such term is defined in\nRule 144A under the 1933 Act,\nwill not be able to receive\nrestricted securities eligible\nfor resale under Rule 144A.\nBecause Fund shares may be\ncreated and issued on an\nongoing basis, at any point\nduring the life of a Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is\nused in the 1933 Act, may be\noccurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their\n\n38\n\npart may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their\nbeing deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that\ncould render them statutory\nunderwriters subject to the\nprospectus delivery and\nliability provisions of the\n1933 Act. Any determination of\nwhether one is an underwriter\nmust take into account all the\nrelevant facts and\ncircumstances of each\nparticular case. Broker-dealers\nshould also note that dealers\nwho are not \u201c underwriters \u201d\nbut are participating in a\ndistribution (as contrasted to\nordinary secondary\ntransactions), and thus dealing\nwith shares that are part of an\n\u201c unsold allotment \u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C)\nof the 1933 Act, would be\nunable to take advantage of the\nprospectus delivery exemption\nprovided by Section 4(a)(3) of\nthe 1933 Act. For delivery of\nprospectuses to exchange\nmembers, the prospectus\ndelivery mechanism of Rule 153\nunder the 1933 Act is available\nonly with respect to\ntransactions on a national\nsecurities exchange.\nHouseholding Householding is an\noption available to certain\nFund investors. Householding is\na method of delivery, based on\nthe preference of the\nindividual investor, in which a\nsingle copy of certain\nshareholder documents can be\ndelivered to investors who\nshare the same address, even if\ntheir accounts are registered\nunder different names.

The Trust was\norganized as a Delaware statutory trust on\nDecember 16, 1999 and is authorized to have\nmultiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an\nopen-end management investment company\nregistered with the SEC under the 1940 Act.\nThe offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ). This SAI\nrelates solely to the Fund. The Fund is\nmanaged by BlackRock Fund Advisors ( \u201c BFA \u201d\n), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of\nBlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track\nthe investment results of the specific\nbenchmark index identified in the Fund's\nProspectus (the \u201c Underlying Index \u201d ). The\nFund offers and issues shares at their net\nasset value per share ( \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in\naggregations of a specified number of shares\n(each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ), generally in\nexchange for a designated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other positions\n(including any portion of such securities for\nwhich cash may be substituted) included in its\nUnderlying Index (the \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d\nor \u201c Creation Basket \u201d ), together with the\ndeposit of a specified cash payment (the \u201c\nCash Component \u201d ). Shares of the Fund are\nlisted for trading on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc.\n(the \u201c Listing Exchange \u201d or \u201c Cboe BZX \u201d ), a\nnational securities exchange. Shares of the\nFund are traded in the secondary market and\nelsewhere at market prices that may be at,\nabove or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are\nredeemable only in Creation Units by\nAuthorized Participants (as defined in the\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role\nof the Authorized Participant section of this\nSAI), and, generally, in exchange for\nportfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as\ndefined in the Redemption of Creation Units\nsection of this SAI). Creation Units typically\nare a specified number of shares, generally\n100,000 or multiples thereof. The Trust\nreserves the right to permit or require that\ncreations and redemptions of shares are\neffected fully or partially in cash and\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of\ncash. Shares may be issued in advance of\nreceipt of Deposit Securities, subject to\nvarious conditions, including a requirement\nthat the Authorized Participant maintain with\nthe Trust collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\npurchase Deposit Securities. See the Creation\nand Redemption of Creation Units section of\nthis SAI. Transaction fees and other costs\nassociated with creations or redemptions that\ninclude a cash portion may be higher than the\ntransaction fees and other costs associated\nwith in-kind creations or redemptions. In all\ncases, conditions with respect to creations\nand redemptions of shares and fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nSEC rules and regulations applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering\nredeemable securities. Exchange Listing and\nTrading A discussion of exchange listing and\ntrading matters associated with an investment\nin the Fund is contained in the Shareholder\nInformation section of the Fund's Prospectus.\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, that section of\nthe Prospectus. Shares of the Fund are listed\nfor trading, and trade throughout the day, on\nthe Listing Exchange and in other secondary\nmarkets. Shares of the Fund may also be listed\non certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no\nassurance that the requirements of the Listing\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nshares of the Fund will continue to be met.\nThe Listing Exchange may, but is not required\nto, remove the shares of the Fund from listing\nif, among other things: (i) following the\ninitial 12-month period beginning upon the\ncommencement of trading of Fund shares, there\nare fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial\nowners of shares of the Fund; (ii) the Fund is\nno longer eligible to operate in reliance on\nRule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act;\n(iii) any of the other listing requirements\nare not continuously maintained; or (iv) any\nevent shall occur or condition shall exist\nthat, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Listing Exchange\ninadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also\nremove shares of the Fund from listing and\ntrading upon termination of the Fund. As in\nthe case of other publicly-traded securities,\nwhen you buy or sell shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker, you may incur a brokerage\ncommission determined by that broker, as well\nas other charges.\n\n1\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nshare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor's\nequity interest in the Fund. Investment\nStrategies and Risks The Fund seeks to achieve\nits objective by investing primarily in\nsecurities issued by issuers that compose the\nUnderlying Index and in investments that\nprovide substantially similar exposure to\nsecurities in the Underlying Index. The Fund\noperates as an index fund and is not actively\nmanaged. Adverse performance of a security in\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio will ordinarily not\nresult in the elimination of the security from\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio. The Fund engages in\nrepresentative sampling, which is investing in\na sample of securities selected by BFA to have\na collective investment profile similar to\nthat of the Fund's Underlying Index.\nSecurities selected have aggregate investment\ncharacteristics (based on market\ncapitalization and industry weightings),\nfundamental characteristics (such as return\nvariability, earnings valuation and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to those of the\nFund\u2019s Underlying Index. A fund that uses\nrepresentative sampling generally does not\nhold all of the securities that are in its\nunderlying index. Although the Fund does not\nseek leveraged returns, certain instruments\nused by the Fund may have a leveraging effect\nas described below. Borrowing. The Fund may\nborrow for temporary or emergency purposes,\nincluding to meet payments due from\nredemptions or to facilitate the settlement of\nsecurities or other transactions. The purchase\nof securities while borrowings are outstanding\nmay have the effect of leveraging the Fund.\nThe incurrence of leverage increases the\nFund\u2019s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds\nare subject to interest costs that will reduce\nnet income. Purchasing securities while\nborrowings are outstanding creates special\nrisks, such as the potential for greater\nvolatility in the NAV of Fund shares and in\nthe yield on the Fund\u2019s portfolio. In\naddition, the interest expenses from\nborrowings may exceed the income generated by\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio and, therefore, the\namount available (if any) for distribution to\nshareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA\nmay determine to maintain outstanding\nborrowings if it expects that the benefits to\nthe Fund\u2019s shareholders will outweigh the\ncurrent reduced return. Certain types of\nborrowings by the Fund must be made from a\nbank or may result in the Fund being subject\nto covenants in credit agreements relating to\nasset coverage, portfolio composition\nrequirements and other matters. It is not\nanticipated that observance of such covenants\nwould impede BFA\u2019s management of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment objectives and policies. However, a\nbreach of any such covenants not cured within\nthe specified cure period may result in\nacceleration of outstanding indebtedness and\nrequire the Fund to dispose of portfolio\ninvestments at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. Currency\nTransactions. A currency forward contract is\nan over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) obligation to\npurchase or sell a specific currency at a\nfuture date, which may be any fixed number of\ndays greater than two days from the date on\nwhich the contract is agreed upon by the\nparties, at a price set at the time of the\ncontract. A non-deliverable currency forward\nis an OTC currency forward settled in a\nspecified currency, on a specified date, based\non the difference between the agreed-upon\nexchange rate and the market exchange rate. A\ncurrency futures contract is a contract that\ntrades on an organized futures exchange\ninvolving an obligation to deliver or acquire\na specified amount of a specific currency, at\na specified price and at a specified future\ntime. Currency futures contracts may be\nsettled on a net cash payment basis rather\nthan by the sale and delivery of the\nunderlying currency. The Fund does not expect\nto engage in currency transactions for the\npurpose of hedging against declines in the\nvalue of the Fund's assets that are\ndenominated in a non-U.S. currency. The Fund\nmay enter into non-U.S. currency forward and\nnon-U.S. currency futures transactions to\nfacilitate local securities settlements or to\nprotect against currency exposure in\nconnection with its distributions to\nshareholders, but may not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes. Foreign\nexchange transactions involve a significant\ndegree of risk and the markets in which\nforeign exchange transactions are effected may\nbe highly volatile, highly specialized and\nhighly technical. Significant changes,\nincluding changes in liquidity and prices, can\noccur in such markets within very short\nperiods of time, often within minutes. Foreign\nexchange trading risks include, but are not\nlimited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty\nrisk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and\npotential interference\n\n2\n\nby foreign governments through regulation of\nlocal exchange markets, foreign investment or\nparticular transactions in non-U.S. currency.\nIf BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions\nat an inappropriate time or judges market\nconditions, trends or correlations\nincorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may\nnot serve their intended purpose of improving\nthe correlation of the Fund's return with the\nperformance of the Underlying Index and may\nlower the Fund\u2019s return. The Fund could\nexperience losses if the value of its currency\nforwards, options or futures positions were\npoorly correlated with its other investments\nor if it could not close out its positions\nbecause of an illiquid market or otherwise. In\naddition, the Fund could incur transaction\ncosts, including trading commissions, in\nconnection with certain non-U.S. currency\ntransactions. Diversification Status. The Fund\nis classified as \u201c non-diversified. \u201d A \u201c non-\ndiversified \u201d fund is a fund that is not\nlimited by the 1940 Act with regard to the\npercentage of its assets that may be invested\nin the securities of a single issuer. The\nsecurities of a particular issuer (or\nsecurities of issuers in particular\nindustries) may constitute a significant\npercentage of the underlying index of such a\nfund and, consequently, the fund\u2019s investment\nportfolio. This may adversely affect the\nfund\u2019s performance or subject the fund\u2019s\nshares to greater price volatility than that\nexperienced by more diversified investment\ncompanies. The Fund intends to maintain the\nrequired level of diversification and\notherwise conduct its operations so as to\nqualify as a regulated investment company ( \u201c\nRIC \u201d ) for purposes of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c\nInternal Revenue Code \u201d ), and to relieve the\nFund of any liability for U.S. federal income\ntax to the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to shareholders, provided that the\nFund satisfies a minimum distribution\nrequirement. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective. Futures, Options on Futures and\nSecurities Options. Futures contracts, options\non futures and securities options may be used\nby the Fund to simulate investment in its\nUnderlying Index, to facilitate trading or to\nreduce transaction costs. The Fund may enter\ninto futures contracts and options on futures\nthat are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures\nexchange. The Fund will not use futures,\noptions on futures or securities options for\nspeculative purposes. The Fund intends to use\nfutures and options on futures in accordance\nwith Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201c CFTC \u201d ) promulgated under\nthe Commodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ). BFA,\nwith respect to the Fund, has claimed an\nexclusion from the definition of the term \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d in accordance with\nRule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to the\nFund, is not subject to registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under\nthe CEA. See the Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives section of this SAI for more\ninformation. Futures contracts provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified amount of a\nspecific instrument or index at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Stock\nindex contracts are based on investments that\nreflect the market value of common stock of\nthe firms included in the investments. The\nFund may enter into futures contracts to\npurchase securities indexes when BFA\nanticipates purchasing the underlying\nsecurities and believes prices will rise\nbefore the purchase will be made. Upon\nentering into a futures contract, the Fund\nwill be required to deposit with the broker an\namount of cash or cash equivalents known as \u201c\ninitial margin, \u201d which is similar to a\nperformance bond or good faith deposit on the\ncontract and is returned to the Fund upon\ntermination of the futures contract if all\ncontractual obligations have been satisfied.\nSubsequent payments, known as \u201c variation\nmargin, \u201d will be made to and from the broker\ndaily as the price of the instrument or index\nunderlying the futures contract fluctuates,\nmaking the long and short positions in the\nfutures contract more or less valuable, a\nprocess known as \u201c marking-to-market. \u201d At any\ntime prior to the expiration of a futures\ncontract, the Fund may elect to close the\nposition by taking an opposite position, which\nwill operate to terminate the Fund\u2019s existing\nposition in the contract. An option on a\nfutures contract, as contrasted with a direct\ninvestment in such a contract, gives the\npurchaser the right, but no obligation, in\nreturn for the premium paid, to assume a\nposition in the underlying futures contract at\na specified exercise price at any time prior\nto the expiration date of the option. Upon\nexercise of an option, the delivery of the\nfutures position by the writer of the option\nto the holder of the option will be\naccompanied by delivery of the accumulated\nbalance in the writer\u2019s futures margin account\nthat represents the amount by which the market\nprice of the futures contract exceeds (in the\ncase of a call) or is less than (in the case\nof a put) the exercise price of the option on\nthe futures contract. The potential for loss\nrelated to the purchase of an option on a\nfutures contract is limited to the premium\npaid for the option plus transaction costs.\nBecause the value of the option is fixed at\nthe point of sale, there are no daily cash\npayments by the purchaser to reflect changes\nin the value of the underlying contract;\nhowever, the value of the option changes daily\nand that change would be reflected in the NAV\nof the Fund. The potential for loss related to\nwriting call options is unlimited. The\npotential for loss related to writing put\noptions is limited to the agreed-upon price\nper share, also known as the \u201c strike price, \u201d\nless the premium received from writing the\nput. The Fund may purchase and write put and\ncall options on futures contracts\n\n3\n\nthat are traded on an exchange as a hedge\nagainst changes in value of its portfolio\nsecurities or in anticipation of the purchase\nof securities, and may enter into closing\ntransactions with respect to such options to\nterminate existing positions. There is no\nguarantee that such closing transactions can\nbe effected. Securities options may be used by\nthe Fund to obtain access to securities in the\nUnderlying Index or to dispose of securities\nin the Underlying Index at favorable prices,\nto invest cash in a securities index that\noffers similar exposure to that provided by\nthe Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve\nthe Fund\u2019s objective of tracking the\nUnderlying Index. A call option gives a holder\nthe right to purchase a specific security at a\nspecified price ( \u201c exercise price \u201d ) within\na specified period of time. A put option gives\na holder the right to sell a specific security\nat an exercise price within a specified period\nof time. The initial purchaser of a call\noption pays the \u201c writer \u201d a premium, which is\npaid at the time of purchase and is retained\nby the writer whether or not such option is\nexercised. The Fund may purchase put options\nto hedge its portfolio against the risk of a\ndecline in the market value of securities held\nand may purchase call options to hedge against\nan increase in the price of securities it is\ncommitted to purchase. The Fund may write put\nand call options along with a long position in\noptions to increase its ability to hedge\nagainst a change in the market value of the\nsecurities it holds or is committed to\npurchase. The Fund may purchase or sell\nsecurities options on a U.S. or non-U.S.\nsecurities exchange or in the OTC market\nthrough a transaction with a dealer. Options\non a securities index are typically settled on\na net basis based on the appreciation or\ndepreciation of the index level over the\nstrike price. Options on single name\nsecurities may be cash- or physically-settled,\ndepending upon the market in which they are\ntraded. Options may be structured so as to be\nexercisable only on certain dates or on a\ndaily basis. Options may also be structured to\nhave conditions to exercise ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-\nin Events \u201d ) or conditions that trigger\ntermination ( i.e. , \u201c Knock-out Events \u201d ).\nLending Portfolio Securities. The Fund may\nlend portfolio securities to certain borrowers\nthat BFA determines to be creditworthy,\nincluding borrowers affiliated with BFA. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is\nmaintained in an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent market value of the securities loaned.\nNo securities loan shall be made on behalf of\nthe Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value\nof all securities loans of the Fund exceeds\none-third of the value of the Fund's total\nassets (including the value of the collateral\nreceived). The Fund may terminate a loan at\nany time and obtain the return of the\nsecurities loaned. The Fund receives, by way\nof substitute payment, the value of any\ninterest or cash or non-cash distributions\npaid on the loaned securities that it would\nhave otherwise received if the securities were\nnot on loan. With respect to loans that are\ncollateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount\nof cash collateral. The Fund is compensated by\nany positive difference between the amount\nearned on the reinvestment of cash collateral\nand the fee paid to the borrower. In the case\nof collateral other than cash, the Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral\nreceived by the Fund for such loans, and\nuninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain\nshort-term instruments either directly on\nbehalf of the Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or money market funds,\nincluding those affiliated with BFA; such\ninvestments are subject to investment risk.\nThe Fund conducts its securities lending\npursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC\npermitting it to lend portfolio securities to\nborrowers affiliated with the Fund and to\nretain an affiliate of the Fund to act as\nsecurities lending agent. To the extent that\nthe Fund engages in securities lending,\nBlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (\n\u201c BTC \u201d ) acts as securities lending agent for\nthe Fund, subject to the overall supervision\nof BFA. BTC administers the lending program in\naccordance with guidelines approved by the\nTrust's Board of Trustees (the \u201c Board, \u201d the\ntrustees of which are the \u201c Trustees \u201d ).\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( \u201c JPMorgan \u201d )\nserves as custodian for the Fund in connection\nwith certain securities lending activities.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a\nmismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees the Fund has agreed\nto pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk\n(i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default when\na cash collateral investment is denominated in\na currency other than the currency of the\nassets being loaned due to movements in\nforeign exchange rates), and credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risks (including the\nrisk that market events, including but not\nlimited to corporate actions, could lead the\nFund to lend securities that are trading at a\npremium due to increased demand, or to recall\nloaned securities or to lend less or not at\nall, which could lead to reduced securities\nlending revenue). If the Fund were to lend out\nsecurities that are subject to a corporate\naction and commit to the borrower a particular\nelection as determined by the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, the benefit the Fund would\nreceive in respect of committing to such\nelection may or may not be less than the\nbenefit the Fund would have received from\nmaking a different election in such corporate\naction. If a securities lending counterparty\nwere to default, the Fund would be subject to\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In\n\n4\n\nthe event a borrower does not return the\nFund\u2019s securities as agreed, the Fund\u2019s\nability to participate in a corporate action\nevent may be impacted, or the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs incurred in purchasing\nreplacement securities. This latter event\ncould trigger adverse tax consequences for the\nFund. The Fund could lose money if its short-\nterm investment of the collateral declines in\nvalue over the period of the loan. Substitute\npayments received by the Fund representing\ndividends paid on securities loaned out by the\nFund will not be considered qualified dividend\nincome. BTC will take into account the tax\neffects on shareholders caused by this\ndifference in connection with the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities lending program. Substitute\npayments received on tax-exempt securities\nloaned out will not be tax-exempt income.\nThere could also be changes in the status of\nissuers under applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding tax regulations, that may impact the\nregulatory or tax treatment of loaned\nsecurities and could, for example, result in a\ndelay in the payment of dividend equivalent\npayments owed to the Fund (as permitted by\napplicable law). Regulations adopted by global\nprudential regulators require certain bank-\nregulated counterparties and certain of their\naffiliates to include in certain financial\ncontracts, including many securities lending\nagreements, terms that delay or restrict the\nrights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to\nterminate such agreements, foreclose upon\ncollateral, exercise other default rights or\nrestrict transfers of credit support in the\nevent that the counterparty and/or its\naffiliates are subject to certain types of\nresolution or insolvency proceedings. It is\npossible that these requirements, as well as\npotential additional government regulation and\nother developments in the market, could\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to\nterminate existing securities lending\nagreements or to realize amounts to be\nreceived under such agreements. Prudential\nregulation may also favor lenders that can\nprovide additional protections, such as liens\nthat are exercisable upon lender default, to\nbank borrowers. The Fund may provide\nadditional protections to bank borrowers,\nwhere permitted pursuant to the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment policies and if BFA believes doing\nso is in the best interest of the Fund.\nLiquidity Risk Management. Rule 22e-4 under\nthe Investment Company Act (the \u201c Liquidity\nRule \u201d ) requires open-end funds, including\nexchange-traded funds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) such as the\nFund, to establish a liquidity risk management\nprogram (the \u201c Liquidity Program \u201d ) and\nenhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity.\nAs required by the Liquidity Rule, the Fund\nhas implemented a Liquidity Program, and the\nBoard, including a majority of the Independent\nTrustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as\nthe administrator of the Liquidity Program.\nUnder the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses,\nmanages, and periodically reviews the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity risk and classifies each investment\nheld by the Fund as a \u201c highly liquid\ninvestment, \u201d \u201c moderately liquid investment,\n\u201d \u201c less liquid investment \u201d or \u201c illiquid\ninvestment. \u201d The Liquidity Rule defines \u201c\nliquidity risk \u201d as the risk that the Fund\ncould not meet requests to redeem shares\nissued by the Fund without significant\ndilution of the remaining investors\u2019 interest\nin the Fund. The liquidity of the Fund's\nportfolio investments is determined based on\nrelevant market, trading and investment-\nspecific considerations under the Liquidity\nProgram. There are exclusions from certain\nportions of the liquidity risk management\nprogram requirements for \u201c in-kind \u201d ETFs, as\ndefined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent\nthat an investment is deemed to be an illiquid\ninvestment or a less liquid investment, the\nFund can expect to be exposed to greater\nliquidity risk. Non-U.S. Securities. The Fund\nmay purchase publicly traded common stocks of\nnon-U.S. issuers. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, the\nFund's investment in such stocks may be in the\nform of American Depositary Receipts ( \u201c ADRs\n\u201d ), Global Depositary Receipts ( \u201c GDRs \u201d )\nand European Depositary Receipts ( \u201c EDRs \u201d )\n(collectively, \u201c depositary receipts \u201d ).\nDepositary receipts are receipts, typically\nissued by a bank or trust issuer, which\nevidence ownership of underlying securities\nissued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary\nreceipts may not necessarily be denominated in\nthe same currency as their underlying\nsecurities. ADRs typically are issued by a\nU.S. bank or trust company and evidence\nownership of underlying securities issued by a\nnon-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes\nreferred to as continental depositary\nreceipts, are receipts issued in Europe,\ntypically by foreign banks and trust\ncompanies, that evidence ownership of either\nforeign or domestic underlying securities.\nGDRs are depositary receipts structured like\nglobal debt issues to facilitate trading on an\ninternational basis. Generally, ADRs, issued\nin registered form, are designed for use in\nthe U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, issued\nin bearer form, are designed for use in\nEuropean securities markets. GDRs are tradable\nboth in the U.S. and in Europe and are\ndesigned for use throughout the world.\nDepositary receipts are generally subject to\nthe same risks as the foreign securities that\nthey evidence or into which they may be\nconverted. In addition to investment risks\nassociated with the underlying issuer,\ndepositary receipts expose the Fund to\nadditional risks associated with the non-\nuniform terms that apply to depositary receipt\nprograms, credit exposure to the depository\nbank and to the sponsors and other parties\nwith whom the depository bank establishes the\nprograms, currency risk and liquidity risk.\nUnsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned\nby the issuer of the underlying common stock,\ngenerally expose investors to greater risks\nthan sponsored programs and do not provide\nholders with many of the shareholder benefits\nthat come from investing in a sponsored\ndepositary receipts.\n\n5\n\nInvesting in the securities of non-U.S.\nissuers involves special risks and\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in U.S. issuers. These include\ndifferences in accounting, auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards; the possibility\nof expropriation or confiscatory taxation;\nadverse changes in investment or exchange\ncontrol regulations; political instability,\nwhich could affect U.S. investments in\nnon-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions\non the flow of international capital. Non-U.S.\nissuers may be subject to less governmental\nregulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover,\nindividual non-U.S. economies may differ\nfavorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy\nin such respects as growth of gross domestic\nproduct ( \u201c GDP \u201d ), rate of inflation,\ncapital reinvestment, resource self-\nsufficiency and balance of payment positions.\nRegulation Regarding Derivatives. The CFTC\nsubjects advisers to registered investment\ncompanies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund\nthat is advised by the adviser either (i)\ninvests, directly or indirectly, more than a\nprescribed level of its liquidation value in\nCFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps ( \u201c\nCFTC Derivatives \u201d ) or (ii) markets itself as\nproviding investment exposure to such\ninstruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers\nto registered investment companies to\nregulation by the CFTC if the registered\ninvestment company invests in one or more\ncommodity pools. To the extent the Fund uses\nCFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below\nsuch prescribed levels and intends not to\nmarket itself as a \u201c commodity pool \u201d or a\nvehicle for trading such instruments. BFA has\nclaimed an exclusion from the definition of\nthe term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the\nCEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. BFA is not, therefore,\nsubject to registration or regulation as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA with\nrespect to the Fund. The Fund (the \u201c No-Action\nLetter Fund \u201d ) may also have investments in \u201c\nunderlying funds \u201d (and such underlying funds\nthemselves may invest in underlying funds) not\nadvised by BFA (the term \u201c underlying fund \u201d\nfor purposes of the no-action letter\nreferenced below may include, but is not\nlimited to, certain securitized vehicles,\nmortgage or international real estate\ninvestment trusts ( \u201c REITs \u201d ), business\ndevelopment companies and, investment\ncompanies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives\nor in any of the foregoing), and therefore may\nbe viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA\nmay not have transparency into the holdings of\nthese underlying funds because they are not\nadvised by BFA. To address this issue of lack\nof transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-\naction letter on November 29, 2012 permitting\nthe adviser of a fund that invests in such\nunderlying funds and that would otherwise have\nfiled a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC\nRule 4.5 to delay registration as a \u201c\ncommodity pool operator \u201d until six months\nfrom the date on which the CFTC issues\nadditional guidance on the treatment of CFTC\nDerivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the\nadviser of the No-Action Letter Fund, expects\nto file a claim with the CFTC for the Fund to\nrely on this no-action relief. Assuming the\nCFTC does not reject such claim, BFA should\nnot be subject to registration or regulation\nas a \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d under the CEA\nin respect of the Fund. Derivative contracts,\nincluding, without limitation, swaps, currency\nforwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are\nsubject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n( \u201c Dodd-Frank Act \u201d ) in the U.S. and under\ncomparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable\nforwards and certain other derivatives traded\nin the OTC market are subject to variation\nmargin and initial margin requirements.\nImplementation of the margining and other\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding\nclearing, mandatory trading, reporting and\ndocumentation of swaps and other derivatives\nhave impacted and may continue to impact the\ncosts to the Fund of trading these instruments\nand, as a result, may affect returns to\ninvestors in the Fund. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits the Fund to\nenter into Derivatives Transactions (as\ndefined below) and certain other transactions\nnotwithstanding the restrictions on the\nissuance of \u201c senior securities \u201d under\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act.\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act,\namong other things, prohibits open-end funds,\nincluding the Fund, from issuing or selling\nany \u201c senior security, \u201d other than borrowing\nfrom a bank (subject to a requirement to\nmaintain 300% \u201c asset coverage \u201d ). Under Rule\n18f-4, \u201c Derivatives Transactions \u201d include\nthe following: (1) any swap, security-based\nswap (including a contract for differences),\nfutures contract, forward contract, option\n(excluding purchased options), any combination\nof the foregoing, or any similar instrument,\nunder which the Fund is or may be required to\nmake any payment or delivery of cash or other\nassets during the life of the instrument or at\nmaturity or early termination, whether as\nmargin or settlement payment or otherwise; (2)\nany short sale borrowing; (3) reverse\nrepurchase agreements and similar financing\ntransactions ( e.g ., recourse and non-\nrecourse tender option bonds, and borrowed\nbonds), if the Fund elects to treat these\ntransactions as Derivatives Transactions under\nRule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-\nsettling securities ( e.g. , firm and standby\ncommitments, including to-be-announced ( \u201c TBA\n\u201d ) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-\nstandard settlement cycle securities, unless\nthe\n\n6\n\nFund intends to physically settle the\ntransaction and the transaction will settle\nwithin 35 days of its trade date (the \u201c\nDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision \u201d ).\nUnless the Fund is relying on the Limited\nDerivatives User Exception (as defined below),\nthe Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule\n18f-4, among other things, requires the Fund\nto adopt and implement a comprehensive written\nderivatives risk management program ( \u201c DRMP \u201d\n) and comply with a relative or absolute limit\non Fund leverage risk calculated based on\nvalue-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ). The DRMP is\nadministered by a \u201c derivatives risk manager,\n\u201d who is appointed by the Board, including a\nmajority of Independent Directors/Trustees,\nand periodically reviews the DRMP and reports\nto the Board. Rule 18f-4 provides an exception\nfrom the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other\nrequirements if the Fund's \u201c derivatives\nexposure \u201d (as defined in Rule 18f-4) is\nlimited to 10% of its net assets (as\ncalculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and\nthe Fund adopts and implements written\npolicies and procedures reasonably designed to\nmanage its derivatives risks (the \u201c Limited\nDerivatives User Exception \u201d ). Repurchase\nAgreements. A repurchase agreement is an\ninstrument under which the purchaser ( i.e. ,\nthe Fund) acquires a security and the seller\nagrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase\nthe security at a mutually agreed-upon time\nand price, thereby determining the yield\nduring the purchaser\u2019s holding period.\nRepurchase agreements may be construed to be\ncollateralized loans by the purchaser to the\nseller secured by the securities transferred\nto the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is\nconstrued to be a collateralized loan, the\nunderlying securities will not be considered\nto be owned by the Fund but only to constitute\ncollateral for the seller\u2019s obligation to pay\nthe repurchase price, and, in the event of a\ndefault by the seller, the Fund may suffer\ntime delays and incur costs or losses in\nconnection with the disposition of the\ncollateral. In any repurchase transaction, the\ncollateral for a repurchase agreement may\ninclude: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations\nissued by the U.S. government or its agencies\nor instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations\nthat, at the time the repurchase agreement is\nentered into, are determined to (A) have\nexceptionally strong capacity to meet their\nfinancial obligations and (B) are sufficiently\nliquid such that they can be sold at\napproximately their carrying value in the\nordinary course of business within seven days.\nRepurchase agreements pose certain risks for\nthe Fund, should it decide to utilize them.\nSuch risks are not unique to the Fund, but are\ninherent in repurchase agreements. The Fund\nseeks to minimize such risks, but because of\nthe inherent legal uncertainties involved in\nrepurchase agreements, such risks cannot be\neliminated. Lower quality collateral and\ncollateral with a longer maturity may be\nsubject to greater price fluctuations than\nhigher quality collateral and collateral with\na shorter maturity. If the repurchase\nagreement counterparty were to default, lower\nquality collateral may be more difficult to\nliquidate than higher quality collateral.\nShould the counterparty default and the amount\nof collateral not be sufficient to cover the\ncounterparty\u2019s repurchase obligation, the Fund\nwould likely retain the status of an unsecured\ncreditor of the counterparty ( i.e. , the\nposition the Fund would normally be in if it\nwere to hold, pursuant to its investment\npolicies, other unsecured debt securities of\nthe defaulting counterparty) with respect to\nthe amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured\ncreditor, the Fund would be at risk of losing\nsome or all of the principal and income\ninvolved in the transaction. Reverse\nRepurchase Agreements. Reverse repurchase\nagreements involve the sale of securities with\nan agreement to repurchase the securities at\nan agreed-upon price, date and interest\npayment and have the characteristics of\nborrowing. Generally, the effect of such\ntransactions is that the Fund can recover all\nor most of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are advantageous\nonly if the Fund has an opportunity to earn a\nrate of interest on the cash derived from\nthese transactions that is greater than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available, and the Fund intends to\nuse the reverse repurchase technique only when\nBFA believes it will be advantageous to the\nFund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements\nmay exaggerate any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s assets. The use of reverse\nrepurchase agreements is a form of leverage,\nand the proceeds obtained by the Fund through\nreverse repurchase agreements may be invested\nin additional securities. Rule 18f-4 under the\nInvestment Company Act permits the Fund to\nenter into reverse repurchase agreements and\nsimilar financing transactions ( e.g.,\nrecourse and non-recourse tender option bonds,\nborrowed bonds) notwithstanding the limitation\non the issuance of senior securities in\nSection 18 of the Investment Company Act,\nprovided that the Fund either (i) complies\nwith the 300% asset coverage ratio with\nrespect to such transactions and any other\nborrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treats\nsuch transactions as Derivatives Transactions\nunder Rule 18f-4. (See \u201c Regulation Regarding\nDerivatives \u201d above.)\n\n7\n\nSecurities of Investment Companies. The Fund\nmay invest in the securities of other\ninvestment companies (including money market\nfunds) to the extent permitted by law.\nPursuant to the 1940 Act, the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment in registered investment companies\nis generally limited to, subject to certain\nexceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of any one investment company;\n(ii) 5% of the Fund\u2019s total assets with\nrespect to any one investment company; and\n(iii) 10% of the Fund\u2019s total assets with\nrespect to investment companies in the\naggregate. Other investment companies in which\nthe Fund may invest can be expected to incur\nfees and expenses for operations, such as\ninvestment advisory and administration fees,\nwhich would be in addition to those incurred\nby the Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by\nthe SEC staff, fees and expenses of money\nmarket funds used for cash collateral received\nin connection with loans of securities are not\ntreated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses,\nwhich reflect the Fund\u2019s pro rata share of the\nfees and expenses incurred by investing in\nother investment companies (as disclosed in\nthe Prospectus, as applicable). Short-Term\nInstruments and Temporary Investments. The\nFund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, on an\nongoing basis to provide liquidity or for\nother reasons. Money market instruments are\ngenerally short-term investments that may\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) shares of\nmoney market funds (including those advised by\nBFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c\nCDs \u201d ), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed-time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nnon-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches)\nand similar institutions; (iv) commercial\npaper rated, at the date of purchase, \u201c\nPrime-1 \u201d by Moody's \u00ae Investors Service,\nInc., \u201c F-1 \u201d by Fitch Ratings, Inc., or \u201c A-1\n\u201d by Standard & Poor's \u00ae Global Ratings, a\nsubsidiary of S&P Global, Inc., or if unrated,\nof comparable quality as determined by BFA;\n(v) non-convertible corporate debt securities\n( e.g. , bonds and debentures) with remaining\nmaturities at the date of purchase of not more\nthan 397 days and that have been determined to\npresent minimal credit risks, in accordance\nwith the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7\nunder the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase\nagreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-\ndenominated obligations of non-U.S. banks\n(including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion\nof BFA, are of comparable quality to\nobligations of U.S. banks that may be\npurchased by the Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions. Swap Agreements.\nSwap agreements are contracts between parties\nin which one party agrees to make periodic\npayments to the other party based on a pre-\ndetermined underlying investment or notional\namount. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the first party\nbased on the return (or a differential in rate\nof return) earned or realized on the\nunderlying investment or notional amount. Swap\nagreements will usually be performed on a net\nbasis, with the Fund receiving or paying only\nthe net amount of the two payments. The net\namount of the excess, if any, of the Fund\u2019s\nobligations over its entitlements with respect\nto each swap is accrued on a daily basis. The\nuse of swaps is a highly specialized activity\nthat involves investment techniques and risks\ndifferent from those associated with ordinary\nportfolio security transactions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets. Tracking Stocks. A tracking stock is a\nseparate class of common stock whose value is\nlinked to a specific business unit or\noperating division within a larger company and\nis designed to \u201c track \u201d the performance of\nsuch business unit or division. The tracking\nstock may pay dividends to shareholders\nindependent of the parent company. The parent\ncompany, rather than the business unit or\ndivision, generally is the issuer of tracking\nstock. However, holders of the tracking stock\nmay not have the same rights as holders of the\ncompany\u2019s common stock. Future Developments.\nThe Board may, in the future, authorize the\nFund to invest in securities contracts and\ninvestments, other than those listed in this\nSAI and in the Prospectus, provided they are\nconsistent with the Fund's investment\nobjective and do not violate any of its\ninvestment restrictions or policies. General\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of some\nof the principal risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. An investment in the Fund should\nbe made with an understanding that the value\nof the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of stocks in\n\n8\n\ngeneral, and other factors that affect the\nmarket. The order of the below risk factors\ndoes not indicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. Borrowing Risk.\nBorrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of\nFund shares and in the return on the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio. Borrowing will cause the Fund to\nincur interest expense and other fees. The\ncosts of borrowing may reduce the Fund\u2019s\nreturn. Borrowing may cause the Fund to\nliquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy its\nobligations. Commodities Investment Risk.\nExposure to commodities markets may subject\nthe Fund to greater volatility than\ninvestments in traditional securities. The\ncommodities markets have experienced periods\nof extreme volatility. Similar future market\nconditions may result in rapid and substantial\nvaluation increases or decreases in the Fund\u2019s\nholdings. The commodities markets may\nfluctuate widely based on a variety of\nfactors. Movements in commodity investment\nprices are outside of the Fund's control and\nmay not be anticipated by BFA. Price movements\nmay be influenced by, among other things:\ngovernmental, agricultural, trade, fiscal,\nmonetary and exchange control programs and\npolicies; changing market and economic\nconditions; market liquidity; weather and\nclimate conditions, including droughts and\nfloods; livestock disease; changing supply and\ndemand relationships and levels of domestic\nproduction and imported commodities; changes\nin storage costs; the availability of local,\nintrastate and interstate transportation\nsystems; energy conservation; the success of\nexploration projects; changes in international\nbalances of payments and trade; domestic and\nforeign rates of inflation; currency\ndevaluations and revaluations; domestic and\nforeign political and economic events;\ndomestic and foreign interest rates and/or\ninvestor expectations concerning interest\nrates; foreign currency/exchange rates;\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation\nand taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other\npolitical upheaval and conflicts; governmental\nexpropriation; investment and trading\nactivities of mutual funds, hedge funds and\ncommodities funds; and changes in philosophies\nand emotions of market participants. The\nfrequency and magnitude of such changes cannot\nbe predicted. The prices of commodities can\nalso fluctuate widely due to supply and demand\ndisruptions in major producing or consuming\nregions. Certain commodities or natural\nresources may be produced in a limited number\nof countries and may be controlled by a small\nnumber of producers or groups of producers. As\na result, political, economic, regulatory and\nsupply-related events in such countries could\nhave a disproportionate impact on the prices\nof such commodities. A decrease in the\nproduction of a physical commodity or a\ndecrease in the volume of such commodity\navailable for transportation, mining,\nprocessing, storage or distribution may\nadversely impact the financial performance of\na commodity or commodity-related company that\ndevotes a portion of its business to that\ncommodity. Production declines and volume\ndecreases could be caused by various factors,\nincluding catastrophic events affecting\nproduction, depletion of resources, labor\ndifficulties, environmental proceedings,\nincreased regulations, equipment failures and\nunexpected maintenance problems, import supply\ndisruption, governmental expropriation,\npolitical upheaval or conflicts or increased\ncompetition from alternative energy sources or\ncommodity prices. Agricultural commodities may\nbe adversely affected by weather or other\nnatural phenomena, such as drought, floods and\npests. A sustained decline in demand for such\ncommodities could also adversely affect the\nfinancial performance of commodity-related\ncompanies. Factors that could lead to a\ndecline in demand include economic recession\nor other adverse economic conditions, higher\ntaxes on commodities or increased governmental\nregulations, increases in fuel economy,\nconsumer shifts to the use of alternative\ncommodities or fuel sources, changes in\ncommodity prices, or weather. The commodity\nmarkets are subject to temporary distortions\nand other disruptions due to, among other\nfactors, lack of liquidity, the participation\nof speculators, and government regulation and\nother actions. U.S. futures exchanges and some\nforeign exchanges limit the amount of\nfluctuation in futures contract prices which\nmay occur in a single business day (generally\nreferred to as \u201c daily price fluctuation\nlimits \u201d ). The maximum or minimum price of a\ncontract as a result of these limits is\nreferred to as a \u201c limit price. \u201d If the limit\nprice has been reached in a particular\ncontract, no trades may be made beyond the\nlimit price. Limit prices have the effect of\nprecluding trading in a particular contract or\nforcing the liquidation of contracts at\ndisadvantageous times or prices. Currency\nRisk. Because the Fund's NAV is determined on\nthe basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may\nlose money if the currency of a non-U.S.\nmarket in which the Fund invests depreciates\nagainst the U.S. dollar, even if the local\ncurrency value of the Fund\u2019s holdings in that\nmarket increases. Generally, when the U.S.\ndollar rises in value against a foreign\ncurrency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency loses value because the currency is\nworth fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, when the\nU.S.\n\n9\n\ndollar decreases in value against a foreign\ncurrency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency gains value because the currency is\nworth more U.S. dollars. This risk, generally\nknown as \u201c currency risk, \u201d means that a\nstrong U.S. dollar will reduce returns for\nU.S. investors, while a weak U.S. dollar will\nincrease those returns. Foreign exchange\ntransactions involve a significant degree of\nrisk and the markets in which foreign exchange\ntransactions are effected are highly volatile,\nhighly specialized and highly technical.\nSignificant changes, including changes in\nliquidity and prices, can occur in such\nmarkets within very short periods of time,\noften within minutes. If BFA utilizes foreign\nexchange transactions at an inappropriate time\nor judges market conditions, trends or\ncorrelations incorrectly, foreign exchange\ntransactions may not serve their intended\npurpose of improving the Fund\u2019s performance\nand may lower the Fund\u2019s return. The Fund\ncould experience losses if the value of its\ncurrency forward positions are poorly\ncorrelated with its other investments or if it\ncannot close out its positions because of an\nilliquid market. In addition, the Fund could\nincur transaction costs, including trading\ncommissions, in connection with certain\nnon-U.S. currency transactions. Custody Risk.\nCustody risk refers to the risks inherent in\nthe process of clearing and settling trades\nand to the holding of securities, cash and\nother assets by local banks, agents and\ndepositories. Low trading volumes and volatile\nprices in less developed markets make trades\nharder to complete and settle, and governments\nor trade groups may compel local agents to\nhold securities in designated depositories\nthat may not be subject to independent\nevaluation. Local agents are held only to the\nstandards of care of their local markets, and\nthus may be subject to limited or no\ngovernment oversight. Communications between\nthe U.S. and emerging market countries may be\nunreliable, increasing the risk of delayed\nsettlements or losses of security\ncertificates. In general, the less developed a\ncountry\u2019s securities market is, the greater\nthe likelihood of custody problems. Practices\nin relation to the settlement of securities\ntransactions in emerging markets involve\nhigher risks than those in developed markets,\nin part because of the use of brokers and\ncounterparties that are often less well\ncapitalized, and custody and registration of\nassets in some countries may be unreliable.\nThe possibility of fraud, negligence or undue\ninfluence being exerted by the issuer or\nrefusal to recognize ownership exists in some\nemerging markets, and, along with other\nfactors, could result in ownership\nregistration being lost. In addition, the laws\nof certain countries may put limits on the\nFund\u2019s ability to recover its assets if a\nforeign bank or depository or issuer of a\nsecurity or an agent of any of the foregoing\ngoes bankrupt. The Fund would absorb any loss\nresulting from such custody problems and may\nhave no successful claim for compensation.\nIlliquid Investments Risk. The Fund may not\nacquire any illiquid investment if,\nimmediately after the acquisition, the Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid investments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that the Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without significantly\nchanging the market value of the investment.\nThe liquidity of an investment will be\ndetermined based on relevant market, trading\nand investment specific considerations as set\nout in the Liquidity Program as required by\nthe Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may\ntrade at a discount to comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and the Fund may not be able to\ndispose of illiquid investments in a timely\nfashion or at their expected prices. If\nilliquid investments exceed 15% of the Fund\u2019s\nnet assets, the Liquidity Rule and the\nLiquidity Program will require that certain\nremedial actions be taken. Infectious Illness\nRisk. A widespread outbreak of an infectious\nillness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may\nadversely affect the economies of many nations\nand the global economy and may impact\nindividual issuers and capital markets in ways\nthat cannot be foreseen. An infectious illness\noutbreak may result in travel restrictions,\nclosed international borders, disruption of\nhealthcare services, prolonged quarantines,\ncancellations, supply chain disruptions,\ntemporary and permanent business closures,\nlower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings\ndowngrades, credit defaults and other\nsignificant economic, social and political\nimpacts, as well as general concern and\nuncertainty. An outbreak may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social and economic\nrisks in certain countries or globally. These\nimpacts, which could adversely affect a Fund\nand its investments, could be present for an\nextended period of time. In addition, markets\nmay experience temporary closures, extreme\nvolatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity\nand increased trading costs. Such events may\nadversely affect a Fund and its investments\nand may impact a Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or\nsell securities or other assets. Market or\neconomic disruptions could cause elevated\ntracking error and increased premiums or\ndiscounts to a Fund's NAV. Additionally, a\nFund could be adversely impacted if an\noutbreak impairs the operations of its service\nproviders, including BFA. Governmental and\nquasi-governmental may respond to an outbreak\nand any resulting disruptions with a variety\nof fiscal and monetary policy changes, such as\nchanges in interest rates. A reversal of these\npolicies, or the ineffectiveness of such\npolicies, is likely to increase market\nvolatility, which could adversely affect a\nFund\u2019s investments.\n\n10\n\nMoney Market Instruments Risk. The Fund may\nhold money market instruments. The value of\nmoney market instruments may be affected by\nchanges in interest rates or in the credit\nratings of the investments, among other\nthings. If a significant amount of a Fund's\nassets is invested in money market\ninstruments, it may be more difficult for the\nFund to achieve its investment objective. An\ninvestment in a money market fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. It is possible to lose money by\ninvesting in a money market fund. Money market\nfunds other than U.S. government money market\nfunds and retail money market funds \u201c float \u201d\ntheir NAV instead of using a stable $1.00 per\nshare price. Operational Risk. BFA and the\nFund's other service providers may experience\ndisruptions or operating errors such as\nprocessing errors or human errors, inadequate\nor failed internal or external processes, or\nsystems or technology failures, that could\nnegatively impact the Fund. While service\nproviders are required to have appropriate\noperational risk management policies and\nprocedures, their methods of operational risk\nmanagement may differ from the Fund\u2019s in the\nsetting of priorities, the personnel and\nresources available or the effectiveness of\nrelevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring\nand oversight of service providers, seeks to\nensure that service providers take appropriate\nprecautions to avoid and mitigate risks that\ncould lead to disruptions and operating\nerrors. However, it is not possible for BFA or\nthe other Fund service providers to identify\nall of the operational risks that may affect\nthe Fund or to develop processes and controls\nto completely eliminate or mitigate their\noccurrence or effects. Reference Rate\nReplacement Risk. The Fund may be exposed to\nfinancial instruments that recently\ntransitioned from, or continue to be tied to,\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate ( \u201c LIBOR \u201d\n) to determine payment obligations, financing\nterms, hedging strategies or investment value.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct\nAuthority ( \u201c FCA \u201d ), which regulates LIBOR,\nhas ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In\nApril 2023, however, the FCA announced that\nsome USD LIBOR settings will continue to be\npublished under a synthetic methodology until\nSeptember 30, 2024 for certain legacy\ncontracts. The Secured Overnight Financing\nRate ( \u201c SOFR \u201d ), which is a broad measure of\nthe cost of borrowing cash overnight\ncollateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in\nthe repurchase agreement market, has been used\nincreasingly on a voluntary basis in new\ninstruments and transactions. Under U.S.\nregulations that implement a statutory\nfallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark\nrates based on SOFR have replaced LIBOR in\ndifferent categories of financial contracts.\nNeither the effect of the LIBOR transition\nprocess nor its ultimate success can yet be\nknown. While some existing LIBOR-based\ninstruments may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate-setting methodology, there\nmay be significant uncertainty regarding the\neffectiveness of any such alternative\nmethodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all\nexisting LIBOR-based instruments may have\nalternative rate-setting provisions and there\nremains uncertainty regarding the willingness\nand ability of issuers to add alternative\nrate-setting provisions in certain existing\ninstruments. Parties to contracts, securities,\nor other instruments using LIBOR may disagree\non transition rates or the application of\ntransition regulation, potentially resulting\nin uncertainty of performance and the\npossibility of litigation. The Fund may have\ninstruments linked to other interbank offered\nrates that may also cease to be published in\nthe future. Risk of Derivatives. A derivative\nis a financial contract, the value of which\ndepends on, or is derived from, the value of\nan underlying asset, such as a security, a\ncommodity (such as gold or silver), a currency\nor an index (a measure of value or rates, such\nas the S&P 500 \u00ae or the prime lending rate).\nThe Fund may invest in futures contracts,\nsecurities options and other derivatives.\nCompared to securities, derivatives can be\nmore sensitive to changes in interest rates or\nto sudden fluctuations in market prices and\nthus the Fund\u2019s losses may be greater if it\ninvests in derivatives than if it invests only\nin conventional securities. Derivatives are\nalso subject to counterparty risk, which is\nthe risk that the other party in the\ntransaction will not fulfill its contractual\nobligations. Derivatives generally involve the\nincurrence of leverage. When a derivative is\nused as a hedge against a position that the\nFund holds or is committed to purchase, any\nloss generated by the derivative generally\nshould be substantially offset by gains on the\nhedged investment, and vice versa. While\nhedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can\nalso reduce or eliminate gains and, in some\ncases, hedging can cause losses that are not\noffset by gains, and the Fund will recognize\nlosses on both the investment and the hedge.\nHedges are sometimes subject to imperfect\nmatching between the derivative and the\nunderlying security, and there can be no\nassurance that the Fund's hedging\ntransactions, which entail additional\ntransaction costs, will be effective. Risk of\nEquity Securities. An investment in the Fund\nshould be made with an understanding of the\nrisks inherent in an investment in equity\nsecurities, including the risk that the\nfinancial condition of issuers may become\nimpaired or that the general condition of\nstock markets may deteriorate (either of which\nmay cause a decrease in the value of the\nportfolio securities and thus in the value of\nshares of the Fund). Common stocks are\nsusceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations\n\n11\n\nand to increases and decreases in value as\nmarket confidence and perceptions of their\nissuers change. These investor perceptions are\nbased on various and unpredictable factors,\nincluding expectations regarding government,\neconomic, monetary and fiscal policies,\ninflation and interest rates, economic\nexpansion or contraction, and global or\nregional political, economic or banking\ncrises. Common stocks may experience extreme\nprice volatility due to actions taken by\nparticular investors or groups of investors\n(for example, retail investors influenced by\nsocial media activity or other media coverage\nor significant \u201c short \u201d positions taken by\ninstitutional investors). Holders of common\nstocks incur more risks than holders of\npreferred stocks and debt obligations because\ncommon stockholders generally have rights to\nreceive payments from stock issuers that are\ninferior to the rights of creditors, or\nholders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (the value of which,\nhowever, is subject to market fluctuations\nprior to maturity), or preferred stocks, which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stocks have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity date. In addition, issuers may, in\ntimes of distress or at their own discretion,\ndecide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which\nmay also cause their stock price to decline.\nAlthough most of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index are listed on a securities\nexchange, the principal trading market for\nsome of the securities may be in the OTC\nmarket. The existence of a liquid trading\nmarket for certain securities may depend on\nwhether dealers will make a market in such\nsecurities. There can be no assurance that a\nmarket will be made or maintained or that any\nsuch market will be or remain liquid. The\nprice at which securities may be sold and the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s shares will be adversely\naffected if trading markets for the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities are limited or absent, or\nif bid/ask spreads are wide. Risk of Futures\nand Options on Futures Transactions. There are\nseveral risks accompanying the utilization of\nfutures contracts and options on futures\ncontracts. A position in futures contracts and\noptions on futures contracts may be closed\nonly on the exchange on which the contract was\nmade (or a linked exchange). While the Fund\nplans to utilize futures contracts only if an\nactive market exists for such contracts, there\nis no guarantee that a liquid market will\nexist for the contract at a specified time.\nFutures contracts, by definition, project\nprice levels in the future and not current\nlevels of valuation; therefore, market\ncircumstances may result in a discrepancy\nbetween the price of the future and the\nmovement in the Fund's Underlying Index. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, the Fund\nwould continue to be required to make daily\ncash payments to maintain its required margin.\nIn such situations, if the Fund has\ninsufficient cash, it may have to sell\nportfolio securities to meet daily margin\nrequirements at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. In addition, the\nFund may be required to deliver the\ninstruments underlying the futures contracts\nit has sold. The risk of loss in trading\nfutures contracts or uncovered call options in\nsome strategies ( e.g. , selling uncovered\nstock index futures contracts) is potentially\nunlimited. The Fund does not plan to use\nfutures and options contracts in this way. The\nrisk of a futures position may still be large\nas traditionally measured due to the low\nmargin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, intends to utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit the risk exposure to levels\ncomparable to a direct investment in the types\nof stocks in which it invests. Utilization of\nfutures and options on futures by the Fund\ninvolves the risk of imperfect or even\nnegative correlation to the Underlying Index\nif the index underlying the futures contract\ndiffers from the Underlying Index. There is\nalso the risk of loss of margin deposits in\nthe event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom\nthe Fund has an open position in the futures\ncontract or option. The purchase of put or\ncall options will be based upon predictions by\nBFA as to anticipated trends, which\npredictions could prove to be incorrect.\nBecause the futures market generally imposes\nless burdensome margin requirements than the\nsecurities market, an increased amount of\nparticipation by speculators in the futures\nmarket could result in price fluctuations.\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day.\nThe daily limit establishes the maximum amount\nby which the price of a futures contract may\nvary either up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. It is possible that futures contract\nprices could move to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting the Fund to substantial losses. In\nthe event of adverse price movements, the Fund\nwould be required to make daily cash payments\nof variation margin.\n\n12\n\nRisk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity\nSecurities. An investment in the Fund involves\nrisks similar to those of investing in\nportfolios of equity securities traded on\nnon-U.S. exchanges. These risks include market\nfluctuations caused by such factors as\neconomic and political developments in those\nforeign countries, changes in interest rates\nand perceived trends in stock prices.\nInvesting in securities issued by issuers\ndomiciled in countries other than the domicile\nof the investor and denominated in currencies\nother than an investor\u2019s local currency\nentails certain considerations and risks not\ntypically encountered by the investor in\nmaking investments in its home country and in\nthat country\u2019s currency. These considerations\ninclude favorable or unfavorable changes in\ninterest rates, currency exchange rates,\nexchange control regulations and the costs\nthat may be incurred in connection with\nconversions between various currencies.\nInvesting in the Fund also involves certain\nrisks and considerations not typically\nassociated with investing in a fund whose\nportfolio contains exclusively securities of\nU.S. issuers. These risks include generally\nless liquid and less efficient securities\nmarkets; generally greater price volatility;\nless publicly available information about\nissuers; the imposition of withholding or\nother taxes; the imposition of restrictions on\nthe expatriation of funds or other assets of\nthe Fund; higher transaction and custody\ncosts; delays and risks attendant in\nsettlement procedures; difficulties in\nenforcing contractual obligations; lower\nliquidity and significantly smaller market\ncapitalization; different accounting and\ndisclosure standards; lower levels of\nregulation of the securities markets; more\nsubstantial government interference with the\neconomy and businesses; higher rates of\ninflation; greater social, economic, and\npolitical uncertainty; the risk of\nnationalization or expropriation of assets;\nand the risk of war. Risk of Swap Agreements.\nThe risk of loss with respect to swaps is\ngenerally limited to the net amount of\npayments that the Fund is contractually\nobligated to make. Swap agreements are subject\nto the risk that the swap counterparty will\ndefault on its obligations. If such a default\noccurs, the parties will have contractual\nremedies pursuant to the agreements related to\nthe transaction. However, such remedies may be\nsubject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws,\nwhich could affect the Fund\u2019s rights as a\ncreditor ( e.g. , the Fund may not receive the\nnet amount of payments that it is\ncontractually entitled to receive). The Fund\nis required to post and collect variation\nmargin and initial margin (comprised of\nspecified liquid securities subject to\nhaircuts) in connection with trading of OTC\nswaps. These requirements may raise the costs\nfor the Fund\u2019s investment in swaps. Tracking\nError Risk. The Fund may be subject to\ntracking error, which is the divergence of the\nFund\u2019s performance from that of the Underlying\nIndex. Tracking error may occur because of\ndifferences between the securities and other\ninstruments held in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in the Underlying Index,\npricing differences, transaction costs\nincurred by the Fund, the Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in timing of the\naccrual of or the valuation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or distributions\npaid to the Fund\u2019s shareholders, the\nrequirements to maintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions carried out\nto minimize the distribution of capital gains\nto shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets,\nchanges to the Underlying Index or the costs\nto the Fund of complying with various new or\nexisting regulatory requirements. This risk\nmay be heightened during times of increased\nmarket volatility or other unusual market\nconditions. Tracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and expenses,\nwhile the Underlying Index does not. Tracking\nerror may occur due to differences between the\nmethodologies used in calculating the value of\nthe Underlying Index and determining the\nFund\u2019s NAV. When an issuer is introduced by an\nindex provider into an index tracked by a\nFund, BFA may conduct an analysis on such\nissuer\u2019s securities to identify and screen for\noutlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or\nunusual price growth that does not appear to\nbe supported by publicly available information\non the business and assets of the issuer,\nunusual or significant short interest or\nlending activity, negative sentiment,\nsuspended trading or incorrect free-float\ncalculations, which could be indicators of\npossible irregularities, miscalculations or\neven fraud). If it identifies such behavior,\nBFA may, where appropriate, alert the index\nprovider as to the alleged issue. The index\nprovider has sole discretion for the\ndetermination as to whether to continue to\ninclude the issuer\u2019s securities in the\nrebalancing of its index. If the securities\ncontinue to be included in the index, BFA may\nunderweight or exclude such securities from a\nFund\u2019s portfolio and, if it does so, such Fund\nwill be subject to increased tracking error\ndue to the divergence in the securities\nincluded in its portfolio from its underlying\nindex. The application of the abovementioned\nanalysis and screening to a Fund and its\nUnderlying Index is in the sole discretion of\nBFA and its affiliates (without any\nguarantees). The analysis and screening may\nnot exclude any or all high risk securities\nfrom an Underlying Index or a Fund\u2019s\nportfolio, and the inclusion of such\nsecurities will result in an adverse impact to\nthe Fund\u2019s net asset value if one or more such\nsecurities declines in value.\n\n13\n\nVolatility Risk. The value of a security may\nfluctuate due to factors affecting markets\ngenerally or particular industries. This\nvolatility may affect the Fund's NAV.\nSecurities in the the Fund's portfolio may be\nsubject to price volatility and their prices\nmay not be any less volatile than the market\nas a whole and could be more volatile. Events\nor financial circumstances affecting\nindividual securities or sectors may increase\nthe volatility of the Fund. Risk of Investing\nin Africa. Investments in securities of\nissuers in certain African countries involve\nheightened risks including, among others,\nexpropriation and/or nationalization of\nassets, confiscatory taxation, political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict, civil war, and social\ninstability as a result of religious, ethnic\nand/or socio-economic unrest or widespread\noutbreaks of disease and, in certain\ncountries, genocidal warfare. Certain\ncountries in Africa generally have less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries, and, consequently,\nthe risks of investing in foreign securities\nare magnified in such countries. Because\nsecurities markets of countries in Africa are\ngenerally underdeveloped and are generally\nless correlated to global economic cycles than\nthose markets located in more developed\ncountries, securities markets in African\ncountries are subject to greater risks\nassociated with market volatility, lower\nmarket capitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations and uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets. Moreover,\ntrading on African securities markets may be\nsuspended altogether. Market volatility may\nalso be heightened by the actions of a small\nnumber of investors. Brokerage firms in\ncertain countries in Africa may be fewer in\nnumber and less established than brokerage\nfirms in more developed markets. Since the\nFund may need to effect securities\ntransactions through these brokerage firms,\nthe Fund is subject to the risk that these\nbrokerage firms will not be able to fulfill\ntheir obligations to the Fund ( i.e.,\ncounterparty risk). This risk is magnified to\nthe extent that the Fund effects securities\ntransactions through a single brokerage firm\nor a small number of brokerage firms. Certain\ngovernments in African countries restrict or\ncontrol to varying degrees the ability of\nforeign investors to invest in securities of\nissuers located or operating in those\ncountries. Moreover, certain countries in\nAfrica require governmental approval or\nspecial licenses prior to investment by\nforeign investors and may limit the amount of\ninvestment by foreign investors in a\nparticular industry and/or issuer, and may\nlimit such foreign investment to a certain\nclass of securities of an issuer that may have\nless advantageous rights than the classes\navailable for purchase by domestic investors\nof the countries and/or impose additional\ntaxes on foreign investors. A delay in\nobtaining a government approval or a license\nwould delay investments in a particular\ncountry, and, as a result, the Fund may not be\nable to invest in certain securities while\napproval is pending. The government of a\nparticular country may also withdraw or\ndecline to renew a license that enables the\nFund to invest in such country. These factors\nmake investing in issuers located or operating\nin countries in Africa significantly riskier\nthan investing in issuers located or operating\nin more developed countries, and any one of\nthese factors could cause a decline in the\nvalue of the Fund investments. Issuers located\nor operating in countries in Africa are\ngenerally not subject to the same rules and\nregulations as issuers located or operating in\nmore developed countries. Therefore, there may\nbe less financial and other information\npublicly available with regard to issuers\nlocated or operating in countries in Africa\nand such issuers are generally not subject to\nthe uniform accounting, auditing and financial\nreporting standards applicable to issuers\nlocated or operating in more developed\ncountries. In addition, governments of certain\ncountries in Africa in which the Fund may\ninvest may levy withholding or other taxes on\nincome such as dividends, interest and\nrealized capital gains. Although in certain\ncountries in Africa a portion of these taxes\nare recoverable, the non-recovered portion of\nforeign withholding taxes will reduce the\nincome received from investments in such\ncountries. Investment in countries in Africa\nmay be subject to a greater degree of risk\nassociated with governmental approval in\nconnection with the repatriation of investment\nincome, capital or the proceeds of sales of\nsecurities by foreign investors. In addition,\nthere is the risk that if an African country\u2019s\nbalance of payments declines, such African\ncountry may impose temporary restrictions on\nforeign capital remittances. Consequently, the\nFund could be adversely affected by delays in,\nor a refusal to grant, required governmental\napproval for repatriation of capital, as well\nas by the application to the Fund of any\nrestrictions on investments. Additionally,\ninvestments in countries in Africa may require\nthe Fund to adopt special procedures, seek\nlocal government approvals or take other\nactions, each of which may involve additional\ncosts to the Fund. Securities laws in many\ncountries in Africa are relatively new and\nunsettled and, consequently, there is a risk\nof rapid and unpredictable change in laws\nregarding foreign investment, securities\nregulation, title to securities and\nshareholder rights. Accordingly, foreign\ninvestors may be adversely affected by new or\namended laws and regulations. In addition,\nthere may be\n\n14\n\nno single centralized securities exchange on\nwhich securities are traded in certain\ncountries in Africa and the systems of\ncorporate governance to which issuers located\nin countries in Africa are subject may be less\nadvanced than those systems to which issuers\nlocated in more developed countries are\nsubject, and, therefore, shareholders of\nissuers located in such countries may not\nreceive many of the protections available to\nshareholders of issuers located in more\ndeveloped countries. Even in circumstances\nwhere adequate laws and shareholder rights\nexist, it may not be possible to obtain swift\nand equitable enforcement of the law. In\naddition, the enforcement of systems of\ntaxation at federal, regional and local levels\nin countries in Africa may be inconsistent and\nsubject to sudden change. Certain countries in\nAfrica may be heavily dependent upon\ninternational trade and, consequently, have\nbeen and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. Certain countries in Africa\ndepend to a significant extent upon exports of\nprimary commodities such as gold, silver,\ncopper and diamonds. These countries therefore\nare vulnerable to changes in commodity prices,\nwhich may be affected by a variety of factors.\nIn addition, certain issuers located in\ncountries in Africa in which the Fund invests\nmay operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer which operates in, or\nhas dealings with, such countries. The Fund,\nas an investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. The\ngovernments of certain countries in Africa may\nexercise substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Future government\nactions could have a significant effect on the\neconomic conditions in such countries, which\ncould have a negative impact on private sector\ncompanies. There is also the possibility of\ndiplomatic developments that could adversely\naffect investments in certain countries in\nAfrica. Some countries in Africa may be\naffected by a greater degree of public\ncorruption and crime, including organized\ncrime. Political instability and protests in\nNorth Africa and the Middle East have caused\nand may in the future cause significant\ndisruptions to many industries. In addition,\nthe outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa\nseverely challenged health care industries in\nthose countries and adversely impacted the\nregion\u2019s economy due to quarantines and\ndisruptions of trade, which has further\nincreased instability in the region. This\ninstability has demonstrated that political\nand social unrest can spread quickly through\nthe region, and that developments in one\ncountry can influence the political events in\nneighboring countries. Some protests have\nturned violent, and civil war and political\nreconstruction in certain countries such as\nLibya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to\ninvestments in the region. Continued political\nand social unrest in these regions, including\nthe ongoing warfare and terrorist activities\nin the Middle East and Africa, may negatively\naffect the value of an investment in the Fund.\nRisk of Investing in Asia. Investments in\nsecurities of issuers in certain Asian\ncountries involve risks not typically\nassociated with investments in securities of\nissuers in other regions. Such heightened\nrisks include, among others, expropriation\nand/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory\ntaxation, piracy of intellectual property,\ndata and other security breaches (especially\nof data stored electronically), political\ninstability, including authoritarian and/or\nmilitary involvement in governmental decision-\nmaking, armed conflict and social instability\nas a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-\neconomic unrest. Certain Asian economies have\nexperienced rapid rates of economic growth and\nindustrialization in recent years, and there\nis no assurance that these rates of economic\ngrowth and industrialization will be\nmaintained. Certain Asian countries have\ndemocracies with relatively short histories,\nwhich may increase the risk of political\ninstability. These countries have faced\npolitical and military unrest, and further\nunrest could present a risk to their local\neconomies and securities markets. Indonesia\nand the Philippines have each experienced\nviolence and terrorism, which has negatively\nimpacted their economies. North Korea and\nSouth Korea each have substantial military\ncapabilities, and historical tensions between\nthe two countries present the risk of war.\nEscalated tensions involving the two countries\nand any outbreak of hostilities between the\ntwo countries, or even the threat of an\noutbreak of hostilities, could have a severe\nadverse effect on the entire Asian region.\nCertain Asian countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect Asian issuers that\nrely on the U.S. for trade. Political,\nreligious, and border disputes persist in\nIndia. India has recently experienced and may\ncontinue to experience civil unrest and\nhostilities with certain of its neighboring\ncountries. Increased political and social\nunrest in these geographic areas could\nadversely affect the performance of\ninvestments in this region.\n\n15\n\nCertain governments in this region administer\nprices on several basic goods, including fuel\nand electricity, within their respective\ncountries. Certain governments may exercise\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector in their respective countries\nand may own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in this\nregion, which in turn could have a negative\nimpact on private sector companies. There is\nalso the possibility of diplomatic\ndevelopments adversely affecting investments\nin the region. Corruption and the perceived\nlack of a rule of law in dealings with\ninternational companies in certain Asian\ncountries may discourage foreign investment\nand could negatively impact the long-term\ngrowth of certain economies in this region. In\naddition, certain countries in the region are\nexperiencing high unemployment and corruption,\nand have fragile banking sectors. Some\neconomies in this region are dependent on a\nrange of commodities, including oil, natural\ngas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly\naffected by international commodity prices and\nparticularly vulnerable to any weakening in\nglobal demand for these products. The market\nfor securities in this region may also be\ndirectly influenced by the flow of\ninternational capital, and by the economic and\nmarket conditions of neighboring countries.\nChina is a key trading partner of many Asian\ncountries and any changes in trading\nrelationships between China and other Asian\ncountries may affect the region as a whole.\nAdverse economic conditions or developments in\nneighboring countries may increase investors'\nperception of the risk of investing in the\nregion as a whole, which may adversely impact\nthe market value of the securities issued by\ncompanies in the region. Risk of Investing in\nAustralasia. The economies of Australasia,\nwhich include Australia and New Zealand, are\ndependent on exports from the agricultural and\nmining sectors. This makes Australasian\neconomies susceptible to fluctuations in the\ncommodity markets. Australasian economies are\nalso increasingly dependent on their growing\nservice and tourism industries. Australia and\nNew Zealand are located in a part of the world\nthat has historically been prone to natural\ndisasters, such as drought and flooding. Any\nsuch event in the future could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the economies of\nAustralia and New Zealand and affect the value\nof securities held by the Fund. The economies\nof Australia and New Zealand are dependent on\ntrading with certain key trading partners,\nincluding Asia and the U.S. Economic events in\nthe U.S., Asia, or in other key trading\ncountries can have a significant economic\neffect on the Australasian economies. The\neconomies of Australia and New Zealand are\nheavily dependent on the mining sector.\nPassage of new regulations limiting foreign\nownership of companies in the mining sector or\nimposition of new taxes on profits of mining\ncompanies may dissuade foreign investment, and\nas a result, have a negative impact on\ncompanies to which the Fund has exposure. Risk\nof Investing in Central and South America. The\neconomies of certain countries in which the\nFund invests are affected by the economies of\nother Central and South American countries,\nsome of which have experienced high interest\nrates, economic volatility, inflation,\ncurrency devaluations, government defaults,\nhigh unemployment rates and political\ninstability which can adversely affect issuers\nin these countries. In addition, commodities\n(such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a\nsignificant percentage of exports for the\nregions and many economies in these regions\nare particularly sensitive to fluctuations in\ncommodity prices. Adverse economic events in\none country may have a significant adverse\neffect on some or all of the countries to\nwhich the Fund has exposure. The governments\nof certain countries in Central and South\nAmerica may exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector and\nmay own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in such\ncountries, which could have a negative impact\non the securities in which a Fund invests.\nDiplomatic developments may also adversely\naffect investments in certain countries in\nCentral and South America. Some countries in\nCentral and South America may be affected by\npublic corruption and crime, including\norganized crime. Certain countries in Central\nand South America may be heavily dependent\nupon international trade and, consequently,\nhave been and may continue to be negatively\naffected by trade barriers, exchange controls,\nmanaged adjustments in relative currency\nvalues and other protectionist measures\nimposed or negotiated by the countries with\nwhich they trade. These countries also have\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected\nby economic conditions in the countries with\nwhich they trade. In addition, certain issuers\nlocated in countries in Central and South\nAmerica in which a Fund invests may be the\nsubject of sanctions (for example, the U.S.\nhas imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan\nindividuals, corporate entities and the\nVenezuelan government) or have dealings with\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations and/or countries identified\nby the U.S. government as state sponsors of\nterrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its\nreputation if it is identified as an issuer\nthat has dealings with such countries. A Fund\nmay be adversely affected if it invests in\nsuch issuers.\n\n16\n\nRisk of Investing in China. Investments in\nsecurities of companies domiciled in China\ninvolve a high degree of risk and special\nconsiderations not typically associated with\ninvesting in the U.S. securities markets. Such\nheightened risks include, among others, an\nauthoritarian government, popular unrest\nassociated with demands for improved\npolitical, economic and social conditions, the\nimpact of regional conflict on the economy and\nhostile relations with neighboring countries.\nMilitary conflicts, either in response to\ninternal social unrest or conflicts with other\ncountries, could disrupt economic development.\nThe Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-\nrunning disagreements and religious and\nnationalist disputes with Tibet and the\nXinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been\ntensions between the Chinese government and\nmany people in Hong Kong who perceive China as\ntightening control over Hong Kong\u2019s semi-\nautonomous liberal political, economic, legal,\nand social framework. Recent protests and\nunrest have increased tensions even further.\nDue to the interconnected nature of the Hong\nKong and Chinese economies, this instability\nin Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong\nKong and Chinese markets. China has a complex\nterritorial dispute regarding the sovereignty\nof Taiwan and has made threats of invasion.\nTaiwan-based companies and individuals are\nsignificant investors in China. Military\nconflict between China and Taiwan may\nadversely affect securities of Chinese\nissuers. In addition, China has strained\ninternational relations with Japan, India,\nRussia and other neighbors due to territorial\ndisputes, historical animosities and other\ndefense concerns. Additionally, China is\nalleged to have participated in state-\nsponsored cyberattacks against foreign\ncompanies and foreign governments. Actual and\nthreatened responses to such activity and\nstrained international relations, including\npurchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Chinese government or\nChinese companies, may impact China\u2019s economy\nand Chinese issuers of securities in which the\nFund invests. China could be affected by\nmilitary events on the Korean peninsula or\ninternal instability within North Korea. These\nsituations may cause uncertainty in the\nChinese market and may adversely affect the\nperformance of the Chinese economy. The\nChinese government has implemented significant\neconomic reforms in order to liberalize trade\npolicy, promote foreign investment in the\neconomy, reduce government control of the\neconomy and develop market mechanisms.\nHowever, the Chinese government still\nexercises substantial influence over many\naspects of the private sector and may own or\ncontrol many companies. Chinese companies,\nsuch as those in the financial services or\ntechnology sectors, and potentially other\nsectors in the future, are subject to the risk\nthat Chinese authorities can intervene in\ntheir operations and structure. The Chinese\ngovernment continues to maintain a major role\nin economic policymaking. Investing in China\ninvolves risk of loss due to expropriation,\nnationalization, confiscation of assets and\nproperty or the imposition of restrictions on\nforeign investments and on repatriation of\ncapital invested. In addition, there is less\nregulation and monitoring of Chinese\nsecurities markets and the activities of\ninvestors, brokers and other participants than\nin the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities\nin China, including Chinese companies that are\nlisted on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to\nthe same degree of regulation as are U.S.\nissuers with respect to such matters as\ninsider trading rules, tender offer\nregulation, accounting standards or auditor\noversight, stockholder proxy requirements and\nthe requirements mandating timely and accurate\ndisclosure of information. Securities markets\nin China are in the process of change and\nfurther development. This may lead to trading\nvolatility, difficulty in the settlement and\nrecording of transactions and difficulty in\ninterpreting and applying the relevant\nregulation. There may be significant obstacles\nto obtaining information necessary for\ninvestigations into or litigation against\nChinese companies, and shareholders may have\nlimited legal remedies. The Fund does not\nselect investments based on investor\nprotection considerations. While the Chinese\neconomy has experienced past periods of rapid\ngrowth, there is no assurance that such growth\nrates will recur. China may experience\nsubstantial rates of inflation, significant\nindebtedness or economic recessions, causing a\nnegative effect on the economy and securities\nmarket. China\u2019s economy is heavily dependent\non export growth. Reduction in spending on\nChinese products and services, supply chain\ndiversification, institution of additional\ntariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers or\na downturn in any of the economies of China\u2019s\nkey trading partners may have an adverse\nimpact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese\nissuers of securities in which a Fund invests.\nFor example, the U.S. has added certain\nforeign technology companies to the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry\nand Security\u2019s \u201c Entity List, \u201d which is a\nlist of companies believed to pose a national\nsecurity risk to the U.S. Actions like these\nmay have unanticipated and disruptive effects\non the Chinese economy. Any such response that\ntargets Chinese financial markets or\nsecurities exchanges could interfere with\norderly trading, delay settlement or cause\nmarket disruptions.\n\n17\n\nRisk of Investing in Developed Countries. Many\ncountries with developed markets have recently\nexperienced significant economic pressures.\nThese countries generally tend to rely on the\nservices sectors ( e.g. , the financial\nservices sector) as the primary source of\neconomic growth and may be susceptible to the\nrisks of individual service sectors. For\nexample, companies in the financial services\nsector are subject to governmental regulation\nand, recently, government intervention, which\nmay adversely affect the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and\namount of capital they must maintain.\nDislocations in the financial sector and\nperceived or actual governmental influence\nover certain financial companies may lead to\ncredit rating downgrades and, as a result,\nimpact, among other things, revenue growth for\nsuch companies. If financial companies\nexperience a prolonged decline in revenue\ngrowth, certain developed countries that rely\nheavily on financial companies as an economic\ndriver may experience a correlative slowdown.\nConcerns have emerged with respect to the\neconomic health of certain developed\ncountries. These concerns primarily stem from\nheavy indebtedness of many developed countries\nand their perceived inability to continue to\nservice high debt loads without simultaneously\nimplementing stringent austerity measures.\nSuch concerns have led to tremendous downward\npressure on the economies of these countries.\nAs a result, it is possible that interest\nrates on debt of certain developed countries\nmay rise to levels that make it difficult for\nsuch countries to service such debt. Spending\non health care and retirement pensions in most\ndeveloped countries has risen dramatically.\nMedical innovation, extended life expectancy\nand higher public expectations are likely to\ncontinue the increase in health care and\npension costs. Any increase in health care and\npension costs will likely have a negative\nimpact on the economic growth of many\ndeveloped countries. Certain developed\ncountries rely on imports of certain key\nitems, such as crude oil, natural gas, and\nother commodities. As a result, an increase in\ndemand for, or price fluctuations of, certain\ncommodities may negatively affect developed\ncountry economies. Developed market countries\ngenerally are dependent on the economies of\ncertain key trading partners. Changes in any\none economy may cause an adverse impact on\nseveral developed countries. In addition,\nheavy regulation of, among others, labor and\nproduct markets may have an adverse effect on\ncertain issuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth or cause\nprolonged periods of recession. Such risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investments. Risk of Investing\nin Eastern Europe. Investing in the securities\nof issuers located or operating in Eastern\nEurope is highly speculative and involves\nrisks not usually associated with investing in\nthe more developed markets of Western Europe.\nCertain Eastern European countries have high\npublic debt levels, significant underground\neconomies, high unemployment and emigration of\nskilled workers. Such countries generally have\na history of political instability, limited\ninfrastructure and an inefficient public\nsector prone to endemic corruption. Political\nand economic reforms are too recent to\nestablish a definite trend away from centrally\nplanned economies and state-owned industries.\nIn the past, some Eastern European governments\nhave expropriated substantial amounts of\nprivate property, and many claims of the\nproperty owners have never been fully settled.\nMany Eastern European countries continue to\nmove toward market economies at different\npaces with different characteristics. Many\nEastern European securities markets are\ngenerally underdeveloped with low, irregular\ntrading volumes, dubious investor protections,\nand often a dearth of reliable corporate\ninformation. Eastern European securities\nmarkets are generally subject to less\ngovernment supervision and regulation and may\nbe less liquid and more volatile than\nsecurities markets in the U.S. or Western\nEuropean countries. Legal institutions\ngoverning private and foreign investments and\nprivate property may be relatively nascent,\ninefficient, and unevenly enforced or\ninequitably enforced. Certain Eastern European\ngovernments may exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector and\nmay own or control many companies. Future\ngovernment actions could have a significant\neffect on the economic conditions in such\ncountries, which could have a negative impact\non the Fund\u2019s investments. Information and\ntransaction costs, differential taxes, and\nsometimes political or transfer risk give a\ncomparative advantage to the domestic investor\nrather than the foreign investor. Eastern\nEuropean economies may also be particularly\nsusceptible to changes in the international\ncredit markets due to their reliance on bank\nrelated inflows of capital. Changes to the\neconomies of countries with substantial\nforeign direct investment in certain Eastern\nEuropean countries may negatively affect the\nregion\u2019s economy. The economy of certain\nEastern European countries may be adversely\naffected by global prices for manufactured\ngoods or commodity price declines to the\nextent that a country relies on the export of\nsuch products. Geopolitical events, including\nwar, and other instability in certain Eastern\nEuropean countries may cause uncertainty in\nthe region\u2019s financial markets and adversely\naffect the performance of the issuers to which\nthe Fund has exposure. These markets may be\nparticularly sensitive to social, political,\neconomic, and currency events in Russia and\nmay suffer heavy losses as a result of their\ntrading and investment links to the Russian\neconomy and currency. Russia has historically\nasserted its influence in the region using\ndiplomatic, informational, military, and\neconomic instruments of national power, as it\ndid with Georgia in the summer of 2008 and\nUkraine beginning in 2014, and most recently\non February 24, 2022.\n\n18\n\nRussian Invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally. Risk\nof Investing in Emerging Markets. Investments\nin emerging market countries may be subject to\ngreater risks than investments in developed\ncountries. These risks include: (i) less\nsocial, political, and economic stability;\n(ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility\ndue to smaller or limited local capital\nmarkets for such securities, or low or non-\nexistent trading volumes; (iii) companies,\ncustodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges\nand broker-dealers may be subject to less\nscrutiny and regulation by local authorities;\n(iv) local governments may decide to seize or\nconfiscate securities held by foreign\ninvestors and/or local governments may decide\nto suspend or limit an issuer's ability to\nmake dividend or interest payments; (v) local\ngovernments may limit or entirely restrict\nrepatriation of invested capital, profits, and\ndividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject\nto local taxation, including on a retroactive\nbasis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on\nstandard payments imposed by local governments\nmay attempt to make dividend or interest\npayments to foreign investors in the local\ncurrency; (viii) there may be significant\nobstacles to obtaining information necessary\nfor investigations into or litigation against\ncompanies and investors may experience\ndifficulty in enforcing legal claims related\nto the securities and/or local judges may\nfavor the interests of the issuer over those\nof foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments\nmay only be permitted to be paid in the local\ncurrency; (x) limited public information\nregarding the issuer may result in greater\ndifficulty in determining market valuations of\nthe securities; and (xi) lack of financial\nreporting on a regular basis, substandard\ndisclosure and differences in accounting\nstandards may make it difficult to ascertain\nthe financial health of an issuer. The Fund is\nnot actively managed and does not select\ninvestments based on investor protection\nconsiderations. Emerging market securities\nmarkets are typically marked by a high\nconcentration of market capitalization and\ntrading volume in a small number of issuers\nrepresenting a limited number of industries,\nas well as a high concentration of ownership\nof such securities by a limited number of\ninvestors. In addition, brokerage and other\ncosts associated with transactions in emerging\nmarket securities can be higher, sometimes\nsignificantly, than similar costs incurred in\nsecurities markets in developed countries.\nAlthough some emerging markets have become\nmore established and tend to issue securities\nof higher credit quality, the markets for\nsecurities in other emerging market countries\nare in the earliest stages of their\ndevelopment, and these countries issue\nsecurities across the credit spectrum. Even\nthe markets for relatively widely traded\nsecurities in emerging market countries may\nnot be able to absorb, without price\ndisruptions, a significant increase in trading\nvolume or trades of a size customarily\nundertaken by institutional investors in the\nsecurities markets of developed countries. The\nlimited size of many of these securities\nmarkets can cause prices to be erratic for\nreasons apart from factors that affect the\nsoundness and competitiveness of the\nsecurities issuers. For example, prices may be\nunduly influenced by traders who control large\npositions in these markets. Additionally,\nmarket making and arbitrage activities are\ngenerally less extensive in such markets,\nwhich may contribute to increased volatility\nand reduced liquidity of such markets. The\nlimited liquidity of emerging market country\nsecurities may also affect the Fund's ability\nto accurately value its portfolio securities\nor to acquire or dispose of securities at the\nprice and time it wishes to do so or in order\nto meet redemption requests. Many emerging\nmarket countries suffer from uncertainty and\ncorruption in their legal frameworks.\nLegislation may be difficult to interpret and\nlaws may be too new to provide any\nprecedential value. Laws regarding foreign\ninvestment and private property may be weak or\nnon-existent. Sudden changes in governments\nmay result in policies which are less\nfavorable to investors such as policies\ndesigned to expropriate or nationalize \u201c\nsovereign \u201d assets. Certain emerging market\ncountries in the past have expropriated large\namounts of private property, in many cases\nwith little or no compensation, and there can\nbe no assurance that such expropriation will\nnot occur in the future. Investment in the\nsecurities markets of certain emerging market\ncountries is restricted or controlled to\nvarying degrees. These restrictions may limit\nthe Fund's investment in certain emerging\nmarket countries and may increase the expenses\nof the Fund. Certain emerging market countries\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestments by foreign persons or limit\n\n19\n\ninvestment by foreign persons to only a\nspecified percentage of an issuer's\noutstanding securities or a specific class of\nsecurities which may have less advantageous\nterms (including price) than securities of the\ncompany available for purchase by nationals.\nMany emerging market countries lack the\nsocial, political, and economic stability\ncharacteristic of the U.S. Political\ninstability among emerging market countries\ncan be common and may be caused by an uneven\ndistribution of wealth, social unrest, labor\nstrikes, civil wars, and religious oppression.\nEconomic instability in emerging market\ncountries may take the form of: (i) high\ninterest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation,\nincluding hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of\nunemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes\nin government economic and tax policies,\nincluding confiscatory taxation; and (v)\nimposition of trade barriers. The Fund's\nincome and, in some cases, capital gains from\nforeign securities will be subject to\napplicable taxation in certain of the emerging\nmarket countries in which it invests, and\ntreaties between the U.S. and such countries\nmay not be available in some cases to reduce\nthe otherwise applicable tax rates. Emerging\nmarkets also have different clearance and\nsettlement procedures, and in certain of these\nemerging markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of securities transactions, making\nit difficult to conduct such transactions. In\nthe past, certain governments in emerging\nmarket countries have become overly reliant on\nthe international capital markets and other\nforms of foreign credit to finance large\npublic spending programs, which in the past\nhave caused huge budget deficits. Often,\ninterest payments have become too overwhelming\nfor a government to meet, representing a large\npercentage of total GDP. These foreign\nobligations have become the subject of\npolitical debate and served as fuel for\npolitical parties of the opposition, which\npressure the government not to make payments\nto foreign creditors, but instead to use these\nfunds for, among other things, social\nprograms. Either due to an inability to pay or\nsubmission to political pressure, foreign\ngovernments have been forced to seek a\nrestructuring of their loan and/or bond\nobligations, have declared a temporary\nsuspension of interest payments or have\ndefaulted. These events have adversely\naffected the values of securities issued by\nforeign governments and corporations domiciled\nin those countries and have negatively\naffected not only their cost of borrowing, but\ntheir ability to borrow in the future as well.\nRisk of Investing in Europe. Investing in\nEuropean countries exposes the Fund to the\neconomic and political risks associated with\nEurope in general and the specific European\ncountries in which it invests. The economies\nand markets of European countries are often\nclosely connected and interdependent, and\nevents in one European country can have an\nadverse impact on other European countries.\nThe Fund makes investments in securities of\nissuers that are domiciled in, have\nsignificant operations in, or that are listed\non at least one securities exchange within\nmember states of the European Union (the \u201c EU\n\u201d ). A number of countries within the EU are\nalso members of the Economic and Monetary\nUnion (the \u201c eurozone \u201d ) and have adopted the\neuro as their currency. Eurozone membership\nrequires member states to comply with\nrestrictions on inflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates, debt levels and fiscal and\nmonetary controls, each of which may\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe.\nChanges in import or export tariffs, changes\nin governmental or EU regulations on trade,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro and\nother currencies of certain EU countries which\nare not in the eurozone, the default or threat\nof default by an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt, and/or an economic recession\nin an EU member state may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other EU\nmember states and their trading partners.\nAlthough certain European countries are not in\nthe eurozone, many of these countries are\nobliged to meet the criteria for joining the\neurozone. Consequently, these countries must\ncomply with many of the restrictions noted\nabove. The European financial markets have\nexperienced volatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic downturns,\ngovernment debt levels and the possible\ndefault of government debt in several European\ncountries, including, but not limited to,\nAustria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.\nIn order to prevent further economic\ndeterioration, certain countries, without\nprior warning, can institute \u201c capital\ncontrols. \u201d Countries may use these controls\nto restrict volatile movements of capital\nentering and exiting their country. Such\ncontrols may negatively affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. A default or debt restructuring\nby any European country would adversely impact\nholders of that country\u2019s debt and sellers of\ncredit default swaps linked to that country\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, which may be located in\ncountries other than those listed above. In\naddition, the credit ratings of certain\nEuropean countries were downgraded in the\npast. These events have adversely affected the\nvalue and exchange rate of the euro and may\ncontinue to significantly affect the economies\nof every country in Europe, including\ncountries that do not use the euro and non-EU\nmember states. Responses to the financial\nproblems by European governments, central\nbanks and others, including austerity measures\nand reforms, may not produce the desired\n\n20\n\nresults, may result in social unrest and may\nlimit future growth and economic recovery or\nhave other unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The impact of these actions, especially if\nthey occur in a disorderly fashion, is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely impact the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investments in the region. The\nUnited Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d ) left the EU ( \u201c\nBrexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could\nadversely affect European or worldwide\npolitical, regulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute to instability\nin global political institutions, regulatory\nagencies and financial markets. Certain\nEuropean countries have also developed\nincreasingly strained relationships with the\nU.S., and if these relations were to worsen,\nthey could adversely affect European issuers\nthat rely on the U.S. for trade. The national\npolitics of countries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to influence by\ndisruptive political groups and ideologies,\nincluding for example, secessionist movements.\nThe governments of European countries may be\nsubject to change and such countries may\nexperience social and political unrest.\nUnanticipated or sudden political or social\ndevelopments may result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses. The occurrence\nof terrorist incidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region also could impact financial\nmarkets. The impact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant and far-\nreaching and could adversely affect the value\nand liquidity of the Fund's investments.\nRussian Invasion of Ukraine . Russia launched\na large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February\n24, 2022. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market disruptions, including\ndeclines in its stock markets and the value of\nthe ruble against the U.S. dollar, are\nimpossible to predict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused by Russian\nmilitary action or other actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or resulting\nactual and threatened responses to such\nactivity, including purchasing and financing\nrestrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer\nor purchaser preferences, sanctions, import\nand export restrictions, tariffs or\ncyberattacks on the Russian government,\nRussian companies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact Russia's\neconomy, Russian issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and threatened\nresponses to Russian military action may also\nimpact the markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and natural gas, as\nwell as other sectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral impacts on\nsuch sectors across Europe and globally. Risk\nof Investing in the Middle East. Many Middle\nEastern countries have little or no democratic\ntradition, and the political and legal systems\nin such countries may have an adverse impact\non the Fund. Many economies in the Middle East\nare highly reliant on income from the sale of\noil and natural gas or trade with countries\ninvolved in the sale of oil and natural gas,\nand their economies are therefore vulnerable\nto changes in the market for oil and natural\ngas and foreign currency values. As global\ndemand for oil and natural gas fluctuates,\nmany Middle Eastern economies may be\nsignificantly impacted. In addition, many\nMiddle Eastern governments have exercised and\ncontinue to exercise substantial influence\nover many aspects of the private sector. In\ncertain cases, a Middle Eastern country\u2019s\ngovernment may own or control many companies,\nincluding some of the largest companies in the\ncountry. Accordingly, governmental actions in\nthe future could have a significant effect on\neconomic conditions in Middle Eastern\ncountries. This could affect private sector\ncompanies and the Fund, as well as the value\nof securities in the Fund's portfolio. Certain\nMiddle Eastern markets are in the earliest\nstages of development. As a result, there may\nbe a high concentration of market\ncapitalization and trading volume in a small\nnumber of issuers representing a limited\nnumber of industries, as well as a high\nconcentration of investors and financial\nintermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern\ncountries typically are fewer in number and\nless capitalized than brokers in the U.S. The\nlegal systems in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries also may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund. For example, the potential liability\nof a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with\nrespect to acts of the corporation generally\nis limited to the amount of the shareholder\u2019s\ninvestment. However, the notion of limited\nliability is less clear in certain Middle\nEastern countries. The Fund therefore may be\nliable in certain Middle Eastern countries for\nthe acts of a corporation in which it invests\nfor an amount greater than its actual\ninvestment in that corporation. Similarly, the\nrights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers\nmay be more limited than those of shareholders\nof a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to obtain or enforce a legal\njudgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some\nMiddle Eastern countries prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on investments in\ntheir capital markets, particularly their\nequity markets, by foreign entities such as\nthe Fund. For example, certain countries may\nrequire governmental approval prior to\ninvestment by foreign persons or limit the\namount of\n\n21\n\ninvestment by foreign persons in a particular\nissuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may\nalso limit investment by foreign persons to\nonly a specific class of securities of an\nissuer that may have less advantageous terms\n(including price) than securities of the\nissuer available for purchase by nationals of\nthe relevant Middle Eastern country. The\nmanner in which foreign investors may invest\nin companies in certain Middle Eastern\ncountries, as well as limitations on those\ninvestments, may have an adverse impact on the\noperations of the Fund. For example, in\ncertain of these countries, the Fund may be\nrequired to invest initially through a local\nbroker or other entity and then have the\nshares that were purchased re-registered in\nthe name of the Fund. Re-registration in some\ninstances may not be possible on a timely\nbasis. This may result in a delay during which\nthe Fund may be denied certain of its rights\nas an investor, including rights as to\ndividends or to be made aware of certain\ncorporate actions. There also may be instances\nwhere the Fund places a purchase order but is\nsubsequently informed, at the time of re-\nregistration, that the permissible allocation\nof the investment to foreign investors has\nalready been filled and, consequently, the\nFund may not be able to invest in the relevant\ncompany. Substantial limitations may exist in\ncertain Middle Eastern countries with respect\nto the Fund\u2019s ability to repatriate investment\nincome or capital gains. The Fund could be\nadversely affected by delays in, or a refusal\nto grant, any required governmental approval\nfor repatriation of capital, as well as by the\napplication to the Fund of any restrictions on\ninvestment. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nmay be heavily dependent upon international\ntrade and, consequently, have been and may\ncontinue to be negatively affected by trade\nbarriers, exchange controls, managed\nadjustments in relative currency values and\nother protectionist measures imposed or\nnegotiated by the countries with which they\ntrade. These countries also have been and may\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by economic\nconditions in the countries with which they\ntrade. In addition, certain issuers located in\nMiddle Eastern countries in which the Fund\ninvests may operate in, or have dealings with,\ncountries subject to sanctions and/or\nembargoes imposed by the U.S. government and\nthe United Nations, and/or countries\nidentified by the U.S. government as state\nsponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer\nmay sustain damage to its reputation if it is\nidentified as an issuer which operates in, or\nhas dealings with, such countries. The Fund,\nas an investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. Certain\nMiddle Eastern countries have strained\nrelations with other Middle Eastern countries\ndue to territorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, international alliances, defense\nconcerns or other reasons, which may adversely\naffect the economies of these Middle Eastern\ncountries. Certain Middle Eastern countries\nexperience significant unemployment, as well\nas widespread underemployment. There has also\nbeen a recent increase in recruitment efforts\nand an aggressive push for territorial control\nby terrorist groups in the region, which has\nled to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities.\nWarfare in Syria has spread to surrounding\nareas, including many portions of Iraq and\nTurkey. Such hostilities may continue into the\nfuture or may escalate at any time due to\nethnic, racial, political, religious or\nideological tensions between groups in the\nregion or foreign intervention or lack of\nintervention, among other factors. Risk of\nInvesting in North America. A decrease in\nimports or exports, changes in trade\nregulations or an economic recession in any\nNorth American country can have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire North American\nregion and on some or all of the North\nAmerican countries in which the Fund invests.\nThe U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest\ntrading and investment partner. The Canadian\nand Mexican economies are significantly\naffected by developments in the U.S. economy.\nSince the implementation of the North American\nFree Trade Agreement ( \u201c NAFTA \u201d ) in 1994\namong Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total\nmerchandise trade among the three countries\nhas increased. However, political developments\nincluding the implementation of tariffs by the\nU.S., and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the\nform of the United States-Mexico-Canada\nAgreement ( \u201c USMCA \u201d ), which replaced NAFTA\non July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North\nAmerica\u2019s economic outlook and, as a result,\nthe value of securities held by the Fund.\nPolicy and legislative changes in one country\nmay have a significant effect on North\nAmerican markets generally, as well as on the\nvalue of certain securities held by the Fund.\nRisk of Investing in Saudi Arabia. The Fund\u2019s\nUnderlying Index includes Saudi Arabian equity\nsecurities. The ability of foreign investors\n(such as the Fund) to invest in the securities\nof Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new.\nSuch ability could be restricted by the Saudi\nArabian government at any time, and unforeseen\nrisks could materialize with respect to\nforeign ownership in such securities. In\naddition, the Capital Market Authority ( \u201c CMA\n\u201d ) places investment limitations on the\nownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian\nissuers by foreign investors, including a\nlimitation on the Fund\u2019s ownership of the\nsecurities of any single issuer listed on the\nSaudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may\nprevent the Fund from investing in accordance\nwith its strategy and contribute to tracking\nerror against the Underlying Index. These\nrestrictions may be changed or new\nrestrictions, such as licensing requirements,\nspecial approvals or additional foreign taxes,\nmay be instituted\n\n22\n\nat any time. The Fund may not be able to\nobtain or maintain any such licenses or\napprovals and may not be able to buy and sell\nsecurities at full value. Major disruptions or\nregulatory changes could occur in the Saudi\nArabian market, any of which could negatively\nimpact the Fund. These risks may be\nexacerbated, compared to more developed\nmarkets, given the limited history of foreign\ninvestment in the Saudi Arabian market.\nInvestments in Saudi Arabia may also be\nsubject to loss due to expropriation or\nnationalization of assets and property or the\nimposition of restrictions on additional\nforeign investments and repatriation of\ncapital. Such heightened risks may include,\namong others, restrictions on and government\nintervention in international trade,\nconfiscatory taxation, political instability,\nincluding authoritarian and/or military\ninvolvement in governmental decision making,\narmed conflict, crime and instability as a\nresult of religious, ethnic and/or\nsocioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has\nprivatized, or has begun the process of\nprivatizing, certain entities and industries.\nNewly privatized companies may face strong\ncompetition from government-sponsored\ncompetitors that have not been privatized. In\nsome instances, investors in newly privatized\nentities have suffered losses due to the\ninability of the newly privatized entities to\nadjust quickly to a competitive environment or\nchanging regulatory and legal standards or, in\nsome cases, due to re-nationalization of such\nprivatized entities. There is no assurance\nthat similar losses will not recur. Further,\nunder income tax laws imposed by the General\nAuthority of Zakat and Tax, dividends paid by\na Saudi Arabian company to foreign\nstockholders are generally subject to a 5%\nwithholding tax (different tax rates may apply\npursuant to an applicable treaty). Saudi\nArabia is highly reliant on income from the\nsale of petroleum and trade with other\ncountries involved in the sale of petroleum,\nand its economy is therefore vulnerable to\nchanges in foreign currency values and the\nmarket for petroleum, as well as acts\ntargeting petroleum production or processing\nfacilities in Saudi Arabia. As global demand\nfor petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be\nsignificantly impacted. In the recent past,\nthe Saudi Arabian government has explored\nprivatization and diversification of the\neconomy in the wake of a diminished petroleum\nmarket. Like most Middle Eastern governments,\nthe government of Saudi Arabia exercises\nsubstantial influence over many aspects of the\nprivate sector. Although liberalization in the\nwider economy is underway, in many areas it\nhas lagged significantly: restrictions on\nforeign ownership persist, and the government\nhas an ownership stake in many key industries.\nThe situation is exacerbated by the fact that\nSaudi Arabia is governed by an absolute\nmonarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced strained relations with economic\npartners worldwide, including other countries\nin the Middle East, due to geopolitical\nevents. Incidents involving a Middle Eastern\ncountry\u2019s or the region\u2019s security, including\nterrorism, may cause uncertainty in their\nmarkets and may adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. Governmental\nactions in the future could have a significant\neffect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia,\nwhich could affect private sector companies\nand the Fund, as well as the value of\nsecurities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio. Any\neconomic sanctions on Saudi Arabian\nindividuals or Saudi Arabian corporate\nentities, or even the threat of sanctions, may\nresult in the decline of the value and\nliquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a\nweakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse\nconsequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. Any\nsanctions could also result in the immediate\nfreeze of Saudi Arabian securities and/or\nfunds investing in prohibited assets,\nimpairing the ability of the Fund to buy,\nsell, receive or deliver those securities\nand/or assets. In addition, Saudi Arabia\u2019s\neconomy relies heavily on cheap, foreign\nlabor, and changes in the availability of this\nlabor supply could have an adverse effect on\nthe economy. The securities markets in Saudi\nArabia may not be as developed as those in\nother countries. As a result, securities\nmarkets in Saudi Arabia are subject to greater\nrisks associated with market volatility, lower\nmarket capitalization, lower trading volume,\nilliquidity, inflation, greater price\nfluctuations, uncertainty regarding the\nexistence of trading markets, governmental\ncontrol and heavy regulation of labor and\nindustry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian\ncompanies tend to trade less frequently than\nthose of companies on exchanges in more\ndeveloped markets. Such infrequent trading may\nadversely affect the pricing of these\nsecurities and the Fund\u2019s ability to sell\nthese securities in the future. Although the\npolitical situation in Saudi Arabia is largely\nstable, Saudi Arabia has historically\nexperienced political instability, and there\nremains the possibility that the stability\nwill not hold in the future or that\ninstability in the larger Middle East region\ncould adversely impact the economy of Saudi\nArabia. Instability may be caused by military\ndevelopments, government interventions in the\nmarketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes,\nattempted social or political reforms,\nreligious differences, or other factors.\nAdditionally, anti-Western views held by\ncertain groups in the Middle East may\ninfluence government policies regarding\nforeign investment. Further developments in\nU.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other\nMiddle-Eastern countries may affect these\nattitudes and policies. The U.S. is a\nsignificant trading partner of, or foreign\ninvestor in, Saudi Arabia. As a result,\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be\nparticularly affected by changes in the U.S.\neconomy. A decrease in U.S. imports or\nexports, new trade and financial regulations\nor tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar\nexchange rate or an economic slowdown in the\nU.S. may have a material adverse effect on the\neconomic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a\nresult, securities to which the Fund has\nexposure. Political instability in North\nAfrica and the larger Middle East region has\ncaused\n\n23\n\nsignificant disruptions to many industries.\nContinued political and social unrest in these\nareas may negatively affect the value of\nsecurities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio. Certain\nissuers located in Saudi Arabia may operate\nin, or have dealings with, countries subject\nto sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the\nU.S. government and the United Nations and/or\ncountries identified by the U.S. government as\nstate sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an\nissuer may sustain damage to its reputation if\nit is identified as an issuer which operates\nin, or has dealings with, such countries. The\nFund, as an investor in such issuers, will be\nindirectly subject to those risks. Risk of\nInvesting in the Communication Services\nSector. The communication services sector\nconsists of both companies in the\ntelecommunication services industry as well as\nthose in the media and entertainment industry.\nExamples of companies in the telecommunication\nservices industry group include providers of\nfiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless\ntelecommunications networks. Companies in the\nmedia and entertainment industry group\nencompass a variety of services and products\nincluding television broadcasting, gaming\nproducts, social media, networking platforms,\nonline classifieds, online review websites,\nand Internet search engines. Companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be affected\nby industry competition, substantial capital\nrequirements, government regulation, and\nobsolescence of communications products and\nservices due to technological advancement.\nFluctuating domestic and international demand,\nshifting demographics and often unpredictable\nchanges in consumer tastes can drastically\naffect a communication services company's\nprofitability. In addition, while all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nThe communication services sector of a\ncountry\u2019s economy is often subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals, or the enactment of new\nregulatory requirements may negatively affect\nthe business of communications companies.\nGovernment actions around the world,\nspecifically in the area of pre-marketing\nclearance of products and prices, can be\narbitrary and unpredictable. The\ncommunications services industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition\nfor market share, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility and\nstandardization, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, research and development\nof new products, lack of standardization or\ncompatibility with existing technologies, and\na dependency on patent and copyright\nprotections. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may encounter distressed cash\nflows due to the need to commit substantial\ncapital to meet increasing competition,\nparticularly in developing new products and\nservices using new technology. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof certain communications companies obsolete.\nTelecommunications providers with exposure to\nthe U.S. are generally required to obtain\nfranchises or licenses in order to provide\nservices in a given location. Licensing and\nfranchise rights in the telecommunications\nsector are limited, which may provide an\nadvantage to certain participants. Limited\navailability of such rights, high barriers to\nmarket entry and regulatory oversight, among\nother factors, have led to consolidation of\ncompanies within the sector, which could lead\nto further regulation or other negative\neffects in the future. Telecommunication\nproviders investing in non-U.S. countries may\nbe subject to similar risks. Additional risks\ninclude those related to competitive\nchallenges in the U.S. from non-U.S.\ncompetitors engaged in strategic joint\nventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S.\nmarkets from both U.S. and non-U.S.\ncompetitors. Companies in the media and\nentertainment industries can be significantly\naffected by several factors, including\ncompetition, particularly in formulation of\nproducts and services using new technologies,\ncyclicality of revenues and earnings, a\npotential decrease in the discretionary income\nof targeted individuals, changing consumer\ntastes and interests, and the potential\nincrease in government regulation. Companies\nin the media and entertainment industries may\nbecome obsolete quickly. Advertising spending\ncan be an important revenue source for media\nand entertainment companies. During economic\ndownturns advertising spending typically\ndecreases and, as a result, media and\nentertainment companies tend to generate less\nrevenue. Risk of Investing in the Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector. Companies engaged in the\ndesign, production or distribution of products\nor services for the consumer discretionary\nsector (including, without limitation,\ntelevision and radio broadcasting,\nmanufacturing, publishing, recording and\nmusical instruments, motion pictures,\nphotography, amusement and theme parks, gaming\ncasinos, sporting goods and sports arenas,\ncamping and recreational equipment, toys and\ngames, apparel, travel-related services,\nautomobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food\nand other restaurants) are subject to the risk\nthat their products or services may become\nobsolete quickly. The success of these\ncompanies can depend heavily on disposable\n\n24\n\nhousehold income and consumer spending. During\nperiods of an expanding economy, the consumer\ndiscretionary sector may outperform the\nconsumer staples sector, but may underperform\nwhen economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the\nconsumer discretionary sector can be\nsignificantly affected by several factors,\nincluding, without limitation, the performance\nof domestic and international economies,\nexchange rates, changing consumer preferences,\ndemographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical\nrevenue generation, consumer confidence,\ncommodity price volatility, labor relations,\ninterest rates, import and export controls,\nintense competition, technological\ndevelopments and government regulation. Risk\nof Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector.\nCompanies in the consumer staples sector may\nbe adversely affected by changes in the global\neconomy, consumer spending, competition,\ndemographics and consumer preferences, and\nproduction spending. Companies in the consumer\nstaples sector may also be affected by changes\nin global economic, environmental and\npolitical events, economic conditions, the\ndepletion of resources, and government\nregulation. For instance, government\nregulations may affect the permissibility of\nusing various food additives and production\nmethods of companies that make food products,\nwhich could affect company profitability.\nCompanies in the consumer staples sector also\nmay be subject to risks pertaining to the\nsupply of, demand for and prices of raw\nmaterials. The prices of raw materials\nfluctuate in response to a number of factors,\nincluding, without limitation, changes in\ngovernment agricultural support programs,\nexchange rates, import and export controls,\nchanges in international agricultural and\ntrading policies, and seasonal and weather\nconditions. Companies in the consumer staples\nsector may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may also have an adverse impact on their\nprofitability. Risk of Investing in the\nFinancials Sector. Companies in the financials\nsector include small, regional and money\ncenter banks, securities brokerage firms,\nasset management companies, savings banks and\nthrift institutions, specialty finance\ncompanies ( e.g. , credit card, mortgage\nproviders), insurance and insurance brokerage\nfirms, consumer finance firms, financial\nconglomerates and foreign banking and\nfinancial companies. Most financial companies\nare subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which limits their activities and\nmay affect their ability to earn a profit from\na given line of business. Government\nregulation may change frequently and may have\nsignificant adverse consequences for companies\nin the financials sector, including effects\nnot intended by the regulation. Direct\ngovernmental intervention in the operations of\nfinancial companies and financial markets may\nmaterially and adversely affect the companies\nin which the Fund invests, including\nlegislation in many countries that may\nincrease government regulation, repatriation\nand other intervention. The impact of\ngovernmental intervention and legislative\nchanges on any individual financial company or\non the financials sector as a whole cannot be\npredicted. The valuation of financial\ncompanies has been and continues to be subject\nto unprecedented volatility and may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors, including\ninterest rate risk and sovereign debt default.\nCertain financial businesses are subject to\nintense competitive pressures, including\nmarket share and price competition. Financial\ncompanies in foreign countries are subject to\nmarket-specific and general regulatory and\ninterest rate concerns. In particular,\ngovernment regulation in certain foreign\ncountries may include taxes and controls on\ninterest rates, credit availability, minimum\ncapital requirements, bans on short sales,\nlimits on prices and restrictions on currency\ntransfers. In addition, companies in the\nfinancials sector may be the targets of\nhacking and potential theft of proprietary or\ncustomer information or disruptions in\nservice, which could have a material adverse\neffect on their businesses. The profitability\nof banks, savings and loan associations and\nother financial companies is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change; for instance, when interest\nrates go up, the value of securities issued by\nmany types of companies in the financials\nsector generally goes down. In other words,\nfinancial companies may be adversely affected\nin certain market cycles, including, without\nlimitation, during periods of rising interest\nrates, which may restrict the availability and\nincrease the cost of capital, and during\nperiods of declining economic conditions,\nwhich may cause, among other things, credit\nlosses due to financial difficulties of\nborrowers. In addition, general economic\nconditions are important to the operations of\nthese companies, and financial difficulties of\nborrowers may have an adverse effect on the\nprofitability of financial companies.\nCompanies in the financials sector are exposed\ndirectly to the credit risk of their borrowers\nand counterparties, who may be leveraged to an\nunknown degree, including through swaps and\nother derivatives products, and who at times\nmay be unable to meet their obligations to the\nfinancial services companies. Financial\nservices companies may have significant\nexposure to the same borrowers and\ncounterparties, with the result that a\nborrower\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to meet\nits obligations to one company may affect\nother companies with exposure to the same\nborrower or counterparty. This\ninterconnectedness of risk, including cross-\ndefault risk, may result in significant\nnegative impacts to the financial condition\nand reputation of companies with direct\nexposure to the defaulting counterparty as\nwell as adverse cascading effects in the\nmarkets and the financials sector\n\n25\n\ngenerally. Financial companies can be highly\ndependent upon access to capital markets, and\nany impediments to such access, such as\nadverse overall economic conditions or a\nnegative perception in the capital markets of\na financial company\u2019s financial condition or\nprospects, could adversely affect its\nbusiness. Deterioration of credit markets can\nhave an adverse impact on a broad range of\nfinancial markets, causing certain financial\ncompanies to incur large losses. In these\nconditions, companies in the financials sector\nmay experience significant declines in the\nvaluation of their assets, take actions to\nraise capital and even cease operations. Some\nfinancial companies may also be required to\naccept or borrow significant amounts of\ncapital from government sources and may face\nfuture government-imposed restrictions on\ntheir businesses or increased government\nintervention. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that governments will provide any\nsuch relief in the future. These actions may\ncause the securities of many companies in the\nfinancials sector to decline in value. Risk of\nInvesting in the Healthcare Sector. Companies\nin the healthcare sector are often issuers\nwhose profitability may be affected by\nextensive government regulation, restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses, rising or falling costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure, an\nincreased emphasis on outpatient services, a\nlimited number of products, industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies and other\nmarket developments. Many healthcare companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe actual or perceived safety and efficiency\nof their products. Patents have a limited\nduration, and, upon expiration, other\ncompanies may market substantially similar \u201c\ngeneric \u201d products that are typically sold at\na lower price than the patented product, which\ncan cause the original developer of the\nproduct to lose market share and/or reduce the\nprice charged for the product, resulting in\nlower profits for the original developer. As a\nresult, the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. In addition, because the products\nand services of many companies in the\nhealthcare sector affect the health and well-\nbeing of many individuals, these companies are\nespecially susceptible to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and similar claims.\nHealthcare companies are subject to\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Many new products in the\nhealthcare sector may be subject to regulatory\napprovals. The process of obtaining such\napprovals may be long and costly, which can\nresult in increased development costs, delayed\ncost recovery and loss of competitive\nadvantage to the extent that rival companies\nhave developed competing products or\nprocedures, adversely affecting the company\u2019s\nrevenues and profitability. In other words,\ndelays in the regulatory approval process may\ndiminish the opportunity for a company to\nprofit from a new product or to bring a new\nproduct to market, which could have a material\nadverse effect on a company\u2019s business.\nHealthcare companies may also be strongly\naffected by scientific biotechnology or\ntechnological developments, and their products\nmay quickly become obsolete. Also, many\nhealthcare companies offer products and\nservices that are subject to governmental\nregulation and may be adversely affected by\nchanges in governmental policies or laws.\nChanges in governmental policies or laws may\nspan a wide range of topics, including cost\ncontrol, national health insurance, incentives\nfor compensation in the provision of\nhealthcare services, tax incentives and\npenalties related to healthcare insurance\npremiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare\nplans. In addition, a number of legislative\nproposals concerning healthcare have been\nconsidered by the U.S. Congress in recent\nyears. It is unclear what proposals will\nultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect\nthey may have on companies in the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, the expansion of\nfacilities by healthcare-related providers may\nbe subject to \u201c determinations of need \u201d by\ncertain government authorities. This process\nnot only generally increases the time and\ncosts involved in these expansions, but also\nmakes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the\nrevenue and profitability growth potential of\nhealthcare-related facilities operators and\nnegatively affecting the prices of their\nsecurities. Moreover, in recent years, both\nlocal and national governmental budgets have\ncome under pressure to reduce spending and\ncontrol healthcare costs, which could both\nadversely affect regulatory processes and\npublic funding available for healthcare\nproducts, services and facilities. Risk of\nInvesting in the Industrials Sector. The value\nof securities issued by companies in the\nindustrials sector may be adversely affected\nby supply of and demand for both their\nspecific products or services and for\nindustrials sector products in general. The\nproducts of manufacturing companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological\ndevelopments and frequent new product\nintroduction. Government regulations, trade\ndisputes, world events and economic conditions\nmay affect the performance of companies in the\nindustrials sector. The industrials sector may\nalso be adversely affected by changes or\ntrends in commodity prices, which may be\ninfluenced by unpredictable factors. For\nexample, commodity price declines and unit\nvolume reductions resulting from an over-\nsupply of materials used in the industrials\nsector can adversely affect the sector.\nFurthermore, companies in the industrials\nsector may be subject to liability for\nenvironmental damage, product liability\nclaims, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\n\n26\n\nRisk of Investing in the Materials Sector.\nCompanies in the materials sector may be\nadversely affected by commodity price\nvolatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social\nand political unrest, war, import or export\ncontrols, increased competition, depletion of\nresources, technical progress, labor relations\nand government regulations, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control,\namong other factors. Such risks may adversely\naffect the issuers to which the Fund has\nexposure. Companies in the materials sector\nare also at risk of liability for\nenvironmental damage and product liability\nclaims. Production of materials may exceed\ndemand as a result of market imbalances or\neconomic downturns, leading to poor investment\nreturns. These risks are heightened for\ncompanies in the materials sector located in\nforeign markets. Risk of Investing in\nTechnology Companies. Technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological\nadvances may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources and personnel.\nThese companies may face rapid product\nobsolescence as well as unexpected risks and\ncosts related to new product introduction and\ntechnological developments, such as artificial\nintelligence and machine learning. Technology\ncompanies may be adversely affected by\ndisruptions to supply chains and distribution\nnetworks as well as issues at third-party\npartners. They are heavily dependent on patent\nand other intellectual property rights, and\nthe loss or impairment of these rights may\nadversely affect their profitability.\nTechnology companies may face increased\ngovernment scrutiny and may be subject to\nadverse government or legal action. These\ncompanies also may be adversely affected by,\namong other things, actual or perceived\nsecurity vulnerabilities or other defects in\ntheir products and services, which may result\nin lawsuits, government enforcement actions\nand other remediation costs. Proxy Voting\nPolicy For the Fund, the Board has delegated\nthe voting of proxies for the Fund\u2019s\nsecurities to BFA pursuant to the Fund's Proxy\nVoting Policy, and BFA has adopted policies\nand procedures (collectively, the \u201c iShares\nETFs Proxy Voting Policies \u201d ) governing proxy\nvoting by accounts managed by BFA, including\nthe Fund. Under the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting\nPolicies, BFA will vote proxies related to\nFund securities in the best interests of the\nFund and its shareholders. From time to time,\na vote may present a conflict between the\ninterests of the Fund\u2019s shareholders, on the\none hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated\nperson of the Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA\nmaintains policies and procedures that are\ndesigned to prevent undue influence on BFA\u2019s\nproxy voting activity that might stem from any\nrelationship between the issuer of a proxy (or\nany dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA\u2019s\naffiliates, the Fund or the Fund\u2019s affiliates.\nMost conflicts are managed through a\nstructural separation of BFA\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Group from BFA\u2019s employees with\nsales and client responsibilities. In\naddition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure\nthat all engagements with corporate issuers or\ndissident shareholders are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BFA\u2019s\nrelationship with the issuer of the proxy or\nthe dissident shareholder. In certain\ninstances, BFA may determine to engage an\nindependent fiduciary to vote proxies as a\nfurther safeguard to avoid potential conflicts\nof interest or as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Copies of the iShares ETFs\nProxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix\nA. Information with respect to how proxies\nrelating to the Fund's portfolio securities\nwere voted during the 12-month period ending\nJune 30 will be available: (i) without charge,\nupon request, by calling 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or through the Fund's website\nat www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC\u2019s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation On each Business Day (as defined\nin the Creation and Redemption of Creation\nUnits section of this SAI), prior to the\nopening of regular trading on the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing exchange, the Fund discloses\non its website ( www.iShares.com ) certain\ninformation relating to the portfolio holdings\nthat will form the basis of the Fund\u2019s next\nnet asset value per share calculation. In\naddition, certain information may also be made\navailable to certain parties: \u2022 Communications\nof Data Files: The Fund may make available\nthrough the facilities of the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d )\nor through posting on the www.iShares.com ,\nprior to the opening of trading on each\nbusiness day, a list of the Fund\u2019s holdings\n(generally pro-rata) that Authorized\nParticipants could deliver to the Fund to\nsettle purchases of the Fund ( i.e. Deposit\nSecurities) or that Authorized Participants\nwould receive from the Fund to settle\nredemptions of the Fund ( i.e. Fund\nSecurities). These files are known as the\nPortfolio Composition File and the Fund\n\n27\n\nData File (collectively, \u201c Files \u201d ). The\nFiles are applicable for the next trading day\nand are provided to the NSCC and/or posted on\nwww.iShares.com after the close of markets in\nthe U.S. \u2022 Communications with Authorized\nParticipants and Liquidity Providers: Certain\nemployees of BFA are responsible for\ninteracting with Authorized Participants and\nliquidity providers with respect to discussing\ncustom basket proposals as described in the\nCustom Baskets section of this SAI. As part of\nthese discussions, these employees may discuss\nwith an Authorized Participant or liquidity\nprovider the securities the Fund is willing to\naccept for a creation, and securities that the\nFund will provide on a redemption. BFA\nemployees may also discuss portfolio holdings-\nrelated information with broker/dealers, in\nconnection with settling the Fund\u2019s\ntransactions, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with the disclosure in the Fund\u2019s\ncurrent registration statement. \u2022\nCommunications with Listing Exchanges: From\ntime to time, employees of BFA may discuss\nportfolio holdings information with the\napplicable primary listing exchange for the\nFund as needed to meet the exchange listing\nstandards. \u2022 Communications with Other\nPortfolio Managers: Certain information may be\nprovided to employees of BFA who manage funds\nthat invest a significant percentage of their\nassets in shares of an underlying fund as\nnecessary to manage the fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and strategy. \u2022 Communication of\nOther Information: Certain explanatory\ninformation regarding the Files is released to\nAuthorized Participants and liquidity\nproviders on a daily basis, but is only done\nso after the Files are posted to\nwww.iShares.com . \u2022 Third-Party Service\nProviders: Certain portfolio holdings\ninformation may be disclosed to Fund Trustees\nand their counsel, outside counsel for the\nFund, auditors and to certain third-party\nservice providers ( i.e. , fund administrator,\ncustodian, proxy voting service) for which a\nnon-disclosure, confidentiality agreement or\nother obligation is in place with such service\nproviders, as may be necessary to conduct\nbusiness in the ordinary course in a manner\nconsistent with applicable policies,\nagreements with the Fund, the terms of the\ncurrent registration statements and federal\nsecurities laws and regulations thereunder. \u2022\nLiquidity Metrics: \u201c Liquidity Metrics, \u201d\nwhich seek to ascertain the Fund\u2019s liquidity\nprofile under BlackRock\u2019s global liquidity\nrisk methodology, include but are not limited\nto: (a) disclosure regarding the number of\ndays needed to liquidate a portfolio or the\nportfolio\u2019s underlying investments; and (b)\nthe percentage of the Fund\u2019s NAV invested in a\nparticular liquidity tier under BlackRock\u2019s\nglobal liquidity risk methodology. The\ndissemination of position-level liquidity\nmetrics data and any non-public regulatory\ndata pursuant to the Liquidity Rule (including\nSEC liquidity tiering) is not permitted unless\npre-approved. Disclosure of portfolio-level\nliquidity metrics prior to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires a non-\ndisclosure or confidentiality agreement and\napproval of the Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance\nOfficer. Portfolio-level liquidity metrics\ndisclosure subsequent to 60 calendar days\nafter calendar quarter-end requires the\napproval of portfolio management and must be\ndisclosed to all parties requesting the\ninformation if disclosed to any party. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer or his\ndelegate may authorize disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information pursuant to the above\npolicy and procedures, subject to restrictions\non selective disclosure imposed by applicable\nlaw. The Board reviews the policy and\nprocedures for disclosure of portfolio\nholdings information at least annually.\nConstruction and Maintenance of the Underlying\nIndex A description of the Underlying Index is\nprovided below. With respect to certain\nunderlying indexes of the iShares funds, BFA\nor its affiliates have held discussions with\nthe applicable index provider regarding their\nbusiness interest in licensing an index to\ntrack a particular market segment and conveyed\ninvestment concepts and strategies that could\nbe considered for the index. The index\nprovider designed and constituted such indices\nusing concepts conveyed by BFA or its\naffiliates. For certain of these indices, the\nrelevant fund may be the first or sole user of\nthe underlying index. In its sole discretion,\nthe index provider determines the composition\nof the securities and other instruments in\nsuch underlying index, the rebalance protocols\nof the underlying index, the weightings of the\nsecurities and other instruments in the\nunderlying index, and any updates to the\nmethodology. From time to time, BFA or its\naffiliates may\n\n28\n\nalso provide input relating to possible\nmethodology changes of such underlying index\npursuant to the index provider\u2019s consultation\nprocess or pursuant to other communications\nwith the index provider. The MSCI Indexes The\nMSCI indexes were founded in 1969 by Capital\nInternational S.A. as international\nperformance benchmarks constructed to\nfacilitate comparison of world markets. The\nMSCI single country standard equity indexes\nhave covered the world's developed markets\nsince 1969 and in 1987 MSCI commenced coverage\nof emerging markets. Local stock exchanges\ntraditionally calculated their own indexes,\nwhich were generally not comparable with one\nanother due to differences in the\nrepresentation of the local market,\nmathematical formulas, base dates and methods\nof adjusting for capital changes. MSCI,\nhowever, applies the same calculation\nmethodology to all markets for all single\ncountry standard equity indexes, both\ndeveloped and emerging. MSCI Global Investable\nMarket Indexes MSCI's Global Investable Market\nIndexes (the \u201c MSCI GIMI \u201d ) provide coverage\nand non-overlapping market segmentation by\nmarket capitalization size and by style. The\nMSCI GIMI intend to target approximately 99%\ncoverage of the free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization in each market of large-, mid-\nand small-cap securities. In each market, MSCI\ncreates an Investable Market Index, Standard\nIndex, Large Cap Index, Mid Cap Index and\nSmall Cap Index. The Standard Index, Large Cap\nIndex, Mid Cap Index and Small Cap Index are\neach subsets of the Investable Market Index\nfor a market. The MSCI Global Standard Index\nis the aggregation of the Large Cap Index and\nMid Cap Index and the MSCI GIMI is the\naggregation of the MSCI Global Standard Index\nand MSCI Global Small Cap Index. Selection\nCriteria. MSCI's index construction process\ninvolves: (i) defining the equity universe;\n(ii) determining the market investable equity\nuniverse for each market; (iii) determining\nmarket capitalization size segments for each\nmarket; (iv) applying final size segment\ninvestability requirements; and (v) applying\nindex continuity rules for the MSCI Global\nStandard Index. Defining the Equity Universe .\nMSCI begins with securities listed in\ncountries in the MSCI GIMI. As of August 2024,\n23 are classified as developed markets, 24 as\nemerging markets, and 27 as frontier markets.\nAll listed equity securities and listed\nsecurities that exhibit characteristics of\nequity securities, except mutual funds, ETFs,\nequity derivatives, limited partnerships and\nmost investment trusts, are eligible for\ninclusion in the equity universe. REITs in\nsome countries and certain income trusts in\nCanada are also eligible for inclusion. Each\ncompany and its securities ( i.e ., share\nclasses) are classified in only one country.\nDetermining the Market Investable Equity\nUniverse for Each Market. The equity universe\nin any market is derived by applying\ninvestability screens to individual companies\nand securities in that market. Some\ninvestability requirements are applied at the\nindividual security level and some at the\noverall company level, represented by the\naggregation of individual securities of the\ncompany. As a result, the inclusion or\nexclusion of one security does not imply the\nautomatic inclusion or exclusion of other\nsecurities of the same company. Determining\nMarket Capitalization Size Segments for Each\nMarket. In order to create size components\nthat can be meaningfully aggregated into\ncomposites, individual market size segments\nbalance the following two objectives: \u2022\nAchieving global size integrity by ensuring\nthat companies of comparable and relevant\nsizes are included in a given size segment\nacross all markets in a composite index; and \u2022\nAchieving consistent market coverage by\nensuring that each market's size segment is\nrepresented in its proportional weight in the\ncomposite universe. The Standard Indexes,\nLarge Cap Indexes, Mid Cap Indexes, and Small\nCap Indexes capture the following market\ncapitalization size segments: \u2022 MSCI Global\nStandard Indexes cover all investable large-\nand mid-cap securities by including the\nlargest issuers comprising approximately 85%\nof each market\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. \u2022 MSCI Global Large Cap\nIndexes provide coverage of all investable\nlarge-cap securities by including the largest\nissuers comprising approximately 70% of each\nmarket\u2019s free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization.\n\n29\n\n\u2022 MSCI Global Mid Cap Indexes provide coverage\nin each market by deriving the difference\nbetween the market coverage of the MSCI Global\nStandard Index and the MSCI Global Large Cap\nIndex in that market. \u2022 MSCI Global Small Cap\nIndexes provide coverage of companies with a\nmarket capitalization below that of the\ncompanies in the MSCI Global Standard Indexes.\nApplying Final Size Segment Investability\nRequirements. In order to enhance\nreplicability of the indexes, additional size\nsegment investability requirements are set for\nthe MSCI GIMI and MSCI Global Standard Index.\nThese investability requirements include\nminimum free float-adjusted market\ncapitalization, minimum liquidity, minimum\nforeign limits and minimum length of trading.\nApplying Index Continuity Rules for the\nStandard Index. In order to achieve index\ncontinuity as well as provide some basic level\nof diversification within a market index,\nnotwithstanding the effect of other index\nconstruction rules contained herein, a minimum\nnumber of five constituents will be maintained\nfor a developed market Standard Index and a\nminimum number of three constituents will be\nmaintained for an emerging market Standard\nIndex. Weighting. All indexes of the MSCI GIMI\nare free float weighted, i.e., companies are\nincluded in the indexes at the value of their\nfree public float (free float multiplied by\nsecurity price). Regional Weights. Market\ncapitalization-weighting, combined with a\nconsistent target of approximately 99% of free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization, helps\nensure that each country's weight in regional\nand international indexes approximates its\nweight in the total universe of developing and\nemerging markets. A market is equivalent to a\nsingle country except for developed Europe,\nwhere all markets are aggregated into a single\nmarket for index construction purposes.\nIndividual country indexes of the European\ndeveloped markets are derived from the\nconstituents of the MSCI GIMI Europe Index.\nFree Float. MSCI defines the free float of a\nsecurity as the proportion of shares\noutstanding that are deemed to be available\nfor purchase in the public equity markets by\ninternational investors. In practice,\nlimitations on free float available to\ninternational investors include: (i) strategic\nand other shareholdings not considered part of\navailable free float; and (ii) limits on share\nownership for foreigners. MSCI calculates the\nfree float-adjusted market capitalization of\neach security in the equity index universe by\n(i) defining and estimating the free float\navailable to foreign investors; (ii) assigning\na free float-adjustment factor to each\nsecurity; and (iii) calculating the free\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of each\nsecurity. Under MSCI's free float-adjustment\nmethodology, a constituent's inclusion factor\nis equal to its estimated free float, rounded\nup to the closest 5% for constituents with\nfree float equal to or exceeding 15%. For\nexample, a constituent security with a free\nfloat of 23.2% will be included in the index\nat 25% of its market capitalization. For\nsecurities with a free float of less than 15%,\nthe estimated free float is adjusted to the\nnearest 1%. Price and Exchange Rates Prices.\nThe prices used to calculate all MSCI indexes\nare the official exchange closing prices or\nthose figures accepted as such. MSCI reserves\nthe right to use an alternative pricing source\non any given day. Exchange Rates. MSCI uses\nthe World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates\ntaken at 4:00 p.m. London time. In case World\nMarkets/Reuters does not provide rates for\nspecific markets on given days (for example,\nChristmas Day and New Year's Day), the\nprevious business day's rates are normally\nused. MSCI independently monitors the exchange\nrates on all its indexes. MSCI may under\nexceptional circumstances elect to use\nalternative sources of exchange rates if the\nWorld Markets/Reuters rates are not available,\nor if MSCI determines that the World\nMarkets/Reuters rates are not reflective of\nmarket circumstances for a given currency on a\nparticular day. In such circumstances, an\nannouncement would be sent to clients with the\nrelated information. If appropriate, MSCI may\nconduct a consultation with the investment\ncommunity to gather feedback on the most\nrelevant exchange rate. Changes to the\nIndexes. The MSCI GIMI are maintained with the\nobjective of reflecting, on a timely basis,\nthe evolution of the underlying equity\nmarkets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes,\nemphasis is also placed on continuity,\nreplicability and minimizing turnover in the\nindexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves\nmany aspects, including: (i) additions to, and\ndeletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in\nnumber of shares; and (iii) changes in\ninclusion factors as a result of updated free\nfloat estimates.\n\n30\n\nIndex maintenance can be described by three\nbroad categories of changes: \u2022 Semi-Annual\nIndex Reviews ( \u201c SAIRs \u201d ), conducted on a\nfixed semi-annual timetable that\nsystematically reassess the various dimensions\nof the equity universe for all markets; \u2022\nQuarterly Index Reviews ( \u201c QIRs \u201d ), aimed at\npromptly reflecting other significant market\nevents; and \u2022 Ongoing event-related changes,\nsuch as mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs,\nbankruptcies, reorganizations and other\nsimilar corporate events, which generally are\nimplemented in the indexes as they occur.\nPotential changes in the status of countries\n(stand-alone, frontier, emerging and\ndeveloped) follow their own implementation\ntime tables. In addition, reviews of company\ninvolvement in ESG controversies, when\napplicable, may differ by index and severity\nof the ESG controversy as determined by MSCI.\nMSCI conducts SAIRs generally as of the close\nof the last business day of May and November.\nDuring the SAIRs, MSCI updates the investable\nequity universe and reassesses size\nsegmentation investability requirements. MSCI\nalso conducts QIRs generally as of the close\nof the last business day of February and\nAugust. During the QIRs, MSCI reflects changes\nin the index that were not captured at the\ntime of their actual occurrence, but are\nsignificant enough to be included before the\nnext SAIR. The results of the SAIR and QIR are\ngenerally announced at least ten business days\nin advance of implementation. Creation of\nSector and Industry Indexes using the Global\nIndustry Classification Standard (GICS \u00ae ) All\nsecurities in the Global Investable Equity\nUniverse are assigned to the industry that\nbest describes their business activities using\nthe GICS. The GICS consists of sectors,\nindustry groups, industries and sub-\nindustries. Under the GICS, each company is\nassigned to one unique sub-industry according\nto its principal business activity (generally\ndefined as the business activity that\ngenerates 60% or more of the company\u2019s\nrevenues). Narrower indexes may be derived\nbased on industry classification, and may\ncontain securities belonging to specific\nsectors, industry groups, industries, sub-\nindustries or a combination thereof. MSCI ACWI\nQuality Index Number of Components:\napproximately 483 Index Description. The MSCI\nACWI Quality Index is categorized by MSCI as a\nfactor Index. Factor indexes are designed to\nreflect the systematic elements of particular\ninvestment styles or strategies. The quality\nfactor is complementary to other systematic\nfactors such as size, value and low\nvolatility. The Underlying Index is based on a\ntraditional market capitalization-weighted\nparent index, the MSCI ACWI Index, which\nincludes large- and mid-capitalization equity\nsecurities in developed and emerging market\ncountries. MSCI quality indexes aim to reflect\nthe performance of a quality growth strategy.\nThe Underlying Index seeks to capture the\nperformance of quality growth stocks by\nidentifying stocks with high quality scores\nwhile maintaining reasonably high trading\nliquidity, investment capacity and moderate\nindex turnover. Companies that tend to have\nhigh return on equity, stable earnings that\nare uncorrelated with the broad business cycle\nand strong balance sheets with low financial\nleverage are targeted for quality growth.\nIndex Methodology. The Underlying Index holds\na fixed number of securities that are chosen\nfrom constituents within the parent index. The\nUnderlying Index aims to capture the\nperformance of quality growth stocks by\nidentifying stocks with high quality scores\nbased on three variables: high return on\nequity ( i.e. , the trailing 12-month earnings\nper share divided by the latest book value per\nshare); earnings variability ( i.e. , the\nstandard deviation of year-over-year earnings\nper share growth over last five fiscal years);\nand debt-to-equity (i.e. , the latest fiscal\nyear total debt-to-book value). The\nmethodology calculates a \u201c quality score \u201d for\neach security in the parent index by averaging\nthe z-scores of each fundamental variable. A\nfixed number of securities with the highest\npositive quality scores are predetermined for\nthe Underlying Index at initial construction\nwith an aim to attain a high exposure to the\nquality factor while maintaining sufficient\nindex market capitalization and number of\nsecurities coverage. The weight of each\nUnderlying Index constituent is determined\nbased on the product of the security\u2019s quality\nscore and its market capitalization weight in\nthe parent index. Weights in the Underlying\nIndex are normalized so that sectors in the\nUnderlying Index represent the same weight as\nin the Parent Index. At each rebalance,\nconstituent weights in the Underlying Index\nare capped at 5% at the issuer level and\nbuffer rules are applied at 20% of the fixed\nnumber of securities in the Underlying Index.\nBetween rebalances, constituent weights may\nexceed these constraints due to fluctuations\nin market value, corporate actions or other\nevents that change index composition. The\nUnderlying Index is rebalanced semi-annually.\nThe fixed number of securities with the\nhighest positive quality scores that was\npredetermined for the Underlying Index at the\ninitial index construction is evaluated at\nevery Semi-Annual Index Review.\n\n31\n\nCalculation Methodology . The Fund utilizes\nthe Underlying Index calculated with net\ndividends reinvested. MSCI uses the index\nconstituent companies\u2019 country of\nincorporation to determine the relevant\ndividend withholding tax rates in calculating\nthe net dividends. The regular cash dividend\nis reinvested after deduction of withholding\ntax by applying the maximum rate of the\ncompany\u2019s country of incorporation applicable\nto institutional investors. Net dividends\nmeans dividends after taxes withheld at the\nrate applicable to non-resident institutional\ninvestors who do not benefit from double\ntaxation treaties. Such withholding rates may\ndiffer from those applicable to U.S.\nresidents. Investment Policies The Board has\nadopted as fundamental policies the following\nnumbered investment policies, which cannot be\nchanged without the approval of the holders of\na majority of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. A vote of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund is\ndefined in the Investment Company Act as the\nlesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting\nsecurities present at a shareholder meeting,\nif the holders of more than 50% of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (ii) more\nthan 50% of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund. The Fund has also adopted certain\nnon-fundamental investment policies, including\nits investment objective. Non-fundamental\ninvestment policies may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval. Therefore,\nthe Fund may change its investment objective\nand its Underlying Index without shareholder\napproval. Fundamental Investment Policies The\nFund may not: 1. Concentrate its investments\nin a particular industry, as that term is used\nin the Investment Company Act, except that the\nFund will concentrate to approximately the\nsame extent that its Underlying Index\nconcentrates in the securities of a particular\nindustry or group of industries. 2. Borrow\nmoney, except as permitted under the\nInvestment Company Act. 3. Issue senior\nsecurities to the extent such issuance would\nviolate the Investment Company Act. 4.\nPurchase or hold real estate, except the Fund\nmay purchase and hold securities or other\ninstruments that are secured by, or linked to,\nreal estate or interests therein, securities\nof REITs, mortgage-related securities and\nsecurities of issuers engaged in the real\nestate business, and the Fund may purchase and\nhold real estate as a result of the ownership\nof securities or other instruments. 5.\nUnderwrite securities issued by others, except\nto the extent that the sale of portfolio\nsecurities by the Fund may be deemed to be an\nunderwriting or as otherwise permitted by\napplicable law. 6. Purchase or sell\ncommodities or commodity contracts, except as\npermitted by the Investment Company Act. 7.\nMake loans to the extent prohibited by the\nInvestment Company Act. Notations Regarding\nthe Fund's Fundamental Investment Policies The\nfollowing notations are not considered to be\npart of the Fund\u2019s fundamental investment\npolicies and are subject to change without\nshareholder approval. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to concentration\nset forth in (1) above, the Investment Company\nAct does not define what constitutes \u201c\nconcentration \u201d in an industry. The SEC staff\nhas taken the position that investment of 25%\nor more of a fund\u2019s total assets in one or\nmore issuers conducting their principal\nactivities in the same industry or group of\nindustries constitutes concentration. It is\npossible that interpretations of concentration\ncould change in the future. The policy in (1)\nabove will be interpreted to refer to\nconcentration as that term may be interpreted\nfrom time to time. The policy also will be\ninterpreted to permit investment without limit\nin the following: securities of the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities; securities of state,\nterritory, possession or municipal governments\nand their authorities, agencies,\ninstrumentalities or political subdivisions;\nand repurchase agreements collateralized by\nany such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of\nthe foregoing securities will not be\nconsidered to be members of any industry.\nThere also will be no limit on investment in\nissuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or\ncountry. Finance companies will be considered\nto be in the industries of their parents if\ntheir activities are primarily related to\nfinancing the activities of the parents. Each\nforeign government will be considered to be a\nmember of a separate industry. With respect to\nthe Fund's industry classifications, the Fund\ncurrently utilizes any one or more of the\nindustry sub-classifications used by one or\nmore widely recognized market\n\n32\n\nindexes or rating group indexes, and/or as\ndefined by Fund management. The policy also\nwill be interpreted to give broad authority to\nthe Fund as to how to classify issuers within\nor among industries. With respect to the\nfundamental policy relating to borrowing money\nset forth in (2) above, the Investment Company\nAct permits the Fund to borrow money in\namounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total\nassets from banks for any purpose, and to\nborrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets\nfrom banks or other lenders for temporary\npurposes. (The Fund's total assets include the\namounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks\nattendant to borrowing, the Investment Company\nAct requires the Fund to maintain at all times\nan \u201c asset coverage \u201d of at least 300% of the\namount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means\nthe ratio that the value of the Fund's total\nassets (including amounts borrowed), minus\nliabilities other than borrowings, bears to\nthe aggregate amount of all borrowings.\nBorrowing money to increase portfolio holdings\nis known as \u201c leveraging. \u201d Certain trading\npractices and investments, such as reverse\nrepurchase agreements, may be considered to be\nborrowings or involve leverage and thus are\nsubject to the Investment Company Act\nrestrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4\nunder the Investment Company Act, when the\nFund engages in reverse repurchase agreements\nand similar financing transactions, the Fund\nmay either (i) maintain asset coverage of at\nleast 300% with respect to such transactions\nand any other borrowings in the aggregate, or\n(ii) treat such transactions as \u201c derivatives\ntransactions \u201d and comply with Rule 18f-4 with\nrespect to such transactions. Short-term\ncredits necessary for the settlement of\nsecurities transactions and arrangements with\nrespect to securities lending will not be\nconsidered to be borrowings under the policy.\nPractices and investments that may involve\nleverage but are not considered to be\nborrowings are not subject to the policy. With\nrespect to the fundamental policy relating to\nunderwriting set forth in (5) above, the\nInvestment Company Act does not prohibit a\nfund from engaging in the underwriting\nbusiness or from underwriting the securities\nof other issuers; in fact, in the case of\ndiversified funds, the Investment Company Act\npermits a fund to have underwriting\ncommitments of up to 25% of its assets under\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances\ncurrently are that the amount of a fund\u2019s\nunderwriting commitments, when added to the\nvalue of a fund\u2019s investments in issuers where\na fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding\nvoting securities of those issuers, cannot\nexceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in\ntransactions involving the acquisition or\ndisposition of portfolio securities may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter under the 1933\nAct. Although it is not believed that the\napplication of the 1933 Act provisions\ndescribed above would cause a fund to be\nengaged in the business of underwriting, the\npolicy in (5) above will be interpreted not to\nprevent a fund from engaging in transactions\ninvolving the acquisition or disposition of\nportfolio securities, regardless of whether a\nfund may be considered to be an underwriter\nunder the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in\nthe underwriting business to the extent\npermitted by applicable law. With respect to\nthe fundamental policy relating to lending set\nforth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act\ndoes not prohibit the Fund from making loans\n(including lending its securities); however,\nSEC staff interpretations currently prohibit\nfunds from lending more than one-third of\ntheir total assets (including lending its\nsecurities), except through the purchase of\ndebt obligations or the use of repurchase\nagreements. In addition, collateral\narrangements with respect to options, forward\ncurrency and futures transactions and other\nderivative instruments (as applicable), as\nwell as delays in the settlement of securities\ntransactions, will not be considered loans.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Policies of the\nFund Under its non-fundamental investment\nrestrictions, which may be changed by the\nBoard without shareholder approval, the Fund\nmay not: 1. Purchase shares of any registered\nopen-end investment company or registered unit\ninvestment trust, in reliance on Section\n12(d)(1)(F) or (G) of the Investment Company\nAct, at any time the Fund has knowledge that\nits shares are purchased by another investment\ncompany investor in reliance on the provisions\nof subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1). The\nforegoing restriction does not restrict the\nFund from acquiring the shares of registered\nopen-end investment companies to the extent\notherwise permissible under other provisions\nof the 1940 Act, as interpreted, modified or\notherwise permitted by regulatory authority\nhaving jurisdiction, from time to time. 2. In\naccordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act,\nunder normal circumstances, invest less than\n80% of the value of its net assets, plus the\namount of any borrowings for investment\npurposes, in the component securities of its\nUnderlying Index or in depositary receipts\nrepresenting component securities in its\nUnderlying Index. The Fund will notify its\nshareholders at least 60 days prior to any\nchange in its restrictions described in 2\nabove. Notations Regarding the Fund\u2019s\nFundamental and Non-Fundamental Investment\nPolicies\n\n33\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all limitations\nunder the Fund\u2019s fundamental or non-\nfundamental investment restrictions apply only\nat the time that a transaction is undertaken.\nAny change in the percentage of the Fund\u2019s\nassets invested in certain securities or other\ninstruments resulting from market fluctuations\nor other changes in the Fund\u2019s total assets\nwill not require the Fund to dispose of an\ninvestment. Continuous Offering The method by\nwhich Creation Units are created and traded\nmay raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units\nare issued and sold by the Fund on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as\nsuch term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery requirement and\nliability provisions of the 1933 Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client\nmay be deemed a statutory underwriter if it\ntakes Creation Units after placing an order\nwith the Distributor, breaks them down into\nconstituent shares and sells such shares\ndirectly to customers or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of new shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the 1933 Act must take into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-\ndealer or its client in the particular case\nand the examples mentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should\nalso note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions\nin shares, whether or not participating in the\ndistribution of shares, generally are required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in\nrespect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus delivery obligation with\nrespect to shares of the Fund are reminded\nthat, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act,\na prospectus delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange\nmember in connection with a sale on the\nListing Exchange generally is satisfied by the\nfact that the prospectus is available at the\nListing Exchange upon request. The prospectus\ndelivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is\navailable only with respect to transactions on\nan exchange. Management Trustees and Officers.\nThe Board has responsibility for the overall\nmanagement and operations of the Fund,\nincluding general supervision of the duties\nperformed by BFA and other service providers.\nEach Trustee serves until he or she resigns,\nis removed, dies, retires or becomes\nincapacitated. Each officer shall hold office\nuntil his or her successor is elected and\nqualifies or until his or her death,\nresignation or removal. Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Trust are referred to as\nindependent trustees ( \u201c Independent Trustees\n\u201d ). The registered investment companies\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates (the \u201c\nBlackRock-advised Funds \u201d ) are organized into\nthe BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex, the\nBlackRock Fixed-Income Complex and the iShares\nComplex (each, a \u201c BlackRock Fund Complex \u201d ).\nThe Fund is included in the iShares Complex,\nwhich includes iShares Trust, iShares U.S. ETF\nTrust, and iShares, Inc. Each Trustee also\nserves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a\nTrustee of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a\nresult, oversees all of the funds within the\niShares Complex, which consists of 420 funds\nas of November 6, 2024. With the exception of\nStephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron\nWasserman, the address of each Trustee and\nofficer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address\nof Mr. Kapito and Mr. Wasserman is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY\n10001. The address of Mr. Cohen is c/o\nBlackRock, Inc., Drapers Gardens, 12\nThrogmorton Avenue, London EC2N 2DL United\nKingdom.

Board \u2013 Leadership Structure and\nOversight Responsibilities Overall\nresponsibility for oversight of the Fund rests\nwith the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to\nmanage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The\nBoard is responsible for overseeing BFA and\nother service providers in the operations of\nthe Fund in accordance with the provisions of\nthe 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state\nand other laws and the Trust\u2019s charter. The\nBoard is currently composed of eleven members,\nnine of whom are Independent Trustees. The\nBoard currently conducts regular in person\nmeetings four times a year. In addition, the\nBoard frequently holds special in person or\ntelephonic meetings or informal conference\ncalls to discuss specific matters that may\narise or require action between regular\nmeetings. The Independent Trustees meet\nregularly outside the presence of management,\nin executive session or with other service\nproviders to the Trust. The Board has\nappointed an Independent Trustee to serve in\nthe role of Board Chair. The Board Chair\u2019s\nrole is to preside at all meetings of the\nBoard and to act as a liaison with service\nproviders, officers, attorneys, and other\nTrustees generally between meetings. The Board\nChair may also perform such other functions as\nmay be delegated by the Board from time to\ntime. The Board has established seven standing\nCommittees: a Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c)\nCommittee, a Securities Lending Committee, a\nRisk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a\nFixed Income Plus Committee to assist the\nBoard in the oversight and direction of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Fund, and from\ntime to time the Board may establish ad hoc\ncommittees or informal working groups to\nreview and address the policies and practices\nof the Fund with respect to certain specified\nmatters. The Chair of each standing Committee\nis an Independent Trustee. The role of the\nChair of each Committee is to preside at all\nmeetings of the Committee and to act as a\nliaison with service providers, officers,\nattorneys and other Trustees between meetings.\nEach standing Committee meets regularly to\nconduct the oversight functions delegated to\nthe Committee by the Board and reports its\nfinding to the Board. The Board and each\nstanding Committee conduct annual assessments\nof their oversight function and structure. The\nBoard has determined that the Board\u2019s\nleadership structure is appropriate because it\nallows the Board to exercise independent\njudgment over management and it allocates\nareas of responsibility among committees of\nIndependent Trustees and the full Board to\nenhance effective oversight. Day-to-day risk\nmanagement with respect to the Fund is the\nresponsibility of BFA or other service\nproviders (depending on the nature of the\nrisk), subject to the supervision of BFA. The\nFund is subject to a number of risks,\nincluding investment, compliance, operational,\nreputational, counterparty and valuation\nrisks, among others. While there are a number\nof risk management functions performed by BFA\nand other service providers, as applicable, it\nis not possible to identify and eliminate all\nof the risks applicable to the Fund. The\nTrustees have an oversight role in this area,\nsatisfying themselves that risk management\nprocesses and controls are in place and\noperating effectively. Risk oversight forms\npart of the Board\u2019s general oversight of the\nFund and is addressed as part of various Board\nand committee activities. In some cases, risk\nmanagement issues are specifically addressed\nin presentations and discussions. For example,\nBFA has an independent dedicated Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis Group ( \u201c RQA \u201d ) that\nassists BFA in managing fiduciary and\ncorporate risks, including investment,\noperational, counterparty credit and\nenterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet\nwith the Board to discuss their analysis and\nmethodologies, as well as specific risk topics\nsuch as operational and counterparty risks\nrelating to the Fund. The Board, directly or\nthrough a committee, also reviews reports\nfrom, among others, management and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks\nfaced by the Fund and management\u2019s risk\nfunctions. The Board has appointed a Chief\nCompliance Officer who oversees the\nimplementation and testing of the Trust's\ncompliance program, including assessments by\nindependent third parties, and reports to the\nBoard regarding compliance matters for the\nTrust and its principal service providers. In\ntesting and maintaining the compliance\nprogram, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his\nor her delegates) assesses key compliance\nrisks affecting the Fund, and addresses them\nin periodic reports to the Board. In addition,\nthe Audit Committee meets with both the Fund's\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand BFA\u2019s internal audit group to review risk\ncontrols in place that support the Fund as\nwell as test results. Board oversight of risk\nis also performed as needed between meetings\nthrough communications between BFA and the\nBoard. The Independent Trustees have engaged\nindependent legal counsel to assist them in\nperforming their oversight\n\n42\n\nresponsibilities. From time to time, the Board\nmay modify the manner in which it conducts\nrisk oversight. The Board\u2019s oversight role\ndoes not make it a guarantor of the Fund's\ninvestment performance or other activities.\nCommittees of the Board of Trustees.

Certain activities of\nBFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other\nsubsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively\nreferred to in this section as \u201c BlackRock \u201d )\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, with respect to the Fund and/or\nother accounts managed by BlackRock, may give\nrise to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest such as those described below.\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest asset\nmanagement firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries\nand their respective directors, officers and\nemployees, including the business units or\nentities and personnel who may be involved in\nthe investment activities and business\noperations of the Fund, are engaged worldwide\nin businesses, including managing equities,\nfixed-income securities, cash and alternative\ninvestments, and have interests other than\nthat of managing the Fund. These are\nconsiderations of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware, and which may cause conflicts\nof interest that could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. These businesses and\ninterests include potential multiple advisory,\nfinancial and other relationships with, or\ninterests in, companies and interests in\nsecurities or other instruments that may be\npurchased or sold by the Fund. BlackRock has\nproprietary interests in, and may manage or\nadvise with respect to, accounts or funds\n(including separate accounts and other funds\nand collective investment vehicles) that have\ninvestment objectives similar to those of the\nFund and/or that engage in transactions in the\nsame types of securities, currencies and\ninstruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also a\nmajor participant in the global currency,\nequities, swap and fixed-income markets, in\neach case, for the accounts of clients and, in\nsome cases, on a proprietary basis. As such,\nBlackRock is or may be actively engaged in\ntransactions in the same securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests. Such activities could affect the\nprices and availability of the securities,\ncurrencies, and instruments in which the Fund\ninvests, which could have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's performance. Such transactions,\nparticularly in respect of most proprietary\naccounts or client accounts, will be executed\nindependently of the Fund's transactions and\nthus at prices or rates that may be more or\nless favorable than those obtained by the\nFund. When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell\nthe same assets for managed accounts,\nincluding the Fund, the assets actually\npurchased or sold may be allocated among the\naccounts on a basis determined in its good\nfaith discretion to be equitable. In some\ncases, this system may adversely affect the\nsize or price of the assets purchased or sold\nfor the Fund. In addition, transactions in\ninvestments by one or more other accounts\nmanaged by BlackRock may have the effect of\ndiluting or otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment strategies of the\nFund, particularly, but not limited to, with\nrespect to small-capitalization, emerging\nmarket or less liquid strategies. This may\noccur with respect to BlackRock-advised\naccounts when investment decisions regarding\nthe Fund are based on research or other\ninformation that is also used to support\ndecisions for other accounts. When BlackRock\nimplements a portfolio decision or strategy on\nbehalf of another account ahead of, or\ncontemporaneously with, similar decisions or\nstrategies for the Fund, market impact,\nliquidity constraints, or other factors could\nresult in the Fund receiving less favorable\ntrading results and the costs of implementing\nsuch decisions or strategies could be\nincreased or the Fund could otherwise be\ndisadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain\ncases, elect to implement internal policies\nand procedures designed to limit such\nconsequences, which may cause the Fund to be\nunable to engage in certain activities,\nincluding purchasing or disposing of\nsecurities, when it might otherwise be\ndesirable for it to do so.\n\n48\n\nConflicts may also arise because portfolio\ndecisions regarding the Fund may benefit other\naccounts managed by BlackRock. For example,\nthe sale of a long position or establishment\nof a short position by the Fund may impair the\nprice of the same security sold short by (and\ntherefore benefit) BlackRock or its other\naccounts or funds, and the purchase of a\nsecurity or covering of a short position in a\nsecurity by the Fund may increase the price of\nthe same security held by (and therefore\nbenefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or\nfunds. In addition, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, the Fund may invest its assets\nin other funds advised by BlackRock, including\nfunds that are managed by one or more of the\nsame portfolio managers, which could result in\nconflicts of interest relating to asset\nallocation, timing of Fund purchases and\nsales, and increased remuneration and\nprofitability for BlackRock, and/or its\npersonnel, including portfolio managers. In\ncertain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of\nthe Fund, may seek to buy from or sell\nsecurities to another fund or account advised\nby BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not\nrequired to) effect purchases and sales\nbetween BlackRock clients ( \u201c cross trades \u201d\n), including the Fund, if BlackRock believes\nsuch transactions are appropriate based on\neach party's investment objectives and\nguidelines, subject to applicable law and\nregulation. There may be potential conflicts\nof interest or regulatory issues relating to\nthese transactions which could limit\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to engage in these\ntransactions for the Fund. BlackRock may have\na potentially conflicting division of\nloyalties and responsibilities to the parties\nin such transactions. On any occasion when the\nFund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock\nwill comply with procedures adopted under\napplicable rules and SEC guidance. BlackRock\nand its clients may pursue or enforce rights\nwith respect to an issuer in which the Fund\nhas invested, and those activities may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. As a result,\nprices, availability, liquidity and terms of\nthe Fund's investments may be negatively\nimpacted by the activities of BlackRock or its\nclients, and transactions for the Fund may be\nimpaired or effected at prices or terms that\nmay be less favorable than would otherwise\nhave been the case. The results of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment activities may differ significantly\nfrom the results achieved by BlackRock for its\nproprietary accounts or other accounts\n(including investment companies or collective\ninvestment vehicles) which it manages or\nadvises. It is possible that one or more\naccounts managed or advised by BlackRock and\nsuch other accounts will achieve investment\nresults that are substantially more or less\nfavorable than the results achieved by the\nFund. Moreover, it is possible that the Fund\nwill sustain losses during periods in which\none or more proprietary or other accounts\nmanaged or advised by BlackRock achieve\nsignificant profits. The opposite result is\nalso possible. From time to time, the Fund may\nbe restricted from purchasing or selling\nsecurities, or from engaging in other\ninvestment activities because of regulatory,\nlegal or contractual requirements applicable\nto BlackRock or other accounts managed or\nadvised by BlackRock, and/or the internal\npolicies of BlackRock designed to comply with\nsuch requirements. As a result, there may be\nperiods, for example, when BlackRock will not\ninitiate or recommend certain types of\ntransactions in certain securities or\ninstruments with respect to which BlackRock is\nperforming services or when position limits\nhave been reached. For example, the investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and accounts under its management may\nlimit the investment opportunities for the\nFund in certain emerging and other markets in\nwhich limitations are imposed upon the amount\nof investment, in the aggregate or in\nindividual issuers, by affiliated foreign\ninvestors. In connection with its management\nof the Fund, BlackRock may have access to\ncertain fundamental analysis and proprietary\ntechnical models developed by BlackRock.\nBlackRock will not be under any obligation,\nhowever, to effect transactions on behalf of\nthe Fund in accordance with such analysis and\nmodels. In addition, BlackRock will not have\nany obligation to make available any\ninformation regarding its proprietary\nactivities or strategies, or the activities or\nstrategies used for other accounts managed by\nthem, for the benefit of the management of the\nFund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock\nwill have access to such information for the\npurpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary\nactivities or portfolio strategies of\nBlackRock, or the activities or strategies\nused for accounts managed by BlackRock or\nother client accounts could conflict with the\ntransactions and strategies employed by\nBlackRock in managing the Fund. The Fund may\nbe included in investment models developed by\nBlackRock for use by clients and financial\nadvisors. To the extent clients invest in\nthese investment models and increase the\nassets under management of the Fund, the\ninvestment management fee amounts paid by the\nFund to BlackRock may also increase. The\nprice, availability and liquidity of the Fund\nmay be impacted by purchases and sales of the\nFund by model-driven investment portfolios, as\nwell as by BlackRock itself and by its\nadvisory clients. In addition, certain\nprincipals and certain employees of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment adviser are also principals or\nemployees of other business units or entities\nwithin BlackRock. As a result, these\nprincipals and employees may have obligations\nto such\n\n49\n\nother business units or entities or their\nclients and such obligations to other business\nunits or entities or their clients may be a\nconsideration of which investors in the Fund\nshould be aware. BlackRock may enter into\ntransactions and invest in securities,\ninstruments and currencies on behalf of the\nFund in which clients of BlackRock or, to the\nextent permitted by the SEC and applicable\nlaw, BlackRock serves as the counterparty,\nprincipal or issuer. In such cases, such\nparty's interests in the transaction will be\nadverse to the interests of the Fund, and such\nparty may have no incentive to assure that the\nFund obtains the best possible prices or terms\nin connection with the transactions. In\naddition, the purchase, holding and sale of\nsuch investments by the Fund may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock may also\ncreate, write or issue derivatives for clients\nbased on the underlying securities, currencies\nor instruments in which the Fund may invest or\non the performance of the Fund. An entity in\nwhich BlackRock has a significant minority\ninterest will create, write or issue options\nwhich may be based on the performance of\ncertain Funds. BlackRock has the right to\nreceive a portion of the gross revenue earned\nby such entity. Options writing by such entity\non the Fund could potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthe Fund and increased assets under management\nfor BlackRock. BlackRock has entered into an\narrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the\nindex provider for underlying fixed-income\nindexes used by certain iShares funds, related\nto derivative fixed-income products that are\nbased on such iShares funds. BlackRock may\nreceive certain payments for licensing\nintellectual property belonging to BlackRock\nand for facilitating the provision of data in\nconnection with such derivative products,\nwhich may include payments based on the\ntrading volumes of, or revenues generated by,\nthe derivative products. However, BlackRock\nwill not receive any such payments on those\nderivative products utilized by the Fund or\nother BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds\nand accounts managed by BlackRock may from\ntime to time transact in such derivative\nproducts, which could contribute to the\nviability or success of such derivative\nproducts by making them more appealing to\nfunds and accounts managed by third parties,\nand in turn lead to increased payments to\nBlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative\nproducts could also potentially lead to\nincreased purchase activity with respect to\nthese iShares funds and increased assets under\nmanagement for BlackRock. The Fund may,\nsubject to applicable law, purchase\ninvestments that are the subject of an\nunderwriting or other distribution by\nBlackRock and may also enter into transactions\nwith other clients of BlackRock where such\nother clients have interests adverse to those\nof the Fund. At times, these activities may\ncause business units or entities within\nBlackRock to give advice to clients that may\ncause these clients to take actions adverse to\nthe interests of the Fund. To the extent such\ntransactions are permitted, the Fund will deal\nwith BlackRock on an arm\u2019s-length basis. To\nthe extent authorized by applicable law,\nBlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent,\nlender or adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund. It is anticipated\nthat the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs,\nfinancial advisory fees, underwriting and\nplacement fees, sales fees, financing and\ncommitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees,\ncompensation or profits, rates, terms and\nconditions charged by BlackRock will be in its\nview commercially reasonable, although\nBlackRock, including its sales personnel, will\nhave an interest in obtaining fees and other\namounts that are favorable to BlackRock and\nsuch sales personnel, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund. Index based funds\nmay use an index provider that is affiliated\nwith another service provider of the Fund or\nBlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer,\nagent, lender or in other commercial\ncapacities for the Fund or BlackRock. Subject\nto applicable law, BlackRock (and its\npersonnel and other distributors) will be\nentitled to retain fees and other amounts that\nthey receive in connection with their service\nto the Fund as broker, dealer, agent, lender,\nadviser or in other commercial capacities. No\naccounting to the Fund or its shareholders\nwill be required, and no fees or other\ncompensation payable by the Fund or its\nshareholders will be reduced by reason of\nreceipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other\namounts. When BlackRock acts as broker,\ndealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial\ncapacities in relation to the Fund, BlackRock\nmay take commercial steps in its own\ninterests, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund. The Fund will be required to\nestablish business relationships with its\ncounterparties based on the Fund's own credit\nstanding. BlackRock will not have any\nobligation to allow its credit to be used in\nconnection with the Fund's establishment of\nits business relationships, nor is it expected\nthat the Fund's counterparties will rely on\nthe credit of BlackRock in evaluating the\nFund's creditworthiness. BTC, an affiliate of\nBFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as\nsecurities lending agent to, and receives a\nshare of securities lending revenues from, the\nFund. BlackRock will also receive compensation\nfor managing the reinvestment of the cash\ncollateral from securities lending. There are\npotential conflicts of interests in managing a\nsecurities lending program,\n\n50\n\nincluding but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto, among other things, increase or decrease\nthe amount of securities on loan or to lend\nparticular securities in order to generate\nadditional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock\nand its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as\nsecurities lending agent may have an incentive\nto allocate loans to clients that would\nprovide more revenue to BlackRock. As\ndescribed further below, BlackRock seeks to\nmitigate this conflict by providing its\nsecurities lending clients with equal lending\nopportunities over time in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation. As part of\nits securities lending program, BlackRock\nindemnifies the Fund and certain other clients\nand/or funds against a shortfall in collateral\nin the event of borrower default. On a regular\nbasis, BlackRock calculates the potential\ndollar exposure of collateral shortfall\nresulting from a borrower default ( \u201c\nshortfall risk \u201d ) in the securities lending\nprogram. BlackRock establishes program-wide\nborrower limits ( \u201c credit limits \u201d ) to\nactively manage borrower-specific credit\nexposure. BlackRock oversees the risk model\nthat calculates projected collateral shortfall\nvalues using loan-level factors such as loan\nand collateral type and market value as well\nas specific borrower credit characteristics.\nWhen necessary, BlackRock may adjust\nsecurities lending program attributes by\nrestricting eligible collateral or reducing\nborrower credit limits. As a result, the\nmanagement of program-wide exposure as well as\nBlackRock-specific indemnification exposure\nmay affect the amount of securities lending\nactivity BlackRock may conduct at any given\npoint in time by reducing the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain loans\n(including by asset type, collateral type\nand/or revenue profile). BlackRock may decline\nto make a securities loan on behalf of the\nFund, discontinue lending on behalf of the\nFund or terminate a securities loan on behalf\nof the Fund for any reason, including but not\nlimited to regulatory requirements and/or\nmarket rules, liquidity considerations, or\ncredit considerations, which may impact Funds\nby reducing or eliminating the volume of\nlending opportunities for certain types of\nloans, loans in particular markets, loans of\nparticular securities or types of securities,\nor for loans overall. In addition, some bank\nborrowers may prefer certain BlackRock lenders\nthat provide additional protections against\nlender default that are favored by their\nprudential regulation. BlackRock uses a\npredetermined systematic process in order to\napproximate pro rata allocation over time. In\norder to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i)\nBlackRock as a whole must have sufficient\nlending capacity pursuant to the various\nprogram limits ( i.e ., indemnification\nexposure limit and borrower credit limits);\n(ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset\nat the time a loan opportunity arrives; and\n(iii) the lending portfolio must also have\nenough inventory, either on its own or when\naggregated with other portfolios into one\nsingle market delivery, to satisfy the loan\nrequest. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to\nprovide equal lending opportunities for all\nportfolios, independent of whether BlackRock\nindemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities\nfor lending portfolios does not guarantee\nequal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-\nterm outcomes for individual clients may vary\ndue to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on\ndifferent securities, and the overall limits\nimposed by the firm. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities and other assets for the Fund may\nbe bunched or aggregated with orders for other\nBlackRock client accounts, including with\naccounts that pay different transaction costs\nsolely due to the fact that they have\ndifferent research payment arrangements.\nBlackRock, however, is not required to bunch\nor aggregate orders if portfolio management\ndecisions for different accounts are made\nseparately, or if they determine that bunching\nor aggregating is not practicable or required,\nor in cases involving client direction.\nPrevailing trading activity frequently may\nmake impossible the receipt of the same price\nor execution on the entire volume of\nsecurities purchased or sold. When this\noccurs, the various prices may be averaged,\nand the Fund will be charged or credited with\nthe average price. Thus, the effect of the\naggregation may operate on some occasions to\nthe disadvantage of the Fund. In addition,\nunder certain circumstances, the Fund will not\nbe charged the same commission or commission\nequivalent rates in connection with a bunched\nor aggregated order. Subject to applicable\nlaw, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish\nBlackRock, the Fund, other BlackRock client\naccounts or personnel, directly or through\ncorrespondent relationships, with research or\nother appropriate services which provide, in\nBlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to\nBlackRock in the investment decision-making\nprocess (including with respect to futures,\nfixed-price offerings and OTC transactions).\nSuch research or other services may include,\nto the extent permitted by law, research\nreports on companies, industries and\nsecurities; economic and financial data;\nfinancial publications; proxy analysis; trade\nindustry seminars; computer data bases;\nresearch-oriented software and other services\nand products. Research or other services\nobtained in this manner may be used in\nservicing any or all of the Fund and other\nBlackRock client accounts, including in\nconnection with BlackRock client accounts\nother than those that pay commissions to the\nbroker relating to the research or other\nservice arrangements. Such products and\nservices may disproportionately benefit other\n\n51\n\nBlackRock client accounts relative to the Fund\nbased on the amount of brokerage commissions\npaid by the Fund and such other BlackRock\nclient accounts. For example, research or\nother services that are paid for through one\nclient's commissions may not be used in\nmanaging that client's account. In addition,\nother BlackRock client accounts may receive\nthe benefit, including disproportionate\nbenefits, of economies of scale or price\ndiscounts in connection with products and\nservices that may be provided to the Fund and\nto such other BlackRock client accounts. To\nthe extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars,\nit will not have to pay for those products and\nservices itself. BlackRock does not currently\nenter into arrangements to use the Fund's\nassets for, or participate in, soft dollars,\nalthough BlackRock may receive research that\nis bundled with the trade execution, clearing,\nand/or settlement services provided by a\nparticular broker-dealer. To the extent that\nBlackRock receives research on this basis,\nmany of the same conflicts related to\ntraditional soft dollars may exist. For\nexample, the research effectively will be paid\nby client commissions that also will be used\nto pay for the execution, clearing, and\nsettlement services provided by the broker-\ndealer and will not be paid by BlackRock.\nBlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable\nlaw, may endeavor to execute trades through\nbrokers who, pursuant to such arrangements,\nprovide research or other services in order to\nensure the continued receipt of research or\nother services BlackRock believes are useful\nin its investment decision-making process.\nBlackRock may from time to time choose not to\nengage in the above described arrangements to\nvarying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited\nby applicable law, may also enter into\ncommission sharing arrangements under which\nBlackRock may execute transactions through a\nbroker-dealer, and request that the broker-\ndealer allocate a portion of the commissions\nor commission credits to another firm that\nprovides research to BlackRock. To the extent\nthat BlackRock engages in commission sharing\narrangements, many of the same conflicts\nrelated to traditional soft dollars may exist.\nBlackRock may utilize certain electronic\ncrossing networks ( \u201c ECNs \u201d ) (including,\nwithout limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock\nhas an investment or other interest, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law) in\nexecuting client securities transactions for\ncertain types of securities. These ECNs may\ncharge fees for their services, including\naccess fees and transaction fees. The\ntransaction fees, which are similar to\ncommissions or markups/markdowns, will\ngenerally be charged to clients and, like\ncommissions and markups/markdowns, would\ngenerally be included in the cost of the\nsecurities purchased. Access fees may be paid\nby BlackRock even though incurred in\nconnection with executing transactions on\nbehalf of clients, including the Fund. In\ncertain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume\ndiscounts that will reduce the access fees\ntypically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will\nonly utilize ECNs consistent with its\nobligation to seek to obtain best execution in\nclient transactions. BlackRock owns a minority\ninterest in, and is a member of, Members\nExchange ( \u201c MEMX \u201d ), a newly created U.S.\nstock exchange. Transactions for the Fund may\nbe executed on MEMX if third party brokers\nselect MEMX as the appropriate venue for\nexecution of orders placed by BlackRock\ntraders on behalf of such Funds. In addition,\ntransactions in Fund shares may be executed on\nMEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the\nappropriate venue for the execution of such\norders. BlackRock has adopted policies and\nprocedures designed to prevent conflicts of\ninterest from influencing proxy voting\ndecisions that it makes on behalf of advisory\nclients, including the Fund, and to help\nensure that such decisions are made in\naccordance with BlackRock's fiduciary\nobligations to its clients. Nevertheless,\nnotwithstanding such proxy voting policies and\nprocedures, actual proxy voting decisions of\nBlackRock may have the effect of favoring the\ninterests of other clients or businesses of\nother divisions or units of BlackRock,\nprovided that BlackRock believes such voting\ndecisions to be in accordance with its\nfiduciary obligations. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of these policies and procedures,\nsee the Proxy Voting Policy section of this\nSAI. It is also possible that, from time to\ntime, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients\n(including other funds and separately managed\naccounts) may, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold shares of\nthe Fund. Increasing the Fund\u2019s assets may\nenhance liquidity, investment flexibility and\ndiversification and may contribute to\neconomies of scale that tend to reduce the\nFund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the\nright, subject to compliance with applicable\nlaw, to sell into the market or redeem in\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant at any time some or all of the\nshares of the Fund acquired for its own\naccounts or the account of a BlackRock\nadvisory client. A large sale or redemption of\nshares of the Fund by BlackRock itself or a\nBlackRock advisory client could significantly\nreduce the asset size of the Fund, which might\nhave an adverse effect on the Fund's\nliquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio\ndiversification, expense ratio or ability to\ncomply with the listing requirements for the\nFund. It is possible that the Fund may invest\nin securities of, or engage in transactions\nwith, companies in which BlackRock has\nsignificant debt or equity investments or\nother interests. The Fund may also invest in\nissuances (such as structured notes) by\nentities for which BlackRock provides and is\ncompensated for cash management services\nrelating to the proceeds from the\n\n52\n\nsale of such issuances. In making investment\ndecisions for the Fund, BlackRock is not\npermitted to obtain or use material non-public\ninformation acquired by any unit of BlackRock\nin the course of these activities. In\naddition, from time to time, the activities of\nBlackRock may limit the Fund's flexibility in\npurchases and sales of securities. As\nindicated below, BlackRock may engage in\ntransactions with companies in which\nBlackRock-advised funds or other clients of\nBlackRock have an investment. BlackRock, its\npersonnel and other financial service\nproviders may have interests in promoting\nsales of the Fund. With respect to BlackRock\nand its personnel, the remuneration and\nprofitability relating to services to and\nsales of the Fund or other products may be\ngreater than remuneration and profitability\nrelating to services to and sales of certain\nfunds or other products that might be provided\nor offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel\nmay directly or indirectly receive a portion\nof the fees and commissions charged to the\nFund or its shareholders. BlackRock and its\nadvisory or other personnel may also benefit\nfrom increased amounts of assets under\nmanagement. Fees and commissions may also be\nhigher than for other products or services,\nand the remuneration and profitability to\nBlackRock and such personnel resulting from\ntransactions on behalf of or management of the\nFund may be greater than the remuneration and\nprofitability resulting from other funds or\nproducts. Third parties, including service\nproviders to BlackRock or the Fund, may\nsponsor events (including, but not limited to,\nmarketing and promotional activities and\npresentations, educational training programs\nand conferences) for registered\nrepresentatives, other professionals and\nindividual investors. There is a potential\nconflict of interest as such sponsorships may\ndefray the costs of such activities to\nBlackRock, and may provide an incentive to\nBlackRock to retain such third parties to\nprovide services to the Fund. BlackRock may\nprovide valuation assistance to certain\nclients with respect to certain securities or\nother investments and the valuation\nrecommendations made for such clients'\naccounts may differ from the valuations for\nthe same securities or investments assigned by\nthe Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such\nvaluations are based on broker-dealer quotes\nor other data sources unavailable to the\nFund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will\ngenerally communicate its valuation\ninformation or determinations to the Fund's\npricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there\nmay be instances where the Fund's pricing\nvendors or fund accountants assign a different\nvaluation to a security or other investment\nthan the valuation for such security or\ninvestment determined or recommended by\nBlackRock. As disclosed in more detail in the\nDetermination of Net Asset Value section in\nthis SAI, when market quotations are not\nreadily available or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value by BFA. BFA has been designated\nas the Fund\u2019s valuation designee pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and\nacts through BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the \u201c\n2a-5 Committee \u201d ), with assistance from other\nBFA pricing committees and in accordance with\nBFA\u2019s policies and procedures (the \u201c Valuation\nProcedures \u201d ). When determining a \u201c fair\nvalue price, \u201d the 2a-5 Committee seeks to\ndetermine the price that the Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive from the current\nsale of that asset or liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. The price generally\nmay not be determined based on what the Fund\nmight reasonably expect to receive for selling\nan asset or liability at a later time or if it\nholds the asset or liability to maturity.\nWhile fair value determinations will be based\nupon all available factors that BFA deems\nrelevant at the time of the determination, and\nmay be based on analytical values determined\nby BFA using proprietary or third-party\nvaluation models, fair value represents only a\ngood faith approximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair value of one or\nmore assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at\nfair value, may have the effect of diluting or\nincreasing the economic interest of existing\nshareholders and may affect the amount of\nrevenue received by BFA with respect to\nservices for which it receives an asset-based\nfee. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, the Fund may invest all or some of its\nshort-term cash investments in any money\nmarket fund or similarly-managed private fund\nadvised or managed by BlackRock. In connection\nwith any such investments, the Fund, to the\nextent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its\nshare of expenses of a money market fund or\nother similarly-managed private fund in which\nit invests, which may result in the Fund\nbearing some additional expenses. BlackRock\nand its directors, officers and employees, may\nbuy and sell securities or other investments\nfor their own accounts and may have conflicts\nof interest with respect to investments made\non behalf of the Fund. As a result of\ndiffering trading and investment strategies or\nconstraints, positions may be taken by\ndirectors, officers and employees that are the\nsame, different from or made at different\ntimes than positions taken for the Fund. To\nlessen the possibility that the Fund will be\nadversely affected by this personal trading,\nthe Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted\na code of ethics in compliance\n\n53\n\nwith Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that\nrestricts securities trading in the personal\naccounts of investment professionals and\nothers who normally come into possession of\ninformation regarding the Fund's portfolio\ntransactions. Each code of ethics is available\nby contacting BlackRock at the telephone\nnumber on the back cover of the Fund\u2019s\nProspectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database\non the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. BlackRock will\nnot purchase securities or other property\nfrom, or sell securities or other property to,\nthe Fund, except that the Fund may in\naccordance with rules or guidance adopted\nunder the 1940 Act engage in transactions with\nanother Fund or accounts that are affiliated\nwith the Fund as a result of common officers,\ndirectors, or investment advisers or pursuant\nto exemptive orders granted to the Fund and/or\nBlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would\nbe effected in circumstances in which\nBlackRock determined that it would be\nappropriate for the Fund to purchase and\nanother client of BlackRock to sell, or the\nFund to sell and another client of BlackRock\nto purchase, the same security or instrument\non the same day. From time to time, the\nactivities of the Fund may be restricted\nbecause of regulatory requirements applicable\nto BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal\npolicies designed to comply with, limit the\napplicability of, or otherwise relate to such\nrequirements. A client not advised by\nBlackRock would not be subject to some of\nthose considerations. There may be periods\nwhen BlackRock may not initiate or recommend\ncertain types of transactions, or may\notherwise restrict or limit its advice in\ncertain securities or instruments issued by or\nrelated to companies for which BlackRock is\nperforming advisory or other services or has\nproprietary positions. For example, when\nBlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or\nrisk management services for a company,\nBlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in\npurchasing or selling securities of that\ncompany on behalf of the Fund, particularly\nwhere such services result in BlackRock\nobtaining material non-public information\nabout the company ( e.g. , in connection with\nparticipation in a creditors\u2019 committee).\nSimilar situations could arise if personnel of\nBlackRock serve as directors of companies the\nsecurities of which the Fund wishes to\npurchase or sell. However, if permitted by\napplicable law, and where consistent with\nBlackRock\u2019s policies and procedures (including\nthe necessary implementation of appropriate\ninformation barriers), the Fund may purchase\nsecurities or instruments that are issued by\nsuch companies, are the subject of an advisory\nor risk management assignment by BlackRock, or\nwhere personnel of BlackRock are directors or\nofficers of the issuer. The investment\nactivities of BlackRock for its proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts may also\nlimit the investment strategies and rights of\nthe Fund. For example, in certain\ncircumstances where the Fund invests in\nsecurities issued by companies that operate in\ncertain regulated industries or in certain\nemerging or international markets, or is\nsubject to corporate or regulatory ownership\nrestrictions, or invests in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions, there may be\nlimits on the aggregate amount invested by\nBlackRock for their proprietary accounts and\nfor client accounts (including the Fund) that\nmay not be exceeded without the grant of a\nlicense or other regulatory or corporate\nconsent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock,\nthe Fund or other client accounts to suffer\ndisadvantages or business restrictions. If\ncertain aggregate ownership thresholds are\nreached either through the actions of\nBlackRock or the Fund or as a result of third-\nparty transactions, the ability of BlackRock,\non behalf of clients (including the Fund), to\npurchase or dispose of investments, or\nexercise rights or undertake business\ntransactions, may be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock,\non behalf of its clients (including the Fund),\nmay limit purchases, sell existing\ninvestments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or\nlimit the exercise of rights (including\ntransferring, outsourcing or limiting voting\nrights or forgoing the right to receive\ndividends) when BlackRock, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems it appropriate in light of\npotential regulatory or other restrictions on\nownership or other consequences resulting from\nreaching investment thresholds. In those\ncircumstances where ownership thresholds or\nlimitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks\nto allocate limited investment opportunities\nequitably among clients (including the Fund),\ntaking into consideration benchmark weight and\ninvestment strategy. BlackRock has adopted\ncertain controls designed to prevent the\noccurrence of a breach of any applicable\nownership threshold or limits, including, for\nexample, when ownership in certain securities\nnears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may\nremove such securities from the list of\nDeposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund\nin connection with purchases of Creation Units\nof such Fund and may limit purchases in such\nsecurities to the issuer's weighting in the\napplicable benchmark used by BlackRock to\nmanage such Fund. If client (including Fund)\nholdings of an issuer exceed an applicable\nthreshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain\nrelief to enable the continued holding of such\ninvestments, it may be necessary to sell down\nthese positions to meet the applicable\nlimitations. In these cases, benchmark\noverweight positions will be sold prior to\nbenchmark positions being reduced to meet\napplicable limitations.\n\n54\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, other ownership\nthresholds may trigger reporting requirements\nto governmental and regulatory authorities,\nand such reports may entail the disclosure of\nthe identity of a client or BlackRock\u2019s\nintended strategy with respect to such\nsecurity or asset. BlackRock may not serve as\nan Authorized Participant in the creation and\nredemption of iShares ETFs. In order to defray\ntransaction expenses and protect against\npossible shareholder dilution, the Fund may\ncollect certain fees from Authorized\nParticipants in connection with cash\nsubstitutions for creation and redemption\ntransactions. While BlackRock uses good faith\nestimates of the expected costs to the Fund in\ndetermining the rates for fees collected by\nthe Fund related to creation and redemption\nactivity, BlackRock may have incentives to\nimprove Fund performance through the\ncollection of these fees. As these charges are\nbased on estimates, where the charges exceed\nactual transaction- related costs and/or\nexpenses incurred by the Fund, Fund\nperformance could improve as a result.\nBlackRock has established processes to oversee\nthe determination of these estimates in an\neffort to mitigate this conflict. BlackRock\nmay maintain securities indices. To the extent\npermitted by applicable laws, the Fund may\nseek to license and use such indices as part\nof its investment strategy. Index based funds\nthat seek to track the performance of\nsecurities indices also may use the name of\nthe index or index provider in the fund name.\nIndex providers, including BlackRock (to the\nextent permitted by applicable law), may be\npaid licensing fees for use of their index or\nindex name. In instances where BlackRock\ncharges a unitary management fee, BlackRock\nmay have a financial incentive to use a\nBlackRock index that is less costly to\nBlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock\nmay benefit from the Fund using BlackRock\nindices by creating increasing acceptance in\nthe marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is\nnot obligated to license its indices to the\nFund and the Fund is under no obligation to\nuse BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters\ninto a license for a BlackRock index cannot be\nassured that the terms of any index licensing\nagreement with BlackRock will be as favorable\nas those terms offered to other licensees.\nBlackRock may enter into contractual\narrangements with third-party service\nproviders to the Fund ( e.g. , custodians,\nadministrators and index providers) pursuant\nto which BlackRock receives fee discounts or\nconcessions in recognition of BlackRock\u2019s\noverall relationship with such service\nproviders. BlackRock may also enter into\ncontractual arrangements with such service\nproviders pursuant to which BlackRock incurs\nadditional costs if the service provider\u2019s\nservices are terminated with respect to the\nFund. To the extent that BlackRock is\nresponsible for paying service providers out\nof its fees that it receives from the Fund,\nthe benefits of lower fees, including any fee\ndiscounts or concessions, or any additional\nsavings, may accrue, in whole or in part, to\nBlackRock, which could result in conflicts of\ninterest relating to the use or termination of\nservice providers to the Fund. In addition,\nconflicts of interest may arise with respect\nto contractual arrangements with third-party\nservice providers to the Fund, or the\nselection of such providers, particularly in\ncircumstances where BlackRock is negotiating\non behalf of both funds that have a unitary\nmanagement fee and those that do not or\ndifferent service providers have different fee\nstructures. Conflicts of interest may arise as\na result of simultaneous investment management\nof multiple client accounts by the BlackRock\u2019s\ninvestment professionals. For example,\ndifferences in the advisory fee structure may\ncreate the appearance of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest because such differences\ncould create pecuniary incentives for\nBlackRock to favor one client account over\nanother. BlackRock owns or has an ownership\ninterest in certain trading, portfolio\nmanagement, operations and/or information\nsystems used by Fund service providers. These\nsystems are, or will be, used by the Fund\nservice provider in connection with the\nprovision of services to accounts managed by\nBlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by\nBlackRock, including the Fund, that engage the\nservice provider (typically the custodian).\nThe Fund\u2019s service provider remunerates\nBlackRock for the use of the systems. The Fund\nservice provider\u2019s payments to BlackRock for\nthe use of these systems may enhance the\nprofitability of BlackRock. BlackRock\u2019s\nreceipt of fees from a service provider in\nconnection with the use of systems provided by\nBlackRock may create an incentive for\nBlackRock to recommend that the Fund enter\ninto or renew an arrangement with the service\nprovider. In recognition of a BlackRock\nclient\u2019s overall relationship with BlackRock,\nBlackRock may offer special pricing\narrangements for certain services provided by\nBlackRock. Any such special pricing\narrangements will not apply to the client\u2019s\ninvestment in the Fund. Present and future\nactivities of BlackRock (including BFA), its\ndirectors, officers and employees, in addition\nto those described in this section, may give\nrise to additional conflicts of interest.\n\n55\n\nInvestment Advisory, Administrative and\nDistribution Services Investment Adviser. BFA\nserves as investment adviser to the Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, and\nBFA. BFA is a California corporation\nindirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is\nregistered as an investment adviser under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nUnder the investment advisory agreement, BFA,\nsubject to the supervision of the Board and in\nconformity with the stated investment policies\nof the Fund, manages and administers the Trust\nand the investment of the Fund\u2019s assets. BFA\nis responsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the investment advisory agreement, BFA may,\nfrom time to time, in its sole discretion and\nto the extent permitted by applicable law,\nappoint one or more sub-advisers, including,\nwithout limitation, affiliates of BFA, to\nperform investment advisory or other services\nwith respect to the Fund. In addition, BFA may\ndelegate certain of its investment advisory\nfunctions under the investment advisory\nagreement to one or more of its affiliates to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. BFA\nmay terminate any or all sub-advisers or such\ndelegation arrangements in its sole discretion\nupon appropriate notice at any time to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. BFA is\nresponsible, under the investment advisory\nagreement, for substantially all expenses of\nthe Fund, including the cost of transfer\nagency, custody, fund administration, legal,\naudit and other services. BFA is not\nresponsible for, and the Fund will bear, the\nmanagement fees, interest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to the\nacquisition and disposition of portfolio\nsecurities and the execution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage commissions,\ndistribution fees or expenses, and litigation\nexpenses and any extraordinary expenses (as\ndetermined by a majority of the Independent\nTrustees).BFA may from time to time\nvoluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund\nFees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary\nwaiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by\nBFA at any time. For its investment advisory\nservices to the Fund, BFA is paid a management\nfee by the Fund, based on a percentage of the\nFund\u2019s average daily net assets, at an annual\nrate of 0.20%. BFA has contractually agreed to\nwaive a portion of its management fees in an\namount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and\nExpenses, if any, attributable to investments\nby the Fund in other registered investment\ncompanies advised by BFA, or its affiliates,\nthrough December 31, 2029. The contractual\nwaiver may be terminated prior to December 31,\n2029 only upon written agreement of the Trust\nand BFA. The investment advisory agreement\nwith respect to the Fund continues in effect\nfor two years from its effective date, and\nthereafter is subject to annual approval by\n(i) the Board, or (ii) the vote of a majority\nof the outstanding voting securities (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund, provided\nthat in either event such continuance also is\napproved by a majority of the Board members\nwho are not interested persons (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the Fund, by a vote cast in\nperson at a meeting called for the purpose of\nvoting on such approval. The investment\nadvisory agreement with respect to the Fund is\nterminable without penalty, on 60 days\u2019\nnotice, by the Board or by a vote of the\nholders of a majority of the Fund\u2019s\noutstanding voting securities (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act). The investment advisory\nagreement is also terminable upon 60 days\u2019\nnotice by BFA and will terminate automatically\nin the event of its assignment (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act). Portfolio Managers. As of July\n31, 2024, the individuals named as Portfolio\nManagers in the Fund's Prospectus were also\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of other iShares funds and certain\nother types of portfolios and/or accounts as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  Jennifer Hsui                               \n  Types of         Number       Total Assets  \n  Accounts                                    \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          349  $2,417,260,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment            0                N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts        0                N/A  \n                                              \n56\n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n  Types of         Number       Total Assets  \n  Accounts                                    \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          317  $2,383,128,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment           84      9,362,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts       11      2,789,000,000  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Paul Whitehead                              \n  Types of         Number       Total Assets  \n  Accounts                                    \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment          385  $2,555,342,000,0\u2026  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment          323  1,103,725,000,000  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other Accounts      134    737,653,000,000  \n                                              \nPursuant to BFA\u2019s policy, investment\nopportunities are allocated equitably among\nthe Fund and other portfolios and accounts.\nFor example, under certain circumstances, an\ninvestment opportunity may be restricted due\nto limited supply in the market, legal\nconstraints or other factors, in which event\nthe investment opportunity will be allocated\nequitably among those portfolios and accounts,\nincluding the Fund, seeking such investment\nopportunity. As a consequence, from time to\ntime the Fund may receive a smaller allocation\nof an investment opportunity than it would\nhave if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its\naffiliates did not manage other portfolios or\naccounts. Like the Fund, the other portfolios\nor accounts for which the Portfolio Managers\nare primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management generally pay an asset-\nbased fee to BFA or its affiliates, as\napplicable, for its advisory services. One or\nmore of those other portfolios or accounts,\nhowever, may pay BFA or its affiliates a\nperformance-based fee in lieu of, or in\naddition to, an asset-based fee for its\nadvisory services. A portfolio or account with\na performance-based fee would pay BFA or its\naffiliates a portion of that portfolio\u2019s or\naccount\u2019s gains, or would pay BFA or its\naffiliates more for its services than would\notherwise be the case if BFA or any of its\naffiliates meets or exceeds specified\nperformance targets. Performance-based fee\narrangements could present an incentive for\nBFA or its affiliates to devote greater\nresources, and allocate more investment\nopportunities, to the portfolios or accounts\nthat have those fee arrangements, relative to\nother portfolios or accounts, in order to earn\nlarger fees. Although BFA and each of its\naffiliates have an obligation to allocate\nresources and opportunities equitably among\nportfolios and accounts and intend to do so,\nshareholders of the Fund should be aware that,\nas with any group of portfolios and accounts\nmanaged by an investment adviser and/or its\naffiliates pursuant to varying fee\narrangements, including performance-based fee\narrangements, there is the potential for a\nconflict of interest, which may result in the\nPortfolio Managers favoring those portfolios\nor accounts with performance-based fee\narrangements. The tables below show, for each\nPortfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or\naccounts of the types set forth in the above\ntables and the aggregate of total assets in\nthose portfolios or accounts with respect to\nwhich the investment management fees are based\non the performance of those portfolios or\naccounts as of July 31, 2024:\n                                              \n  Jennifer                                    \n  Hsui                                        \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Greg Savage                                 \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith  Aggregateof    \n  Accounts        Performance  Total Assets   \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0  N/A            \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     0  N/A            \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \n57\n                                              \n  Paul                                        \n  Whitehead                                   \n                    Number of                 \n                        Other                 \n  Types of       Accountswith    Aggregateof  \n  Accounts        Performance   Total Assets  \n                  FeesManaged                 \n                 by Portfolio                 \n                      Manager                 \n  Registered                                  \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Companies                                   \n  Other Pooled                                \n  Investment                0            N/A  \n  Vehicles                                    \n  Other                     1  $3,129,000,0\u2026  \n  Accounts                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Manager Compensation Overview The\ndiscussion below describes the Portfolio\nManagers' compensation as of November 6, 2024.\nBlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with\nits portfolio managers, its competitive\ncompensation and its career path emphasis at\nall levels reflect the value senior management\nplaces on key resources. Compensation may\ninclude a variety of components and may vary\nfrom year to year based on a number of\nfactors. The principal components of\ncompensation include a base salary, a\nperformance-based discretionary bonus,\nparticipation in various benefits programs and\none or more of the incentive compensation\nprograms established by BlackRock, Inc. Each\nportfolio manager receives base compensation\nbased on their position with the firm, as well\nas retirement and other benefits offered to\nall BlackRock employees. Additionally, each\nportfolio manager receives discretionary\nincentive compensation, determined based on\nseveral components, including: the performance\nof BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the\nportfolio manager\u2019s group within BlackRock,\nthe performance of portfolios managed by the\nportfolio manager and the team relative to the\nportfolios\u2019 investment objectives (which in\nthe case of index ETFs would be how closely\nthe ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the\nindividual\u2019s performance and contribution to\nthe overall performance of these portfolios\nand BlackRock. Discretionary incentive\ncompensation is paid in cash up to a certain\nthreshold with the remaining portion\nrepresented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock\nawards. In some cases, additional deferred\nBlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to\ncertain key employees as part of a long-term\nincentive award to aid in retention, align\ninterests with long-term shareholders and\nmotivate performance. As of November 6, 2024,\nthe Portfolio Managers did not beneficially\nown shares of the Fund. Codes of Ethics. The\nTrust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted\ncodes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under\nthe 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit\npersonnel subject to the codes of ethics to\ninvest in securities, subject to certain\nlimitations, including securities that may be\npurchased or held by the Fund. Each code of\nethics is available by contacting BlackRock at\nthe telephone number on the back cover of the\nFund\u2019s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR\nDatabase on the SEC's Internet site at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, and copies may be\nobtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by\ne-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. Anti-Money\nLaundering Requirements. The Fund is subject\nto the USA PATRIOT Act (the \u201c Patriot Act \u201d ).\nThe Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use\nof the U.S. financial system in furtherance of\nmoney laundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Pursuant to requirements under the\nPatriot Act, the Fund may request information\nfrom Authorized Participants to enable it to\nform a reasonable belief that it knows the\ntrue identity of its Authorized Participants.\nThis information will be used to verify the\nidentity of Authorized Participants or, in\nsome cases, the status of financial\nprofessionals; it will be used only for\ncompliance with the requirements of the\nPatriot Act. The Fund reserves the right to\nreject purchase orders from persons who have\nnot submitted information sufficient to allow\nthe Fund to verify their identity. The Fund\nalso reserves the right to redeem any amounts\nin the Fund from persons whose identity it is\nunable to verify on a timely basis. It is the\nFund's policy to cooperate fully with\nappropriate regulators in any investigations\nconducted with respect to potential money\nlaundering, terrorism or other illicit\nactivities. Administrator, Custodian and\nTransfer Agent. State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany ( \u201c State Street \u201d ) serves as\nadministrator, custodian and transfer agent\nfor the Fund under the Master Services\nAgreement and related Service Schedule (the \u201c\nService Module \u201d ). State Street\u2019s principal\naddress is One Congress Street, Suite 1,\nBoston, MA 02114-2016. Pursuant to the Service\nModule for Fund Administration and Accounting\nServices with the Trust, State Street provides\nnecessary administrative, legal, tax and\naccounting and financial reporting services\nfor the maintenance and operations of the\nTrust and the Fund. In addition, State Street\nmakes available the office space, equipment,\npersonnel and facilities required to provide\nsuch services. Pursuant to the Service Module\nfor\n\n58\n\nCustodial Services with the Trust, State\nStreet maintains, in separate accounts, cash,\nsecurities and other assets of the Trust and\nthe Fund, keeps all necessary accounts and\nrecords and provides other services. State\nStreet is required, upon the order of the\nTrust, to deliver securities held by State\nStreet and to make payments for securities\npurchased by the Trust for the Fund. State\nStreet is authorized to appoint certain\nforeign custodians or foreign custody managers\nfor Fund investments outside the U.S. Pursuant\nto the Service Module for Transfer Agency\nServices with the Trust, State Street acts as\na transfer agent for the Fund\u2019s authorized and\nissued shares of beneficial interest, and as\ndividend disbursing agent of the Trust. As\ncompensation for these services, State Street\nreceives certain out-of-pocket costs,\ntransaction fees and asset-based fees which\nare accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA. BFA\npays the compensation because it has agreed to\npay these operating expenses under the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement as described\ntherein. JPMorgan serves as custodian for the\nFund in connection with certain securities\nlending activities under a Custody Services\nAgreement. JPMorgan\u2019s principal address is 383\nMadison Avenue, 11 th Floor, New York, NY\n10179. Pursuant to the Custody Services\nAgreement with BTC and the Trust, JPMorgan\nprovides custody and related services required\nto facilitate securities lending by the Fund.\nJPMorgan maintains custody as may be necessary\nto facilitate Fund securities lending activity\nin coordination with other funds, maintains\ncustodial records and provides other services.\nAs compensation for these services, JPMorgan\nreceives certain fees and expenses paid by BTC\nfrom its compensation for its services as\nsecurities lending agent. Distributor. The\nDistributor's principal address is 50 Hudson\nYards, New York, NY 10001. Shares are\ncontinuously offered for sale by the Fund\nthrough the Distributor or its agent only in\nCreation Units, as described in the Prospectus\nand below in the Creation and Redemption of\nCreation Units section of this SAI. Fund\nshares in amounts less than Creation Units are\ngenerally not distributed by the Distributor\nor its agent. The Distributor or its agent\nwill arrange for the delivery of the\nProspectus and, upon request, this SAI to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nor its agents and confirmations of acceptance\nfurnished by it or its agents. The Distributor\nis a broker-dealer registered under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the \u201c 1934 Act \u201d ), and a member of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.\n( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor is also\nlicensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S.\nstates, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands and the District of Columbia.\nThe Distribution Agreement for the Fund\nprovides that it may be terminated at any\ntime, without the payment of any penalty, on\nat least 60 days' prior written notice to the\nother party following (i) the vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii)\nthe vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the Fund. The Distribution Agreement will\nterminate automatically in the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act). The\nDistributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers\n\u201d ) who will solicit purchases of Creation\nUnits of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers\nmay also be Authorized Participants (as\ndescribed below), Depository Trust Company ( \u201c\nDTC \u201d ) participants and/or investor services\norganizations. BFA or its affiliates may, from\ntime to time and from its own resources, pay,\ndefray or absorb costs relating to\ndistribution, including payments out of its\nown resources to the Distributor, or to\notherwise promote the sale of shares.\nSecurities Lending. To the extent that the\nFund engages in securities lending, the Fund\nconducts its securities lending pursuant to\nSEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund, subject\nto the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to\na written agreement (the \u201c Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement \u201d ). The Fund retains a\nportion of the securities lending income and\nremits the remaining portion to BTC as\ncompensation for its services as securities\nlending agent. Securities lending income is\ngenerally equal to the total of income earned\nfrom the reinvestment of cash collateral (and\nexcludes collateral investment fees as defined\nbelow), and any fees or other payments to and\nfrom borrowers of securities. As securities\nlending agent, BTC bears all operational costs\ndirectly related to securities lending,\nincluding custodial costs of JPMorgan. The\nFund is responsible for fees in connection\nwith the investment of cash collateral\nreceived for securities on loan in a money\nmarket fund managed by BFA (the \u201c collateral\ninvestment fees \u201d ); however, BTC has agreed\nto reduce the amount of securities lending\nincome it receives in order to effectively\nlimit the collateral investment fees the Fund\nbears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money\nmarket fund shares will not be subject to a\nsales load, redemption fee, distribution fee\nor service fee. To the extent that the Fund\ninvests cash collateral in a non-government\nmoney market fund, the Fund may be subject to\na discretionary liquidity fee of up to 2% on\nall redemptions. Discretionary liquidity fees\nmay be imposed or terminated at any time at\nthe discretion of the board of directors of\nthe money market fund, or its delegate, if it\nis determined that such fee would be, or would\nnot be, respectively, in the best interest of\nthe money market fund. Additionally, the Fund\nwill be subject\n\n59\n\nto a mandatory liquidity fee if the money\nmarket fund\u2019s total net redemptions on a\nsingle day exceed 5% of the money market\nfund\u2019s net assets, unless the liquidity costs\nare de minimis ( i.e ., less than one basis\npoint (0.01%)). The money market fund will\ndetermine the size of the mandatory liquidity\nfee by making a good faith estimate of certain\ncosts the money market fund would incur if it\nwere to sell a pro rata amount of each\nsecurity in the portfolio to satisfy the\namount of net redemptions on that day. There\nis no limit to the size of a mandatory\nliquidity fee. If the money market fund cannot\nestimate the costs of selling a pro rata\namount of each portfolio security in good\nfaith and supported by data, it is required to\napply a default liquidity fee of 1% on the\nvalue of shares redeemed on that day. The\nimposition of any such discretionary or\nmandatory liquidity fee would reduce the\nFund\u2019s returns on securities lending. Under\nthe securities lending program, the Fund is\ncategorized into one of several specific asset\nclasses. The determination of the Fund\u2019s asset\nclass category (fixed-income, domestic equity,\ninternational equity or fund-of-funds), each\nof which may be subject to a different fee\narrangement, is based on a methodology agreed\nto by the Trust and BTC. Pursuant to the\ncurrent Securities Lending Agency Agreement:\n(i) international equity funds, such as the\nFund, retain 82% of securities lending income\n(which excludes collateral investment fees),\nand (ii) this amount can never be less than\n70% of the sum of securities lending income\nplus collateral investment fees. In addition,\ncommencing the business day following the date\nthat the aggregate securities lending income\n(which includes, for this purpose, collateral\ninvestment fees) earned across the iShares\nComplex (as defined in the Management \u2014\nTrustees and Officers section of this SAI) in\na calendar year exceeds a specified threshold,\neach applicable international equity fund,\npursuant to the current Securities Lending\nAgency Agreement, will receive for the\nremainder of that calendar year securities\nlending income as follows: (i) 85% of\nsecurities lending income (which excludes\ncollateral investment fees); and (ii) this\namount can never be less than 70% of the sum\nof securities lending income plus collateral\ninvestment fees. Because the Fund is newly\nlaunched, no services have been provided by\nBTC as the Fund\u2019s securities lending agent,\nand the Fund had no income and\nfees/compensation related to securities\nlending activities for the fiscal year ended\nAugust 31, 2024. Payments by BFA and its\nAffiliates. BFA and/or its affiliates ( \u201c BFA\nEntities \u201d ) may pay certain broker-dealers,\nregistered investment advisers, banks and\nother financial intermediaries ( \u201c\nIntermediaries \u201d ) for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, other iShares funds or\nexchange-traded products in general. BFA\nEntities make these payments from their own\nassets and not from the assets of the Fund.\nAlthough a portion of BFA Entities\u2019 revenue\ncomes directly or indirectly in part from fees\npaid by the Fund, other iShares funds\n(including, if applicable, any underlying\niShares funds held by a Fund) or exchange-\ntraded products, these payments do not\nincrease the price paid by investors for the\npurchase of shares of, or the cost of owning,\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. BFA Entities make payments\nfor Intermediaries\u2019 participation in\nactivities that are designed to make\nregistered representatives, other\nprofessionals and individual investors more\nknowledgeable about exchange-traded products,\nincluding the Fund and other iShares funds, or\nfor other activities, such as participation in\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems ( \u201c Education Costs \u201d ). BFA\nEntities also make payments to Intermediaries\nfor certain printing, publishing and mailing\ncosts or materials relating to the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products ( \u201c\nPublishing Costs \u201d ). In addition, BFA\nEntities make payments to Intermediaries that\nmake shares of the Fund, other iShares funds\nor exchange-traded products available to their\nclients, in some cases at a waived or reduced\ncommission rate or ticket charge, develop new\nproducts that feature iShares, create\neducational content about the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products that\nis featured on an Intermediary\u2019s platform, or\notherwise promote the Fund, other iShares\nfunds and exchange-traded products. BFA\nEntities may also reimburse expenses or make\npayments from their own assets to\nIntermediaries or other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat the BFA Entities believe may benefit the\niShares business or facilitate investment in\nthe Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-\ntraded products. Payments of the type\ndescribed above are sometimes referred to as\nrevenue-sharing payments. Payments to an\nIntermediary may be significant to the\nIntermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries\npay to your salesperson or other investment\nprofessional may also be significant for your\nsalesperson or other investment professional.\nBecause an Intermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it will\nrecommend or make available to its clients,\nwhat services to provide for various products,\nor what marketing content to make available to\nits clients based on payments it receives or\nis eligible to receive, such payments may\ncreate conflicts of interest between the\nIntermediary and its\n\n60\n\nclients. These financial incentives may cause\nthe Intermediary to recommend the Fund, other\niShares funds or exchange-traded products, or\notherwise promote the Fund, other iShares\nfunds or exchange-traded products over other\ninvestments. The same conflicts of interest\nand financial incentives exist with respect to\nyour salesperson or other investment\nprofessional if he or she receives similar\npayments from his or her Intermediary firm. In\naddition to the payments described above, BFA\nEntities have developed proprietary tools,\ncalculators and related interactive or digital\ncontent that is made available through the\nwww.BlackRock.com website at no additional\ncost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may\nconfigure these tools and calculators and\nlocalize the content for Intermediaries as\npart of its customary digital marketing\nsupport and promotion of the Fund, other\niShares funds, exchange-traded products and\nBlackRock mutual funds. As of March 1, 2013,\nBFA Entities have contractual arrangements to\nmake payments (in addition to payments for\nEducation Costs or Publishing Costs) to one\nIntermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC\n( \u201c FBS \u201d ). Effective June 4, 2016, this\nrelationship was expanded to include National\nFinancial Services, LLC ( \u201c NFS \u201d ), an\naffiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special,\nlong-term and significant arrangement (the \u201c\nMarketing Program \u201d ), FBS, NFS and certain of\ntheir affiliates (collectively \u201c Fidelity \u201d )\nhave agreed, among other things, to actively\npromote iShares funds to customers, investment\nprofessionals and other intermediaries and in\nadvertising campaigns as the preferred\nexchange-traded product, to offer certain\niShares funds in certain Fidelity platforms\nand investment programs, in some cases at a\nwaived or reduced commission rate or ticket\ncharge, and to provide marketing data to BFA\nEntities. BFA Entities have agreed to\nfacilitate the Marketing Program by, among\nother things, making certain payments to FBS\nand NFS for marketing and implementing certain\nbrokerage and investment programs. Upon\ntermination of the arrangement, the BFA\nEntities will make additional payments to FBS\nand/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,\nincluding the overall success of the Marketing\nProgram and the level of services provided by\nFBS and NFS during the wind-down period. In\naddition, BFA Entities may enter into other\ncontractual arrangements with Intermediaries\nand certain other third parties that the BFA\nEntities believe may benefit the iShares\nbusiness or facilitate investment in iShares\nfunds. Such agreements may include payments by\nBFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third\nparties for data collection and provision,\ntechnology support, platform enhancement, or\neducational content, co-marketing and cross-\npromotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to\nsuch arrangements may vary in any year and may\nbe different for different Intermediaries and\nthird parties. In certain cases, the payments\nto Intermediaries are subject to certain\nminimum payment levels or tiered payments. As\nof the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries\nand other third parties receiving one or more\ntypes of the contractual payments described\nabove include (in addition to FBS and NFS):\nAdvisor Credit Exchange, American Enterprise\nInvestment Services Inc., Avantax Investment\nServices, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets,\nLLC, BNY Mellon Performance & Risk Analytics,\nLLC, Cetera Financial Group, Inc., Charles\nSchwab & Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre\nAG, Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey\nWright and Associates, LLC, Dynasty Financial\nPartners LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC,\nEnvestnet Asset Management, Inc., eToro USA\nSecurities Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill\nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated,\nMorgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Northwestern\nMutual Investment Services, LLC, Orion\nPortfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public\nHoldings, Inc., Raymond James Financial\nServices, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Sanctuary\nWealth Group, LLC, Stash Investments LLC, TD\nAmeritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc.,\nWells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells\nFargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC. Any\nadditions, modifications, or deletions to\nIntermediaries and other third parties listed\nabove that have occurred since the date of\nthis SAI are not included in the list.\nFurther, BFA Entities make Education Costs and\nPublishing Costs payments to other\nIntermediaries that are not listed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities\nmay determine to make such payments based on\nany number of metrics. For example, BFA\nEntities may make payments at year-end or\nother intervals in a fixed amount, an amount\nbased upon an Intermediary\u2019s services at\ndefined levels or an amount based on the\nIntermediary\u2019s net sales of one or more\niShares funds in a year or other period, any\nof which arrangements may include an agreed-\nupon minimum or maximum payment, or any\ncombination of the foregoing. As of the date\nof this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments\npaid by BFA Entities in connection with the\nFund, iShares funds and exchange-traded\nproducts in general will be immaterial to BFA\nEntities in the aggregate for the next year.\nPlease contact your salesperson or other\ninvestment professional for more information\nregarding any such payments or financial\nincentives his or her Intermediary firm may\nreceive. Any payments made, or financial\nincentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an\nIntermediary may create the incentive for the\nIntermediary to encourage customers to buy\nshares of the Fund, other iShares funds or\nother exchange-traded products. The Fund may\nparticipate in certain market maker incentive\nprograms of a national securities exchange in\nwhich an affiliate of the Fund would pay a fee\nto the exchange used for the purpose of\nincentivizing one or more market makers in the\n\n61\n\nsecurities of the Fund to enhance the\nliquidity and quality of the secondary market\nof securities of the Fund. The fee would then\nbe credited by the exchange to one or more\nmarket makers that meet or exceed liquidity\nand market quality standards with respect to\nthe securities of the Fund. Each market maker\nincentive program is subject to approval from\nthe SEC. Any such fee payments made to an\nexchange will be made by an affiliate of the\nFund solely for the benefit of the Fund and\nwill not be paid from any Fund assets. Other\nfunds managed by BFA may also participate in\nsuch programs. Determination of Net Asset\nValue Valuation of Shares. The NAV for the\nFund is generally calculated as of the close\nof regular trading hours on the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) (normally 4:00 p.m.,\nEastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is\nopen. Valuation of assets held by the Fund is\nas follows: Equity Investments. Equity\nsecurities traded on a recognized securities\nexchange ( e.g. , NYSE), on separate trading\nboards of a securities exchange or through a\nmarket system that provides contemporaneous\ntransaction pricing information (each an \u201c\nExchange \u201d ) are valued using information\nobtained via independent pricing services,\ngenerally at the closing price or, if an\nExchange closing price is not available, the\nlast traded price on that Exchange prior to\nthe time as of which the assets or liabilities\nare valued. However, under certain\ncircumstances, other means of determining\ncurrent market value may be used. If an equity\nsecurity is traded on more than one Exchange,\nthe current market value of the security where\nit is primarily traded generally will be used.\nIn the event that there are no sales involving\nan equity security held by the Fund on a day\non which the Fund values such security, the\nprior day\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the\nsecurity, in which case such asset would be\ntreated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined\nbelow). Options, Futures, Swaps and Other\nDerivatives. Exchange-traded equity options\n(except those that are customized) for which\nmarket quotations are readily available are\nvalued at the mean of the last bid and ask\nprices as quoted on the Exchange or the board\nof trade on which such options are traded. In\nthe event that there is no mean price\navailable for an exchange traded equity option\nheld by the Fund on a day on which the Fund\nvalues such option, the last bid (long\npositions) or ask (short positions) price, if\navailable, will be used as the value of such\noption. If no bid or ask price is available on\na day on which the Fund values such option,\nthe prior day\u2019s price will be used, unless BFA\ndetermines that such prior day\u2019s price no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the option,\nin which case such option will be treated as a\nFair Value Asset (as defined below).\nCustomized exchange-traded equity options, as\nwell as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a\nmathematical model which may incorporate a\nnumber of market data factors. Financial\nfutures contracts and options thereon, which\nare traded on exchanges, are valued at their\nlast sale price or settle price as of the\nclose of such exchanges. Swap agreements and\nother derivatives are generally valued daily\nbased upon quotations from market makers or by\na pricing service in accordance with the\nValuation Procedures. Underlying Funds. Shares\nof underlying open-end funds (including money\nmarket funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of\nunderlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or\nother ETFs will be valued at their most recent\nclosing price. General Valuation Information.\nPrices obtained from independent third-party\npricing services, broker-dealers or market\nmakers to value the Fund\u2019s securities and\nother assets and liabilities are based on\ninformation available at the time the Fund\nvalues its assets and liabilities. In the\nevent that a pricing service quotation is\nrevised or updated subsequent to the day on\nwhich the Fund valued such security, the\nrevised pricing service quotation generally\nwill be applied prospectively. Such\ndetermination will be made considering\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding\nthe revision. The price the Fund could receive\nupon the sale of any particular portfolio\ninvestment may differ from the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the investment, particularly for\nassets that trade in thin or volatile markets\nor that are valued using a fair valuation\nmethodology or a price provided by an\nindependent pricing service. As a result, the\nprice received upon the sale of an investment\nmay be less than the value ascribed by the\nFund, and the Fund could realize a greater\nthan expected loss or lesser than expected\ngain upon the sale of the investment. The\nFund\u2019s ability to value its investment may\nalso be impacted by technological issues\nand/or errors by pricing services or other\nthird-party service providers. All cash,\nreceivables and current payables are carried\non the Fund\u2019s books at their fair value. In\nthe event that application of the methods of\nvaluation discussed above result in a price\nfor a security which is deemed not to be\nrepresentative of the fair market value of\nsuch security, the security will be valued by,\nunder the direction of or in accordance with a\nmethod approved by BFA, the Fund\u2019s valuation\ndesignee, as reflecting fair value. All other\nassets and\n\n62\n\nliabilities (including securities for which\nmarket quotations are not readily available)\nheld by the Fund (including restricted\nsecurities) are valued at fair value as\ndetermined in good faith by BFA pursuant to\nthe Valuation Procedures. Any assets and\nliabilities which are denominated in a foreign\ncurrency are translated into U.S. dollars at\nthe prevailing market rates. Use of fair value\nprices and certain current market valuations\ncould result in a difference between the\nprices used to calculate the Fund\u2019s NAV and\nthe prices used in the Underlying Index,\nwhich, in turn, could result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance and the\nperformance of the Underlying Index. Fair\nValue. When market quotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA to be\nunreliable, the Fund\u2019s investments are valued\nat fair value ( \u201c Fair Value Assets \u201d ). Fair\nValue Assets are valued by BFA in accordance\nwith the Valuation Procedures. Pursuant to\nRule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act,\nthe Board of Trustees has designated BFA as\nthe valuation designee for the respective\nFunds for which it serves as investment\nadviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a\nmarket quotation is not readily available or\nis unreliable if, among other things, a\nsecurity or other asset or liability does not\nhave a price source due to its complete lack\nof trading, if BFA believes a market quotation\nfrom a broker-dealer or other source is\nunreliable ( e.g. , where it varies\nsignificantly from a recent trade, or no\nlonger reflects the fair value of the security\nor other asset or liability subsequent to the\nmost recent market quotation), or where the\nsecurity or other asset or liability is only\nthinly traded or due to the occurrence of a\nsignificant event subsequent to the most\nrecent market quotation. For this purpose, a \u201c\nsignificant event \u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable business\njudgment, that an event has occurred after the\nclose of trading for an asset or liability but\nprior to or at the time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last exchange closing\nprice or closing market price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.\nOn any day the NYSE is open and a foreign\nmarket or the primary exchange on which a\nforeign asset or liability is traded is\nclosed, such asset or liability will be valued\nusing the prior day\u2019s price, provided that BFA\nis not aware of any significant event or other\ninformation that would cause such price to no\nlonger reflect the fair value of the asset or\nliability, in which case such asset or\nliability would be treated as a Fair Value\nAsset. For certain foreign assets, a third-\nparty vendor supplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the movement of\na proprietary multi-factor model after the\nrelevant foreign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing methodology is\ndesigned to correlate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S. markets\nfollowing the close of the local markets to\nthe prices that might have prevailed as of a\nFund\u2019s pricing time. BFA\u2019s Rule 2a-5 Committee\nis responsible for reviewing and approving\nmethodologies by investment type and\nsignificant inputs used in the fair valuation\nof Fund assets or liabilities. In addition,\nthe Fund\u2019s accounting agent assists BFA by\nperiodically endeavoring to confirm the prices\nit receives from all third-party pricing\nservices, index providers and broker-dealers\nand regularly evaluating the values assigned\nto the securities and other assets and\nliabilities of the Fund. The pricing of all\nFair Value Assets is subsequently reported to\nthe Board or a committee thereof. When\ndetermining the price for a Fair Value Asset,\nBFA will seek to determine the price that the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive from\nthe current sale of that asset or liability in\nan arm\u2019s-length transaction on the date on\nwhich the asset or liability is being valued,\nand does not seek to determine the price the\nFund might reasonably expect to receive for\nselling an asset or liability at a later time\nor if it holds the asset or liability to\nmaturity. Fair value determinations will be\nbased upon all available factors that BFA\ndeems relevant at the time of the\ndetermination, and may be based on analytical\nvalues determined by BFA using proprietary or\nthird-party valuation models. Fair value\nrepresents a good faith approximation of the\nvalue of an asset or liability. When\ndetermining the fair value of an investment,\none or more fair value methodologies may be\nused (depending on certain factors, including\nthe asset type). For example, the investment\nmay be initially priced based on the original\ncost of the investment or, alternatively,\nusing proprietary or third-party models that\nmay rely upon one or more unobservable inputs.\nPrices of actual, executed or historical\ntransactions in the relevant investment (or\ncomparable instruments) or, where appropriate,\nan appraisal by a third-party experienced in\nthe valuation of similar instruments, may also\nbe used as a basis for establishing the fair\nvalue of an investment. The fair value of one\nor more assets or liabilities may not, in\nretrospect, be the price at which those assets\nor liabilities could have been sold during the\nperiod in which the particular fair values\nwere used in determining the Fund\u2019s NAV. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s sale or redemption of its\nshares at NAV, at a time when a holding or\nholdings are valued at fair value, may have\nthe effect of diluting or increasing the\neconomic interest of existing shareholders.\n\n63\n\nThe Fund\u2019s annual audited financial\nstatements, which are prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America ( \u201c US GAAP \u201d\n), follow the requirements for valuation set\nforth in Financial Accounting Standards Board\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201c\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures \u201d ( \u201c\nASC 820 \u201d ), which defines and establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value under US\nGAAP and expands financial statement\ndisclosure requirements relating to fair value\nmeasurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other\naccounting rules applicable to funds and\nvarious assets in which they invest are\nevolving. Such changes may adversely affect\nthe Fund. For example, the evolution of rules\ngoverning the determination of the fair market\nvalue of assets or liabilities, to the extent\nsuch rules become more stringent, would tend\nto increase the cost and/or reduce the\navailability of third-party determinations of\nfair market value. This may in turn increase\nthe costs associated with selling assets or\naffect their liquidity due to the Fund\u2019s\ninability to obtain a third-party\ndetermination of fair market value. Brokerage\nTransactions Subject to policies established\nby the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for\nthe execution of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\ntransactions and the allocation of brokerage.\nBFA does not execute transactions through any\nparticular broker or dealer, but seeks to\nobtain the best net results for the Fund,\ntaking into account such factors as price\n(including the applicable brokerage commission\nor dealer spread), size of order, difficulty\nof execution, operational facilities of the\nfirm and the firm\u2019s risk and skill in\npositioning blocks of securities. While BFA\ngenerally seeks reasonable trade execution\ncosts, the Fund does not necessarily pay the\nlowest spread or commission available, and\npayment of the lowest commission or spread is\nnot necessarily consistent with obtaining the\nbest price and execution in particular\ntransactions. Subject to applicable legal\nrequirements, BFA may select a broker based\npartly upon brokerage or research services\nprovided to BFA and its clients, including the\nFund. In return for such services, BFA may\ncause the Fund to pay a higher commission than\nother brokers would charge if BFA determines\nin good faith that the commission is\nreasonable in relation to the services\nprovided. In selecting brokers or dealers to\nexecute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to\nobtain the best price and most favorable\nexecution for the Fund and may take into\naccount a variety of factors including: (i)\nthe size, nature and character of the security\nor instrument being traded and the markets in\nwhich it is purchased or sold; (ii) the\ndesired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of the expected commission rates and\nspreads currently available; (iv) the activity\nexisting and expected in the market for the\nparticular security or instrument, including\nany anticipated execution difficulties; (v)\nthe full range of brokerage services provided;\n(vi) the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s capital; (vii)\nthe quality of research and research services\nprovided; (viii) the reasonableness of the\ncommission, dealer spread or its equivalent\nfor the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA\u2019s\nknowledge of any actual or apparent\noperational problems of a broker or dealer.\nBrokers may also be selected because of their\nability to handle special or difficult\nexecutions, such as may be involved in large\nblock trades, thinly traded securities, or\nother circumstances. Section 28(e) of the 1934\nAct ( \u201c Section 28(e) \u201d ) permits a U.S.\ninvestment adviser, under certain\ncircumstances, to cause an account to pay a\nbroker or dealer a commission for effecting a\ntransaction in securities that exceeds the\namount another broker or dealer would have\ncharged for effecting the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value of brokerage and\nresearch services provided by that broker or\ndealer. This includes commissions paid on\nriskless principal transactions in securities\nunder certain conditions. From time to time,\nthe Fund may purchase new issues of securities\nin a fixed price offering. In these\nsituations, the broker may be a member of the\nselling group that will, in addition to\nselling securities, provide BFA with research\nservices. FINRA has adopted rules expressly\npermitting these types of arrangements under\ncertain circumstances. Generally, the broker\nwill provide research \u201c credits \u201d in these\nsituations at a rate that is higher than that\navailable for typical secondary market\ntransactions. These arrangements may not fall\nwithin the safe harbor of Section 28(e). The\nFund anticipates that brokerage transactions\ninvolving foreign equity securities generally\nwill be conducted primarily on the principal\nstock exchanges of the applicable country.\nForeign equity securities may be held by the\nFund in the form of depositary receipts, or\nother securities convertible into foreign\nequity securities. Depositary receipts may be\nlisted on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC\nmarkets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may\nbe. ADRs, like other securities traded in the\nU.S., will be subject to negotiated commission\nrates. OTC issues, including most fixed-income\nsecurities such as corporate debt and U.S.\nGovernment securities, are normally traded on\na \u201c net \u201d basis without a stated commission,\nthrough dealers acting for their own account\nand not as brokers. The\n\n64\n\nFund will primarily engage in transactions\nwith these dealers or deal directly with the\nissuer unless a better price or execution\ncould be obtained by using a broker. Prices\npaid to a dealer with respect to both foreign\nand domestic securities will generally include\na \u201c spread, \u201d which is the difference between\nthe prices at which the dealer is willing to\npurchase and sell the specific security at the\ntime, and includes the dealer\u2019s normal profit.\nUnder the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with\nthe Fund and persons who are affiliated with\nsuch affiliated persons are prohibited from\ndealing with the Fund as principal in the\npurchase and sale of securities unless a\npermissive order allowing such transactions is\nobtained from the SEC. Since transactions in\nthe OTC market usually involve transactions\nwith the dealers acting as principal for their\nown accounts, the Fund will not deal with\naffiliated persons and affiliated persons of\nsuch affiliated persons in connection with\nsuch transactions. The Fund will not purchase\nsecurities during the existence of any\nunderwriting or selling group relating to such\nsecurities of which BFA, BRIL or any\naffiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nthereof is a member except pursuant to\nprocedures adopted by the Board in accordance\nwith Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act. Purchases\nof money market instruments by the Fund are\nmade from dealers, underwriters and issuers.\nThe Fund does not currently expect to incur\nany brokerage commission expense on such\ntransactions because money market instruments\nare generally traded on a \u201c net \u201d basis with\ndealers acting as principal for their own\naccounts without a stated commission. The\nprice of the security, however, usually\nincludes a profit to the dealer. BFA may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act\nand SEC rules and regulations. Under these\nprovisions, any commissions paid to affiliated\nbrokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair\ncompared to the commissions charged by other\nbrokers or dealers in comparable transactions.\nSecurities purchased in underwritten offerings\ninclude a fixed amount of compensation to the\nunderwriter, generally referred to as the\nunderwriter\u2019s concession or discount. When\nsecurities are purchased or sold directly from\nor to an issuer, no commissions or discounts\nare paid. Investment decisions for the Fund\nand for other investment accounts managed by\nBFA and the other Affiliates are made\nindependently of each other in light of\ndiffering conditions. A variety of factors\nwill be considered in making investment\nallocations. These factors include: (i)\ninvestment objectives or strategies for\nparticular accounts, including sector,\nindustry, country or region and capitalization\nweightings; (ii) tax considerations of an\naccount; (iii) risk or investment\nconcentration parameters for an account; (iv)\nsupply or demand for a security at a given\nprice level; (v) size of available investment;\n(vi) cash availability and liquidity\nrequirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory\nrestrictions; (viii) minimum investment size\nof an account; (ix) relative size of account;\nand (x) such other factors as may be approved\nby BlackRock\u2019s general counsel. Moreover,\ninvestments may not be allocated to one client\naccount over another based on any of the\nfollowing considerations: (i) to favor one\nclient account at the expense of another; (ii)\nto generate higher fees paid by one client\naccount over another or to produce greater\nperformance compensation to BlackRock; (iii)\nto develop or enhance a relationship with a\nclient or prospective client; (iv) to\ncompensate a client for past services or\nbenefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce\nfuture services or benefits to be rendered to\nBlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize\ninvestment performance among different client\naccounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may\ndeal, trade and invest for their own\nrespective accounts in the types of securities\nin which the Fund may invest. Initial public\nofferings ( \u201c IPOs \u201d ) of securities may be\nover-subscribed and subsequently trade at a\npremium in the secondary market. When BFA is\ngiven an opportunity to invest in such an\ninitial offering or \u201c new \u201d or \u201c hot \u201d issue,\nthe supply of securities available for client\naccounts is often less than the amount of\nsecurities the accounts would otherwise take.\nIn order to allocate these investments fairly\nand equitably among client accounts over time,\neach portfolio manager or a member of his or\nher respective investment team will indicate\nto BFA\u2019s trading desk their level of interest\nin a particular offering with respect to\neligible clients\u2019 accounts for which that team\nis responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities\nwill be identified as eligible for particular\nclient accounts that are managed by portfolio\nteams who have indicated interest in the\noffering based on market capitalization of the\nissuer of the security and the investment\nmandate of the client account and in the case\nof international equity securities, the\ncountry where the offering is taking place and\nthe investment mandate of the client account.\nGenerally, shares received during the IPO will\nbe allocated among participating client\naccounts within each investment mandate on a\npro rata basis. This pro rata allocation may\nresult in the Fund receiving less of a\nparticular security than if pro-rating had not\noccurred. All allocations of securities will\nbe subject, where relevant, to share minimums\nestablished for accounts and compliance\nconstraints. In situations where supply is too\nlimited to be allocated among all accounts for\nwhich the\n\n65\n\ninvestment is eligible, portfolio managers may\nrotate such investment opportunities among one\nor more accounts so long as the rotation\nsystem provides for fair access for all client\naccounts over time. Other allocation\nmethodologies that are considered by BFA to be\nfair and equitable to clients may be used as\nwell. Because different accounts may have\ndiffering investment objectives and policies,\nBFA may buy and sell the same securities at\nthe same time for different clients based on\nthe particular investment objective,\nguidelines and strategies of those accounts.\nFor example, BFA may decide that it may be\nentirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell\na security at the same time a value fund is\nbuying that security. To the extent that\ntransactions on behalf of more than one client\nof BFA or the other Affiliates during the same\nperiod increase the demand for securities\nbeing purchased or the supply of securities\nbeing sold, there may be an adverse effect on\nprice. For example, sales of a security by\nBlackRock on behalf of one or more of its\nclients may decrease the market price of such\nsecurity, adversely impacting other BlackRock\nclients that still hold the security. If\npurchases or sales of securities arise for\nconsideration at or about the same time that\nwould involve the Fund or other clients or\nfunds for which BFA or another Affiliate act\nas investment manager, transactions in such\nsecurities will be made, insofar as feasible,\nfor the respective funds and clients in a\nmanner deemed equitable to all. In certain\ninstances, BFA may find it efficient for\npurposes of seeking to obtain best execution,\nto aggregate or \u201c bunch \u201d certain\ncontemporaneous purchases or sale orders of\nits advisory accounts and advisory accounts of\naffiliates. In general, all contemporaneous\ntrades for client accounts under management by\nthe same portfolio manager or investment team\nwill be bunched in a single order if the\ntrader believes the bunched trade would\nprovide each client with an opportunity to\nachieve a more favorable execution at a\npotentially lower execution cost. The costs\nassociated with a bunched order will be shared\npro rata among the clients in the bunched\norder. Generally, if an order for a particular\nportfolio manager or management team is filled\nat several different prices through multiple\ntrades, all accounts participating in the\norder will receive the average price (except\nin the case of certain international markets\nwhere average pricing is not permitted). While\nin some cases this practice could have a\ndetrimental effect upon the price or value of\nthe security as far as the Fund is concerned,\nin other cases it could be beneficial to the\nFund. Transactions effected by BFA or the\nother Affiliates on behalf of more than one of\nits clients during the same period may\nincrease the demand for securities being\npurchased or the supply of securities being\nsold, causing an adverse effect on price. The\ntrader will give the bunched order to the\nbroker-dealer that the trader has identified\nas being able to provide the best execution of\nthe order. Orders for purchase or sale of\nsecurities will be placed within a reasonable\namount of time of the order receipt and\nbunched orders will be kept bunched only long\nenough to execute the order. The Fund's\npurchase and sale orders for securities may be\ncombined with those of other investment\ncompanies, clients or accounts that BlackRock\nmanages or advises. If purchases or sales of\nportfolio securities of the Fund and one or\nmore other accounts managed or advised by\nBlackRock are considered at or about the same\ntime, transactions in such securities are\nallocated among the Fund and the other\naccounts in a manner deemed equitable to all\nby BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure\ncould have a detrimental effect on the price\nor volume of the security as far as the Fund\nis concerned. However, in other cases, it is\npossible that the ability to participate in\nvolume transactions and to negotiate lower\ntransaction costs will be beneficial to the\nFund. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for\nits own account in the types of securities in\nwhich the Fund may invest. BlackRock may, from\ntime to time, effect trades on behalf of and\nfor the account of the Fund with brokers or\ndealers that are affiliated with BFA, in\nconformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and\nregulations. Under these provisions, any\ncommissions paid to affiliated brokers or\ndealers must be reasonable and fair compared\nto the commissions charged by other brokers or\ndealers in comparable transactions. The Fund\nwill not deal with affiliates in principal\ntransactions unless permitted by applicable\nSEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive\norder. Portfolio turnover may vary from year\nto year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates may result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses. Because the Fund\nis newly launched, there is no reportable\nportfolio turnover. Creation or redemption\ntransactions, to the extent consisting of\ncash, may require the Fund to\ncontemporaneously transact with broker-dealers\nfor purchases of Deposit Securities (as\ndefined below under Fund Deposit ) or sales of\nFund Securities (as defined below under\nRedemption of Creation Units ), as applicable.\nSuch transactions with a particular broker-\ndealer may be conditioned upon the broker-\ndealer's agreement to transact at guaranteed\nprice levels in order to reduce transaction\ncosts the Fund would otherwise incur as a\nconsequence of settling creation or redemption\nbaskets in cash rather than in-kind. Following\nthe Fund\u2019s receipt of an order to purchase or\nredeem creation or redemption baskets, to the\nextent such purchases or redemptions consist\nof a cash portion, the Fund will enter an\norder with a broker or dealer to purchase or\nsell the Deposit Securities or Fund\nSecurities, as applicable. The terms of such\norder may, depending on the timing of the\ntransaction and certain other factors, require\nthe broker or dealer to guarantee that the\nFund will achieve execution of its order at a\nprice at\n\n66\n\nleast as favorable to the Fund as the Fund\u2019s\nvaluation of the Deposit Securities/Fund\nSecurities used for purposes of calculating\nthe NAV applied to the creation or redemption\ntransaction giving rise to the order (the \u201c\nExecution Performance Guarantee \u201d ). Such\norders may be placed with the purchasing or\nredeeming Authorized Participant (or a broker-\ndealer affiliated with the Authorized\nParticipant or a third-party broker-dealer\nengaged through the Authorized Participant) in\nits capacity as a broker-dealer. The amount\npayable to the Fund in respect of any\nExecution Performance Guarantee will depend on\nthe results achieved by the executing firm and\nwill vary depending on market activity, timing\nand a variety of other factors. The Execution\nPerformance Guarantee will apply for any\norders executed by the Authorized Participant\n(or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-\ndealer), even if the trades have not settled\nbefore the redemption transaction settles. To\nensure that an Execution Performance Guarantee\nwill be honored on orders arising from\ncreation transactions executed by an\nAuthorized Participant (or an affiliated or\nunaffiliated broker-dealer), an Authorized\nParticipant is required to deposit an amount\nwith the Fund (the \u201c Execution Performance\nDeposit \u201d ). If the broker-dealer executing\nthe order achieves executions in market\ntransactions at a price more favorable than\nthe Fund\u2019s valuation of the Deposit\nSecurities, then the Authorized Participant\ngenerally may retain the benefit of the\nfavorable executions, and the Fund will return\nto the Authorized Participant the Execution\nPerformance Deposit. If, however, the broker-\ndealer executing the order is unable to\nachieve executions in market transactions at a\nprice at least equal to the Fund\u2019s valuation\nof the securities, the Fund retains the\nportion of the Execution Performance Deposit\nequal to the full amount of the execution\nshortfall (including any taxes, brokerage\ncommissions or other costs) and may require\nthe Authorized Participant to deposit any\nadditional amount required to cover the full\namount of the actual Execution Performance\nGuarantee. To ensure that an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee will be honored for\nbrokerage orders arising from redemption\ntransactions executed by an Authorized\nParticipant (or an affiliated or unaffiliated\nbroker-dealer) as broker-dealer, an Authorized\nParticipant agrees to pay the shortfall amount\n(the \u201c Execution Performance Offset \u201d ). If\nthe broker-dealer executing the order achieves\nexecutions in market transactions at a price\nmore favorable than the Fund\u2019s valuation of\nthe Fund Securities, then the Authorized\nParticipant generally may retain the benefit\nof the favorable executions and the Authorized\nParticipant is not called upon to honor the\nExecution Performance Offset. If, however, the\nbroker-dealer is unable to achieve executions\nin market transactions at a price at least\nequal to the Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nsecurities, the Fund will be entitled to the\nportion of the Execution Performance Offset\nequal to the full amount of the execution\nshortfall (including any taxes, brokerage\ncommissions or other costs). The circumstances\nunder which the Execution Performance\nGuarantee will be used and the expected amount\nof any Execution Performance Deposit or\nExecution Performance Offset for the Fund will\nbe disclosed in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time based on the actual experience of\nthe Fund. Additional Information Concerning\nthe Trust Shares. The Trust issues shares of\nbeneficial interests in the funds with no par\nvalue. The Board may designate additional\niShares funds. Each share issued by a fund has\na pro rata interest in the assets of that\nfund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange,\nsubscription or conversion rights and are\nfreely transferable. Each share is entitled to\nparticipate equally in dividends and\ndistributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the relevant fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of such fund on\nliquidation. Each share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which the shareholder\nis entitled to vote. In any matter submitted\nto shareholders for a vote, each fund shall\nhold a separate vote, provided that\nshareholders of all affected funds will vote\ntogether when: (i) required by the 1940 Act,\nor (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter\naffects the interests of more than one fund.\nUnder Delaware law, the Trust is not required\nto hold an annual meeting of shareholders\nunless required to do so under the 1940 Act.\nThe policy of the Trust is not to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. All shares\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights in the election of members of\nthe Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the\nTrust may be removed by vote of the\nshareholders.\n\n67\n\nFollowing the creation of the initial Creation\nUnit(s) of shares of a fund and immediately\nprior to the commencement of trading in such\nfund\u2019s shares, a holder of shares may be a \u201c\ncontrol person \u201d of the fund, as defined in\nRule 0-1 under the 1940 Act. A fund cannot\npredict the length of time for which one or\nmore shareholders may remain a control person\nof the fund. Shareholders may make inquiries\nby writing to iShares Trust, c/o BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive,\nPrinceton, NJ 08540. Absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of\nthe shares of a fund may be subject to the\nreporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934\nAct and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. In addition, absent an applicable\nexemption or other relief from the SEC or its\nstaff, officers and trustees of a fund and\nbeneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a\nfund ( \u201c Insiders \u201d ) may be subject to the\ninsider reporting, short-swing profit and\nshort sale provisions of Section 16 of the\n1934 Act and the SEC\u2019s rules promulgated\nthereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders\nshould consult with their own legal counsel\nconcerning their obligations under Sections 13\nand 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance\nprovided by the SEC staff. In accordance with\nthe Trust's current Agreement and Declaration\nof Trust (the \u201c Declaration of Trust \u201d ), the\nBoard may, without shareholder approval\n(unless such shareholder approval is required\nby the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,\nincluding the 1940 Act), authorize certain\nfunds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell\nall or substantially all of their assets, or\ntake other similar actions with, to or into\nanother fund. The Trust or a fund may be\nterminated by a majority vote of the Board,\nsubject to the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the shareholders of the Trust or such fund\nentitled to vote on termination; however, in\ncertain circumstances described in the\nDeclaration of Trust, only a majority vote of\nthe Board is required. Although the shares are\nnot automatically redeemable upon the\noccurrence of any specific event, the\nDeclaration of Trust provides that the Board\nwill have the unrestricted power to alter the\nnumber of shares in a Creation Unit.\nTherefore, in the event of a termination of\nthe Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole\ndiscretion, could determine to permit the\nshares to be redeemable in aggregations\nsmaller than Creation Units or to be\nindividually redeemable. In such circumstance,\nthe Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-\nkind, for cash or for a combination of cash or\nsecurities. Further, in the event of a\ntermination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust\nor a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions\nto all shareholders, with an in-kind election\nfor shareholders owning in excess of a certain\nstated minimum amount. DTC as Securities\nDepository for Shares of the Fund. Shares of\nthe Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. DTC\nwas created in 1973 to enable electronic\nmovement of securities between its\nparticipants ( \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ), and\nNSCC was established in 1976 to provide a\nsingle settlement system for securities\nclearing and to serve as central counterparty\nfor securities trades among DTC Participants.\nIn 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\n\u201c DTCC \u201d ) and became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC\nis owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and\nFINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred\nshares in DTCC that provide them with the\nright to elect one member each to the DTCC\nboard of directors. Access to the DTC system\nis available to entities, such as banks,\nbrokers, dealers and trust companies, that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly ( \u201c Indirect\nParticipants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of\nshares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only\nthrough, records maintained by DTC (with\nrespect to DTC Participants) and on the\nrecords of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of shares. The laws of some\njurisdictions may require that certain\npurchasers of securities take physical\ndelivery of such securities in definitive\nform. Such laws may impair the ability of\ncertain investors to acquire beneficial\ninterests in shares of the Fund. Conveyance of\nall notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the shares of the\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust\nshall inquire of each such DTC Participant as\nto the number of Beneficial Owners holding\nshares, directly or indirectly, through such\nDTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each\nsuch DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may reasonably request, in\norder that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In\n\n68\n\naddition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC\nParticipant a fair and reasonable amount as\nreimbursement for the expenses attendant to\nsuch transmittal, all subject to applicable\nstatutory and regulatory requirements. Share\ndistributions shall be made to DTC or its\nnominee, Cede & Co., as the registered holder\nof all shares of the Trust. DTC or its\nnominee, upon receipt of any such\ndistributions, shall credit immediately DTC\nParticipants\u2019 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC Participants to Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners of shares\nheld through such DTC Participants will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is now the case with\nsecurities held for the accounts of customers\nin bearer form or registered in a \u201c street\nname, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such\nDTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspect of\nthe records relating to or notices to\nBeneficial Owners, or payments made on account\nof beneficial ownership interests in such\nshares, or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing any records relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother aspect of the relationship between DTC\nand the DTC Participants or the relationship\nbetween such DTC Participants and the Indirect\nParticipants and Beneficial Owners owning\nthrough such DTC Participants. DTC may decide\nto discontinue providing its service with\nrespect to shares of the Trust at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action to\nfind a replacement for DTC to perform its\nfunctions at a comparable cost. Distribution\nof Shares. In connection with the Fund's\nlaunch, the Fund will be seeded through the\nsale of one or more Creation Units by the Fund\nto one or more initial investors. Initial\ninvestors participating in the seeding may be\nAuthorized Participants, a lead market maker\nor other third party investor or an affiliate\nof the Fund or the Fund\u2019s adviser. Each such\ninitial investor may sell some or all of the\nshares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by\nthem pursuant to the registration statement\nfor the Fund (each, a \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d\n), which shares have been registered to permit\nthe resale from time to time after purchase.\nThe Fund will not receive any of the proceeds\nfrom the resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese shares. Selling Shareholders may sell\nshares owned by them directly or through\nbroker-dealers, in accordance with applicable\nlaw, on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, through trading systems, in\nthe OTC market or in transactions other than\non these exchanges or systems at fixed prices,\nat prevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected through brokerage\ntransactions, privately negotiated trades,\nblock sales, entry into options or other\nderivatives transactions or through any other\nmeans authorized by applicable law. Selling\nShareholders may redeem the shares held in\nCreation Unit size by them through an\nAuthorized Participant. Any Selling\nShareholder and any broker-dealer or agents\nparticipating in the distribution of shares\nmay be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933\nAct, in connection with such sales. Any\nSelling Shareholder and any other person\nparticipating in such distribution will be\nsubject to applicable provisions of the 1934\nAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCreation and Redemption of Creation Units\nGeneral. The Trust issues and sells shares of\nthe Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Distributor or\nits agent, without a sales load, at a price\nbased on the Fund's NAV next determined after\nreceipt, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), of an order received by the\nDistributor or its agent in proper form. On\ndays when the Listing Exchange closes earlier\nthan normal, the Fund may require orders to be\nplaced earlier in the day. The following table\nsets forth the number of shares of the Fund\nthat constitute a Creation Unit for the Fund\nand the approximate value of such Creation\nUnit as of November 6, 2024:\n                                              \n  Shares PerCreation        ApproximateValue  \n  Unit                       PerCreationUnit  \n                                     (U.S.$)  \n  100,000                         $2,500,000  \n                                              \n69\n\nIn its discretion, the Trust reserves the\nright to increase or decrease the number of\nthe Fund\u2019s shares that constitute a Creation\nUnit. The Board reserves the right to declare\na split or a consolidation in the number of\nshares outstanding of the Fund, and to make a\ncorresponding change in the number of shares\nconstituting a Creation Unit, in the event\nthat the per share price in the secondary\nmarket rises (or declines) to an amount that\nfalls outside the range deemed desirable by\nthe Board. A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to\nthe Fund is any day the Fund is open for\nbusiness, including any day when it satisfies\nredemption requests as required by Section\n22(e) of the 1940 Act. The Fund is open for\nbusiness any day on which the Listing Exchange\non which the Fund is listed for trading is\nopen for business. As of the date of this SAI,\nthe Listing Exchange observes the following\nholidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good\nFriday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence\nDay, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. Fund Deposit. The consideration for\npurchase of Creation Units of the Fund\ngenerally consists of Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component computed as described\nbelow. Together, the Deposit Securities and\nthe Cash Component constitute the \u201c Fund\nDeposit, \u201d which, when combined with the\nFund\u2019s portfolio securities is designed to\ngenerate performance that has a collective\ninvestment profile similar to that of the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents\nthe minimum initial and subsequent investment\namount for a Creation Unit of the Fund. Such\nFund Deposit is applicable, subject to any\nadjustments as described below, to purchases\nof Creation Units of shares of the Fund until\nsuch time as the next-announced Fund Deposit\nis made available. The \u201c Cash Component \u201d is\nan amount equal to the difference between the\nNAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the\n\u201c Deposit Amount, \u201d which is an amount equal\nto the market value of the Deposit Securities,\nand serves to compensate for any differences\nbetween the NAV per Creation Unit and the\nDeposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities are the sole responsibility\nof the Authorized Participant purchasing the\nCreation Unit. The Fund generally offers\nCreation Units partially for cash, but may, in\ncertain circumstances, offer Creation Units\nsolely for cash or solely in-kind. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit\nSecurities change pursuant to changes in the\ncomposition of the Fund's portfolio and as\nrebalancing adjustments and corporate action\nevents are reflected from time to time by BFA\nwith a view to the investment objective of the\nFund. The composition of the Deposit\nSecurities may also change in response to\nadjustments to the weighting or composition of\nthe component securities constituting the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund Deposit may also be\nmodified to minimize the Cash Component by\nredistributing the cash to the Deposit\nSecurities portion of the Fund Deposit through\n\u201c systematic rounding. \u201d The rounding\nmethodology \u201c rounds up \u201d position sizes of\nsecurities in the Deposit Securities (which in\nturn reduces the cash portion). However, the\nmethodology limits the maximum allowed\npercentage change in weight and share quantity\nof any given security in the Fund Deposit.\nFund Deposits may also be modified to position\na fund towards a forward index rebalance to\nreflect revisions that account for index\nadditions, deletions, and re-weights. The\nTrust may, in its sole discretion, substitute\na \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the\nCash Component to replace any Deposit Security\nin certain circumstances, including: (i) when\ninstruments are not available in sufficient\nquantity for delivery; (ii) when instruments\nare not eligible for transfer through DTC or\nthe clearing process (as discussed below);\n(iii) when instruments that the Authorized\nParticipant (or an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) are not\nable to be traded due to a trading\nrestriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant (or by\nan investor on whose behalf the Authorized\nParticipant is acting) would be restricted\nunder applicable securities or other local\nlaws; (v) in connection with distribution\npayments to be made by the Fund; or (vi) in\ncertain other situations. Cash Purchase\nMethod. Although the Trust does not generally\npermit full cash purchases of Creation Units\nof its funds, when partial or full cash\npurchases of Creation Units are available or\nspecified (Creation Units of the Fund are\ngenerally offered partially for cash), they\nwill be effected in essentially the same\nmanner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the\ncase of a partial or full cash purchase, the\nAuthorized Participant must pay the cash\nequivalent of the Deposit Securities it would\notherwise be required to provide through an\nin-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component\nrequired to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.\nThe Authorized Participant will also be\nrequired to pay certain transaction fees and\ncharges for cash purchases, as described\nbelow, and, if transacting as broker with the\nFund, may be required to cover certain\nbrokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution\nand price movement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\n\n70\n\nProcedures for Creation of Creation Units. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the\nDistributor and to create a Creation Unit of\nthe Fund, an entity must be: (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party, \u201d i.e ., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have\nexecuted an agreement with the Distributor,\nwith respect to creations and redemptions of\nCreation Units ( \u201c Authorized Participant\nAgreement \u201d ) (discussed below). A member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units is referred to as an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant. \u201d All shares of the\nFund, however created, will be entered on the\nrecords of DTC in the name of Cede & Co. for\nthe account of a DTC Participant. Role of the\nAuthorized Participant. Creation Units may be\npurchased only by or through a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency registered\nwith the SEC, which has a written agreement\nwith the Fund or one of its service providers\nthat allows such member or participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units (an \u201c Authorized Participant\n\u201d ). Such Authorized Participant will agree,\npursuant to the terms of such Authorized\nParticipant Agreement and on behalf of itself\nor any investor on whose behalf it will act,\nto certain conditions, including that such\nAuthorized Participant will make available in\nadvance of each purchase of shares an amount\nof cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component,\nonce the NAV of a Creation Unit is next\ndetermined after receipt of the purchase order\nin proper form, together with the transaction\nfees described below. An Authorized\nParticipant, acting on behalf of an investor,\nmay require the investor to enter into an\nagreement with such Authorized Participant\nwith respect to certain matters, including\npayment of the Cash Component. Investors who\nare not Authorized Participants must make\nappropriate arrangements with an Authorized\nParticipant. Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not be a DTC\nParticipant or may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that\norders to purchase Creation Units may have to\nbe placed by the investor's broker through an\nAuthorized Participant. As a result, purchase\norders placed through an Authorized\nParticipant may result in additional charges\nto such investor. The Trust does not expect to\nenter into an Authorized Participant Agreement\nwith more than a small number of DTC\nParticipants. A list of current Authorized\nParticipants may be obtained from the\nDistributor. The Distributor has adopted\nguidelines regarding Authorized Participants\u2019\ntransactions in Creation Units that are made\navailable to all Authorized Participants.\nThese guidelines set forth the processes and\nstandards for Authorized Participants to\ntransact with the Distributor and its agents\nin connection with creation and redemption\ntransactions. In addition, the Distributor may\nbe appointed as the proxy of the Authorized\nParticipant and may be granted a power of\nattorney under its Authorized Participant\nAgreement. Purchase Orders. To initiate an\norder for a Creation Unit, an Authorized\nParticipant must submit to the Distributor or\nits agent an irrevocable order to purchase\nshares of the Fund, in proper form, generally\nbefore 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business\nDay to receive that day\u2019s NAV. The Distributor\nor its agent will notify BFA and the custodian\nof such order. The custodian will then provide\nsuch information to any appropriate sub-\ncustodian. Procedures and requirements\ngoverning the delivery of the Fund Deposit are\nset forth in the procedures handbook for\nAuthorized Participants and may change from\ntime to time. Investors, other than Authorized\nParticipants, are responsible for making\narrangements for a creation request to be made\nthrough an Authorized Participant. The\nDistributor or its agent will provide a list\nof current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. Those placing orders to purchase\nCreation Units through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nto the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff\nTime (as defined below) on such Business Day.\nThe Authorized Participant must also make\navailable on or before the contractual\nsettlement date, by means satisfactory to the\nFund, immediately available or same day funds\nestimated by the Fund to be sufficient to pay\nthe Cash Component next determined after\nacceptance of the purchase order, together\nwith the applicable purchase transaction fees.\nThose placing orders should ascertain the\ndeadline for cash transfers by contacting the\noperations department of the broker or\ndepositary institution effectuating the\ntransfer of the Cash Component. This deadline\nis likely to be significantly earlier than the\nCutoff Time of the Fund. Investors should be\naware that an Authorized Participant may\nrequire orders for purchases of shares placed\nwith it to be in the particular form required\nby the individual Authorized Participant. The\nAuthorized Participant is responsible for any\nand all expenses and costs incurred by the\nFund, including any applicable cash amounts,\nin connection with any purchase order. Timing\nof Submission of Purchase Orders. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable order to purchase shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. Creation Orders must be transmitted\nby an Authorized Participant in the form\nrequired by the Fund to the Distributor or its\nagent pursuant to\n\n71\n\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement. Economic or market\ndisruptions or changes, or telephone or other\ncommunication failure, may impede the ability\nto reach the Distributor or its agent or an\nAuthorized Participant. Orders to create\nshares of the Fund that are submitted on the\nBusiness Day immediately preceding a holiday\nor a day (other than a weekend) when the\nequity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market\nare closed may not be accepted. The Fund's\ndeadline specified above for the submission of\npurchase orders is referred to as the Fund's \u201c\nCutoff Time. \u201d The Distributor or its agent,\nin their discretion, may permit the submission\nof such orders and requests by or through an\nAuthorized Participant at any time (including\non days on which the Listing Exchange is not\nopen for business) via communication through\nthe facilities of the Distributor's or its\nagent's proprietary website maintained for\nthis purpose. Purchase orders and redemption\nrequests, if accepted by the Trust, will be\nprocessed based on the NAV next determined\nafter such acceptance in accordance with the\nFund's Cutoff Times as provided in the\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and disclosed\nin this SAI. Acceptance of Orders for Creation\nUnits. Subject to the conditions that (i) an\nirrevocable purchase order has been submitted\nby the Authorized Participant (either on its\nown or another investor's behalf) and (ii)\narrangements satisfactory to the Fund are in\nplace for payment of the Cash Component and\nany other cash amounts which may be due, the\nFund will accept the order, subject to the\nFund's right (and the right of the Distributor\nand BFA) to reject any order until acceptance,\nas set forth below. Once the Fund has accepted\nan order, upon the next determination of the\nNAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the\nissuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt\nof payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or\nits agent will then transmit a confirmation of\nacceptance to the Authorized Participant that\nplaced the order. The Fund reserves the right\nto reject or revoke a creation order\ntransmitted to it by the Distributor or its\nagent provided that a rejection or revocation\nof a creation order does not violate Rule\n6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For\nexample, the Fund may reject or revoke a\ncreation order transmitted to it by the\nDistributor or its agent if (i) the order is\nnot in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding shares of\nthe Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not conform to the identity and\nnumber of shares specified, as described\nabove; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit\nSecurities is not legally required or would,\nin the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; or (v)\ncircumstances outside the control of the Fund,\nthe Distributor or its agent and BFA make it\nimpracticable to process purchase orders. The\nDistributor or its agent shall notify a\nprospective purchaser of a Creation Unit\nand/or the Authorized Participant acting on\nbehalf of such purchaser of its rejection of\nsuch order. The Fund, State Street, the sub-\ncustodian and the Distributor or its agent are\nunder no duty, however, to give notification\nof any defects or irregularities in the\ndelivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of\nthem incur any liability for failure to give\nsuch notification. Issuance of a Creation\nUnit. Except as provided herein, a Creation\nUnit will not be issued until the transfer of\ngood title to the Fund of the Deposit\nSecurities and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the sub-\ncustodian has confirmed to the custodian that\nthe securities included in the Fund Deposit\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant sub-\ncustodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor\nor its agent and BFA shall be notified of such\ndelivery and the Fund will issue and cause the\ndelivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units\nare generally issued on a \u201c T+2 basis \u201d ( i.e.\n, two Business Days after trade date).\nHowever, the Fund reserves the right to settle\nCreation Unit transactions on a basis other\nthan T+2, including a shorter settlement\nperiod, if necessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. For example, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle Creation Unit transactions on a\nbasis other than T+2 in order to accommodate\nnon-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account\nfor different treatment among non-U.S. and\nU.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-\ndividend dates ( i.e. , the last day the\nholder of a security can sell the security and\nstill receive dividends payable on the\nsecurity) and in certain other circumstances.\nTo the extent contemplated by an Authorized\nParticipant Agreement with the Distributor,\nthe Fund will issue Creation Units to such\nAuthorized Participant, notwithstanding the\nfact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have\nnot been received in part or in whole, in\nreliance on the undertaking of the Authorized\nParticipant to deliver the missing Deposit\nSecurities as soon as possible, which\nundertaking shall be secured by such\nAuthorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. The\nTrust may use such collateral at any time to\nbuy Deposit Securities for the Fund. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe contractual settlement date. Information\nconcerning the Fund's current procedures for\ncollateralization of missing Deposit\nSecurities is available from the Distributor\nor its agent. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement will permit the Fund to buy the\nmissing Deposit Securities at any time and\nwill subject the Authorized Participant to\nliability for any shortfall between the cost\nto the Fund of purchasing such securities and\nthe collateral including, without limitation,\nliability for related brokerage, borrowings\nand other charges.\n\n72\n\nIn certain cases, Authorized Participants may\ncreate and redeem Creation Units on the same\ntrade date and in these instances, the Fund\nreserves the right to settle these\ntransactions on a net basis or require a\nrepresentation from the Authorized\nParticipants that the creation and redemption\ntransactions are for separate beneficial\nowners. All questions as to the number of\nshares of each security in the Deposit\nSecurities and the validity, form, eligibility\nand acceptance for deposit of any securities\nto be delivered shall be determined by the\nFund and the Fund's determination shall be\nfinal and binding. Costs Associated with\nCreation Transactions. A standard creation\ntransaction fee is imposed to offset the\ntransfer, processing and other transaction\ncosts associated with the issuance of Creation\nUnits. The standard creation transaction fee\nis charged on each Creation Unit created by an\nAuthorized Participant on the day of the\ntransaction. The standard creation transaction\nfee is generally fixed at the amount shown in\nthe table below regardless of the number of\nCreation Units being purchased, but may be\nreduced by the Fund if transfer and processing\nexpenses associated with the creation are\nanticipated to be lower than the stated fee.\nIn order to defray transaction expenses for\nthe Fund and protect against possible\nshareholder dilution, if a creation\ntransaction consists solely or partially of\ncash, the Authorized Participant may also be\nrequired to cover (up to the maximum amount\nshown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign\nexchange, execution and other costs and\nexpenses related to the execution of trades\nresulting from such transaction (which may, in\ncertain instances, be based on a good faith\nestimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread between the expected bid\nand offer side of the market and anticipated\nmarket impact). However, the Fund is not\nobligated to trade identical securities to the\nsecurities identified by BlackRock in\nestimating these transaction and other costs\nand expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or\nan affiliate may determine in its discretion\nto deviate from the regular charge, subject to\nthe maximum amounts shown below. Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Deposit Securities to the\nFund. Certain fees/costs associated with\ncreation transactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\nacquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for\nsuch services. The following table sets forth\nthe Fund's standard creation transaction fees\nand maximum additional charge (as described\nabove):\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  CreationTransaction   AdditionalCharge*     \n  Fee                                         \n  $1,800                7.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit. If a purchase consists of a\ncash portion and the Fund places a brokerage\ntransaction to purchase portfolio securities\nwith the Authorized Participant (or an\naffiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer), the\nAuthorized Participant may be required, in its\ncapacity as broker-dealer with respect to that\ntransaction, to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution, and price\nmovement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nRedemption of Creation Units. Shares of the\nFund may be redeemed by Authorized\nParticipants only in Creation Units at their\nNAV next determined after receipt of a\nredemption request in proper form by the\nDistributor or its agent and only on a\nBusiness Day. The Fund will not redeem shares\nin amounts less than Creation Units. There can\nbe no assurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the secondary market\nat any time to permit assembly of a Creation\nUnit. Investors should expect to incur\nbrokerage and other costs in connection with\nassembling a sufficient number of shares to\nconstitute a Creation Unit that could be\nredeemed by an Authorized Participant.\nBeneficial owners also may sell shares in the\nsecondary market. The Fund generally redeems\nCreation Units partially for cash. However,\nthe Fund reserves the right to distribute\nsecurities and other portfolio instruments in-\nkind as payment for Creation Units being\nredeemed. Please see the Cash Redemption\nMethod section below and the following\ndiscussion summarizing the in-kind method for\nfurther information on redeeming Creation\nUnits of the Fund.\n\n73\n\nThe Fund publishes the designated portfolio of\nsecurities (including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be substituted)\nthat will be applicable to redemption requests\nreceived in proper form (as defined below) on\nthat day ( \u201c Fund Securities \u201d or \u201c Redemption\nBasket \u201d ), and an amount of cash (the \u201c Cash\nAmount, \u201d as described below) in order to\neffect redemptions of Creation Units of the\nFund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount\nwill remain in effect until such time as the\nnext announced composition of the Fund\nSecurities and Cash Amount is made available.\nThe Fund Securities and Cash Amount are\nsubject to possible amendment or correction.\nFund Securities received on redemption may not\nbe identical to Deposit Securities that are\napplicable to creations of Creation Units.\nProcedures and requirements governing\nredemption transactions are set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants and may\nchange from time to time. If redemptions are\nnot paid in cash, the redemption proceeds for\na Creation Unit generally consist of Fund\nSecurities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an\namount equal to the difference between the NAV\nof the shares being redeemed, as next\ndetermined after the receipt of a redemption\nrequest in proper form, and the value of Fund\nSecurities, less a redemption transaction fee\n(as described below). The Trust may, in its\nsole discretion, substitute a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d\namount to replace any Fund Security in certain\ncircumstances, including: (i) when the\ndelivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized\nParticipant (or to an investor on whose behalf\nthe Authorized Participant is acting) would be\nrestricted under applicable securities or\nother local laws or due to a trading\nrestriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund\nSecurity to the Authorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Fund Security\nby the Authorized Participant due to\nrestrictions under applicable securities or\nother local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a\nFund Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in unfavorable tax treatment;\n(iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or\notherwise delivered in time to facilitate an\nin-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other\nsituations. The amount of cash paid out in\nsuch cases will be equivalent to the value of\nthe substituted security listed as a Fund\nSecurity. In the event that the Fund\nSecurities have a value greater than the NAV\nof the shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the difference is required to be made\nby or through an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. The Fund generally\nredeems Creation Units partially for cash. The\nFund may, in its sole discretion, provide such\nredeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio\nof securities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Fund Securities, but does\nnot differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may\nalso be modified to minimize the Cash\nComponent by redistributing the cash to the\nFund Securities portion of the Redemption\nBasket through systematically rounding. The\nrounding methodology allows position sizes of\nsecurities in the Fund Securities to be \u201c\nrounded up, \u201d while limiting the maximum\nallowed percentage change in weight and share\nquantity of any given security in the\nRedemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also\nbe modified to position a fund towards a\nforward index rebalance to reflect revisions\nthat account for index additions, deletions,\nand re-weights. Cash Redemption Method.\nAlthough the Trust does not generally permit\nfull cash redemptions of Creation Units of its\nfunds, when partial or full cash redemptions\nof Creation Units are available or specified\n(Creation Units of the Fund are generally\nredeemed partially for cash or where the\nmarket for individual securities does not\npermit in-kind redemption), they will be\neffected in essentially the same manner as in-\nkind redemptions thereof. In the case of\npartial or full cash redemption, the\nAuthorized Participant receives the cash\nequivalent of the Fund Securities and other\ninstruments it would otherwise receive through\nan in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash\nAmount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer. The\nAuthorized Participant will also be required\nto pay certain transaction fees and charges\nfor cash redemptions, as described below, and,\nif transacting as broker with the Fund, may be\nrequired to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution and price movement\ncosts through an Execution Performance\nGuarantee, as described in the Brokerage\nTransactions section of this SAI. Cash\nredemption proceeds will be paid to the\nAuthorized Participant redeeming shares as\nsoon as practicable after the date of\nredemption or within seven calendar days\nthereafter. If a Fund settles redemptions on a\ncash basis and an Authorized Participant has\nentered into an Execution Performance\nGuarantee, but the Authorized Participant is\nunable, as determined by BFA in its sole\ndiscretion, to execute the market transactions\nthat are the subject of the Execution\nPerformance Guarantee due to an extended\nmarket holiday that goes over seven calendar\ndays or in certain other situations where all\nor a portion of the transactions are unable to\nbe executed within seven calendar days, then\nthe Fund may pay the full amount of the\nredemption order (or the remaining amount of\nthe redemption order based on the unexecuted\nportion of the transaction) within the\noriginal seven calendar day period by using\nthe Fund\u2019s overdraft facility, line of credit\nor cash on hand. The Authorized Participant\n(or an affiliated or unaffiliated broker-\ndealer), acting on an agency basis, will\nsubsequently enter into one or more separate\nmarket transactions when the markets reopen or\nthe trades are otherwise able to be executed\nthrough which a Fund sells the Fund Securities\n(or the remaining unsold Fund Securities)\nsubject to a guaranteed sales price. If the\nAuthorized Participant (or an affiliated or\nunaffiliated broker-dealer) achieves\nexecutions in market transactions at a price\nmore favorable than a Fund\u2019s valuation of the\nFund Securities as of the NAV calculation\napplicable on the date of the\n\n74\n\nredemption, then the Authorized Participant\ngenerally may retain the excess transaction\nproceeds. Specifically, if the Authorized\nParticipant is unable to achieve executions in\nmarket transactions at a price at least equal\nto the Fund\u2019s valuation of the Fund Securities\nas of the NAV calculation applicable on the\ndate of the redemption, then the Authorized\nParticipant is generally required to make the\napplicable shortfall payment to the Fund. In\naddition, if transacting as broker with a Fund\nin a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the Authorized\nParticipant may be required to cover foreign\nexchange costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI. If\nthe foreign exchange transaction associated\nwith the applicable security trades can only\noccur upon the settlement of a security trade\nand such trades are unable, as determined by\nBFA in its sole discretion, to be settled by\nthe seventh calendar day after receipt of the\nAuthorized Participant\u2019s redemption order,\nthen a Fund may pay within the original seven\ncalendar day period the amount due in respect\nof the redemption order based on the foreign\nexchange rate as of the date of the redemption\norder by using the Fund\u2019s overdraft facility,\nline of credit or cash on hand (in addition to\nany sales proceeds from the executed portion\nof the original brokerage order) and\nsubsequently enter into one or more separate\nforeign exchange transactions with the\nAuthorized Participant (or a broker-dealer\naffiliate of the Authorized Participant or a\nthird-party broker-dealer engaged through the\nAuthorized Participant), acting on an agency\nbasis, and be subject to a guaranteed sales\nprice. If the Authorized Participant achieves\nexecution of the foreign exchange transactions\nat a price more favorable than the foreign\nexchange rate as of the NAV calculation\napplicable on the date of the redemption, then\nthe Authorized Participant generally may\nretain the excess transaction proceeds. If the\nAuthorized Participant is unable to achieve\nexecution of the foreign exchange transactions\nat a price at least equal to the foreign\nexchange rate as of the NAV calculation\napplicable on the date of the redemption, then\nthe Authorized Participant is required to make\nthe applicable shortfall payment to the Fund.\nCosts Associated with Redemption Transactions.\nA standard redemption transaction fee is\nimposed to offset transfer, processing and\nother transaction costs that may be incurred\nby the Fund. The standard redemption\ntransaction fee is charged on each Creation\nUnit redeemed by an Authorized Participant on\nthe day of the transaction. The standard\nredemption transaction fee is generally fixed\nat the amount shown in the table below\nregardless of the number of Creation Units\nbeing redeemed, but may be reduced by the Fund\nif transfer and processing expenses associated\nwith the redemption are anticipated to be\nlower than the stated fee. In order to defray\ntransaction expenses for the Fund and protect\nagainst possible shareholder dilution, if a\nredemption transaction consists solely or\npartially of cash, the Authorized Participant\nmay also be required to cover (up to the\nmaximum amount shown below) certain brokerage,\ntax, foreign exchange, execution and other\ncosts and expenses related to the execution of\ntrades resulting from such transaction (which\nmay, in certain instances, be based on a good\nfaith estimate of transaction costs based on\nhistorical data or other inputs, at\nBlackRock\u2019s discretion, and may include part\nor all of the spread between the expected bid\nand offer side of the market and anticipated\nmarket impact). However, the Fund is not\nobligated to trade identical securities to the\nsecurities identified by BlackRock in\nestimating these transaction and other costs\nand expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or\nan affiliate may determine in its discretion\nto deviate from the regular charge, subject to\nthe maximum amounts shown below. Authorized\nParticipants will also bear the costs of\ntransferring the Fund Securities from the Fund\nto their account on their order. Certain\nfees/costs associated with redemption\ntransactions may be waived in certain\ncircumstances. Investors who use the services\nof a broker or other financial intermediary to\ndispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee\nfor such services. The following table sets\nforth the Fund's standard redemption\ntransaction fees and maximum additional charge\n(as described above):\n                                              \n  Standard              Maximum               \n  RedemptionTransacti\u2026  AdditionalCharge*     \n  Fee                                         \n  $1,800                2.0%                  \n                                              \n* As a percentage of the net asset value per\nCreation Unit, inclusive of the standard\nredemption transaction fee. If a redemption\nconsists of a cash portion and the Fund places\na brokerage transaction to sell portfolio\nsecurities with the Authorized Participant (or\nan affiliated or unaffiliated broker-dealer),\nthe Authorized Participant may be required, in\nits\n\n75\n\ncapacity as broker-dealer with respect to that\ntransaction, to cover certain brokerage, tax,\nforeign exchange, execution, and price\nmovement costs through an Execution\nPerformance Guarantee, as described in the\nBrokerage Transactions section of this SAI.\nPlacement of Redemption Orders. Redemption\nrequests for Creation Units of the Fund must\nbe submitted to the Distributor or its agent\nby or through an Authorized Participant. An\nAuthorized Participant must submit an\nirrevocable request to redeem shares of the\nFund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time\non any Business Day in order to receive that\nday's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange\ncloses earlier than normal, the Fund may\nrequire orders to redeem Creation Units to be\nplaced earlier that day. Investors, other than\nAuthorized Participants, are responsible for\nmaking arrangements for a redemption request\nto be made through an Authorized Participant.\nThe Distributor or its agent will provide a\nlist of current Authorized Participants upon\nrequest. The Authorized Participant must\ntransmit the request for redemption in the\nform required by the Fund to the Distributor\nor its agent in accordance with procedures set\nforth in the Authorized Participant Agreement.\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not have executed an\nAuthorized Participant Agreement and that,\ntherefore, requests to redeem Creation Units\nmay have to be placed by the investor's broker\nthrough an Authorized Participant who has\nexecuted an Authorized Participant Agreement.\nAt any time, only a limited number of broker-\ndealers will have an Authorized Participant\nAgreement in effect. Investors making a\nredemption request should be aware that such\nrequest must be in the form specified by such\nAuthorized Participant. Investors making a\nrequest to redeem Creation Units should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe request by an Authorized Participant and\ntransfer of the shares to the Fund's transfer\nagent; such investors should allow for the\nadditional time that may be required to effect\nredemptions through their banks, brokers or\nother financial intermediaries if such\nintermediaries are not Authorized\nParticipants. A redemption request is\nconsidered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if: (i) an\nAuthorized Participant has transferred or\ncaused to be transferred to the Fund's\ntransfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed\nthrough the book-entry system of DTC so as to\nbe effective by the Listing Exchange closing\ntime on any Business Day on which the\nredemption request is submitted; (ii) a\nrequest in form satisfactory to the Fund is\nreceived by the Distributor or its agent from\nthe Authorized Participant on behalf of itself\nor another redeeming investor within the time\nperiods specified above; and (iii) all other\nprocedures set forth in the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement are properly followed.\nUpon receiving a redemption request, the\nDistributor or its agent shall notify the Fund\nand the Fund's transfer agent of such\nredemption request. The tender of an\ninvestor's shares for redemption and the\ndistribution of the securities and/or cash\nincluded in the redemption payment made in\nrespect of Creation Units redeemed will be\nmade through DTC and the relevant Authorized\nParticipant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as\nrecorded on the book-entry system of DTC or\nthe DTC Participant through which such\ninvestor holds, as the case may be, or by such\nother means specified by the Authorized\nParticipant submitting the redemption request.\nA redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on\nits own account or acting on behalf of a\nBeneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate\nsecurity arrangements with a qualified broker-\ndealer, bank or other custody providers in\neach jurisdiction in which any of the\nportfolio securities are customarily traded,\nto which account such portfolio securities\nwill be delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds by the Fund are generally made within\ntwo Business Days ( i.e ., \u201c T+2 \u201d ). However,\nthe Fund reserves the right to settle\nredemption transactions on a basis other than\nT+2, including a shorter settlement period, if\nnecessary or appropriate under the\ncircumstances and compliant with applicable\nlaw. For example, the Fund reserves the right\nto settle redemption transactions on a basis\nother than T+2 in order to accommodate\nnon-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account\nfor different treatment among non-U.S. and\nU.S. markets of dividend record dates and\ndividend ex-dates ( i.e. , the last date the\nholder of a security can sell the security and\nstill receive dividends payable on the\nsecurity sold) and in certain other\ncircumstances consistent with applicable law.\nIf neither the Authorized Participant nor the\nBeneficial Owner on whose behalf the\nAuthorized Participant is acting has\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nFund Securities in the applicable non-U.S.\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, the Fund may\nin its discretion exercise its option to\nredeem such shares in cash, and the Beneficial\nOwner will be required to receive its\nredemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the\ninvestor will receive a cash payment equal to\nthe net asset value of its shares based on the\nNAV of the Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charges specified above to offset\nthe Fund's brokerage and other transaction\ncosts associated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). Redemptions of shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\n\n76\n\napplicable U.S. federal and state securities\nlaws and the Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right\nto redeem Creation Units for cash to the\nextent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver\nspecific Fund Securities upon redemptions or\ncannot do so without first registering the\nFund Securities under such laws. Although the\nTrust does not ordinarily permit cash\nredemptions of Creation Units (except that, as\nnoted above, Creation Units of the Fund\ngenerally will be redeemed partially for\ncash), in the event that cash redemptions are\npermitted or required by the Trust, proceeds\nwill be paid to the Authorized Participant\nredeeming shares as soon as practicable after\nthe date of redemption (within seven calendar\ndays thereafter). If the Fund includes a\nforeign investment in its basket, and if a\nlocal market holiday, or series of consecutive\nholidays, or the extended delivery cycles for\ntransferring foreign investments to redeeming\nAuthorized Participants prevents timely\ndelivery of the foreign investment in response\nto a redemption request, the Fund may delay\ndelivery of the foreign investment more than\nseven days if the Fund delivers the foreign\ninvestment as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 days. To the extent\ncontemplated by an Authorized Participant's\nagreement with the Distributor or its agent,\nin the event an Authorized Participant has\nsubmitted a redemption request in proper form\nbut is unable to transfer all or part of the\nCreation Unit to be redeemed to the Fund, at\nor prior to the time specified by the Fund or\nits custodian on the Business Day after the\ndate of submission of such redemption request,\nthe Distributor or its agent will accept the\nredemption request in reliance on the\nundertaking by the Authorized Participant to\ndeliver the missing shares as soon as\npossible. Such undertaking shall be secured by\nthe Authorized Participant's delivery and\nmaintenance of collateral as set forth in the\nhandbook for Authorized Participants. Such\ncollateral must be delivered no later than the\ntime specified by the Fund or its custodian on\nthe Business Day after the date of submission\nof such redemption request and shall be held\nby State Street and marked-to-market daily.\nThe fees of State Street and any sub-\ncustodians in respect of the delivery,\nmaintenance and redelivery of the collateral\nshall be payable by the Authorized\nParticipant. The Authorized Participant\nAgreement permits the Fund to acquire shares\nof the Fund at any time and subjects the\nAuthorized Participant to liability for any\nshortfall between the aggregate of the cost to\nthe Fund of purchasing such shares, plus the\nvalue of the Cash Amount, and the value of the\ncollateral together with liability for related\nbrokerage and other charges. Because the\nportfolio securities of the Fund may trade on\nexchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange\nis closed or are otherwise not Business Days\nfor the Fund, shareholders may not be able to\nredeem their shares of the Fund or purchase or\nsell shares of the Fund on the Listing\nExchange on days when the NAV of the Fund\ncould be significantly affected by events in\nthe relevant non-U.S. markets. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of\npayment postponed with respect to the Fund:\n(i) for any period during which the Listing\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Listing\nExchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for\nany period during which an emergency exists as\na result of which disposal of the shares of\nthe Fund's portfolio securities or\ndetermination of its NAV is not reasonably\npracticable; or (iv) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\nCustom Baskets. Creation and Redemption\nbaskets may differ and the Fund may accept \u201c\ncustom baskets. \u201d A custom basket may include\nany of the following: (i) a basket that is\ncomposed of a non-representative selection of\nthe Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a\nrepresentative basket that is different from\nthe initial basket used in transactions on the\nsame business day; or (iii) a basket that\ncontains bespoke cash substitutions for a\nsingle Authorized Participant. The Fund has\nadopted policies and procedures that govern\nthe construction and acceptance of baskets,\nincluding heightened requirements for certain\ntypes of custom baskets. Such policies and\nprocedures provide the parameters for the\nconstruction and acceptance of custom baskets\nthat are in the best interests of the Fund and\nits shareholders, establish processes for\nrevisions to, or deviations from, such\nparameters, and specify the titles and roles\nof the employees of BFA who are required to\nreview each custom basket for compliance with\nthose parameters. In addition, when\nconstructing custom baskets for redemptions,\nthe tax efficiency of the Fund may be taken\ninto account. The policies and procedures\ndistinguish among different types of custom\nbaskets that may be used for the Fund and\nimpose different requirements for different\ntypes of custom baskets in order to seek to\nmitigate against potential risks of conflicts\nand/or overreaching by an Authorized\nParticipant. BlackRock has established a\ngovernance process to oversee basket\ncompliance for the Fund, as set forth in the\nFund's policies and procedures.\n\n77\n\nTaxation on Creations and Redemptions of\nCreation Units. An Authorized Participant\ngenerally will recognize either gain or loss\nupon the exchange of Deposit Securities for\nCreation Units. This gain or loss is\ncalculated by taking the market value of the\nCreation Units purchased over the Authorized\nParticipant\u2019s aggregate basis in the Deposit\nSecurities exchanged therefor. However, the\nIRS may apply the wash sales rules to\ndetermine that any loss realized upon the\nexchange of Deposit Securities for Creation\nUnits is not currently deductible. Authorized\nParticipants should consult their own tax\nadvisors. Current U.S. federal income tax laws\ndictate that capital gain or loss realized\nfrom the redemption of Creation Units will\ngenerally create long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Authorized Participant holds the\nCreation Units for more than one year, or\nshort-term capital gain or loss if the\nCreation Units were held for one year or less,\nif the Creation Units are held as capital\nassets.\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations regarding the purchase,\nownership and disposition of shares of the\nFund. This summary does not address all of the\npotential U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat may be applicable to the Fund or to all\ncategories of investors, some of which may be\nsubject to special tax rules. Current and\nprospective shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the\nspecific U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of investing in the\nFund. The summary is based on the laws and\njudicial and administrative interpretations\nthereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all\nof which are subject to change, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Regulated Investment\nCompany Qualifications. The Fund intends to\nqualify for treatment as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must\nannually distribute at least 90% of its\ninvestment company taxable income (which\nincludes dividends, interest and net short-\nterm capital gains) and meet several other\nrequirements. Among such other requirements\nare the following: (i) at least 90% of the\nFund\u2019s annual gross income must be derived\nfrom dividends, interest, payments with\nrespect to securities loans, gains from the\nsale or other disposition of stock or\nsecurities or non-U.S. currencies, other\nincome (including, but not limited to, gains\nfrom options, futures or forward contracts)\nderived with respect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships ( i.e., partnerships that are\ntraded on an established securities market or\ntradable on a secondary market, other than\npartnerships that derive at least 90% of their\nincome from interest, dividends, capital gains\nand other traditionally permitted RIC income);\nand (ii) at the close of each quarter of the\nFund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of the Fund\u2019s total assets must\nbe represented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited for purposes of this\ncalculation in respect of any one issuer to an\namount not greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s assets and not greater than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of the\nFund's total assets may be invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government\nsecurities or the securities of other RICs) of\nany one issuer, of two or more issuers of\nwhich 20% or more of the voting stock is held\nby the Fund and that are engaged in the same\nor similar trades or businesses or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly-traded\npartnerships. The Fund may be able to cure a\nfailure to derive at least 90% of its income\nfrom the sources specified above or a failure\nto diversify its holdings in the manner\ndescribed above by paying a tax and/or by\ndisposing of certain assets. If, in any\ntaxable year, the Fund fails one of these\ntests and does not timely cure the failure,\nthe Fund will be taxed in the same manner as\nan ordinary corporation and distributions to\nits shareholders will not be deductible by the\nFund in computing its taxable income.\nAlthough, in general, the passive loss rules\nof the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to\nRICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with\nrespect to items attributable to interests in\nqualified publicly-traded partnerships. The\nFund's investments in partnerships, including\nin qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may\nresult in the Fund being subject to state,\nlocal, or non-U.S. income, franchise or\nwithholding tax liabilities. Taxation of RICs.\nAs a RIC, the Fund will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on the portion of its\ntaxable investment income and capital gains\nthat it distributes to its shareholders,\nprovided that it satisfies a minimum\ndistribution requirement. To satisfy the\nminimum distribution requirement, the Fund\nmust distribute to its shareholders at least\nthe sum of (i) 90% of its \u201c investment company\ntaxable income \u201d ( i.e., income other than the\nexcess of its net realized long-term capital\ngain over its net realized short-term capital\nloss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and\n(ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the\ntaxable year. The Fund will be subject to\nincome tax at regular corporate rates on any\ntaxable income or gains that it does not\n\n78\n\ndistribute to its shareholders. If the Fund\nfails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC\nor fails to meet the distribution requirement,\nall of its taxable income will be subject to\ntax at regular corporate income tax rates\nwithout any deduction for distributions to\nshareholders, and such distributions generally\nwill be taxable to shareholders as ordinary\ndividends to the extent of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits. In such\nevent, distributions to individuals should be\neligible to be treated as qualified dividend\nincome and distributions to corporate\nshareholders generally should be eligible for\nthe dividends received deduction. Although the\nFund intends to distribute substantially all\nof its net investment income and its capital\ngains for each taxable year, the Fund may\ndecide to retain a portion of its income or\ngains if the Fund determines that doing so is\nin the interest of its shareholders. The Fund\nwill be subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation to the extent any such income or\ngains are not distributed. If the Fund fails\nto qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay\nout its earnings and profits accumulated in\nthat year in order to qualify again as a RIC.\nIf the Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a\nperiod greater than two taxable years, the\nFund may be required to recognize any net\nbuilt-in gains with respect to certain of its\nassets ( i.e., the excess of the aggregate\ngains, including items of income, over\naggregate losses that would have been realized\nwith respect to such assets if the Fund had\nbeen liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. Excise Tax. The Fund will be\nsubject to a 4% excise tax on certain\nundistributed income if it does not distribute\nto its shareholders in each calendar year at\nleast 98% of its ordinary income for the\ncalendar year plus at least 98.2% of its\ncapital gain net income for the 12 months\nended October 31 of such year. For this\npurpose, however, any ordinary income or\ncapital gain net income retained by the Fund\nthat is subject to corporate income tax will\nbe considered to have been distributed by\nyear-end. In addition, the minimum amounts\nthat must be distributed in any year to avoid\nthe excise tax will be increased or decreased\nto reflect any underdistribution or\noverdistribution, as the case may be, from the\nprevious year. The Fund intends to declare and\ndistribute dividends and distributions in the\namounts and at the times necessary to avoid\nthe application of this 4% excise tax. Net\nCapital Loss Carryforwards. Net capital loss\ncarryforwards may be applied against any net\nrealized capital gains in each succeeding\nyear, until they have been reduced to zero. In\nthe event that the Fund were to experience an\nownership change as defined under the Internal\nRevenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other\nfavorable tax attributes of the Fund, if any,\nmay be subject to limitation. Taxation of U.S.\nShareholders. Dividends and other\ndistributions by the Fund are generally\ntreated under the Internal Revenue Code as\nreceived by the shareholders at the time the\ndividend or distribution is made. However, any\ndividend or distribution declared by the Fund\nin October, November or December of any\ncalendar year and payable to shareholders of\nrecord on a specified date in such a month\nshall be deemed to have been received by each\nshareholder on December 31 of such calendar\nyear and to have been paid by the Fund not\nlater than such December 31, provided such\ndividend is actually paid by the Fund during\nJanuary of the following calendar year. The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income and any net\nrealized long-term capital gains in excess of\nnet realized short-term capital losses\n(including any capital loss carryovers).\nHowever, if the Fund retains for investment an\namount equal to all or a portion of its net\nlong-term capital gains in excess of its net\nshort-term capital losses (including any\ncapital loss carryovers), it will be subject\nto a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on\nthe amount retained. In that event, the Fund\nwill designate such retained amounts as\nundistributed capital gains in a notice to its\nshareholders who (a) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gains, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount, (b) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the tax paid by the\nFund on the undistributed amount against their\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any,\nand to claim refunds to the extent their\ncredits exceed their liabilities, if any, and\n(c) will be entitled to increase their tax\nbasis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nin their shares by an amount equal to the\nexcess of the amount in clause (a) over the\namount in clause (b). Organizations or persons\nnot subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ncapital gains will be entitled to a refund of\ntheir pro rata share of such taxes paid by the\nFund upon filing appropriate returns or claims\nfor refund with the IRS. Distributions of net\nrealized long-term capital gains, if any, that\nthe Fund reports as capital gains dividends\nare taxable as long-term capital gains,\nwhether paid in cash or in shares and\nregardless of how long a shareholder has held\nshares of the Fund. All other dividends of the\nFund (including dividends from short-term\ncapital gains) from its current and\naccumulated earnings and profits ( \u201c regular\ndividends \u201d ) are generally subject to tax as\nordinary income, subject to the discussion of\nqualified dividend income below. Long-term\ncapital gains are eligible for taxation at a\nmaximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate\nshareholders, depending on whether their\nincome exceeds certain threshold amounts.\n\n79\n\nIf an individual receives a regular dividend\nqualifying for the long-term capital gains\nrates and such dividend constitutes an \u201c\nextraordinary dividend, \u201d and the individual\nsubsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or\nexchange of stock in respect of which the\nextraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss\nwill be long-term capital loss to the extent\nof such extraordinary dividend. An \u201c\nextraordinary dividend \u201d on common stock for\nthis purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an\namount greater than or equal to 10% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within an 85-day period, or\n(ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s tax basis (or trading value) in a\nshare of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-\ndividend dates within a 365-day period.\nDistributions in excess of the Fund\u2019s current\nand accumulated earnings and profits will, as\nto each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free\nreturn of capital to the extent of a\nshareholder\u2019s basis in shares of the Fund, and\nas a capital gain thereafter (if the\nshareholder holds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets). Distributions in excess of\nthe Fund\u2019s minimum distribution requirements,\nbut not in excess of the Fund\u2019s earnings and\nprofits, will be taxable to shareholders and\nwill not constitute nontaxable returns of\ncapital. Shareholders receiving dividends or\ndistributions in the form of additional shares\nshould be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as receiving a distribution in an\namount equal to the amount of money that the\nshareholders receiving cash dividends or\ndistributions will receive and should have a\ncost basis in the shares received equal to\nsuch amount. A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax is imposed on net investment\nincome, including, but not limited to,\ninterest, dividends, and net gain from\ninvestments, of U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates and trusts.\nInvestors considering buying shares just prior\nto a dividend or capital gain distribution\nshould be aware that, although the price of\nshares purchased at that time may reflect the\namount of the forthcoming distribution, such\ndividend or distribution may nevertheless be\ntaxable to them. If the Fund is the holder of\nrecord of any security on the record date for\nany dividends payable with respect to such\nsecurity, such dividends will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s gross income not as of the date\nreceived but as of the later of (a) the date\nsuch security became ex-dividend with respect\nto such dividends ( i.e. , the date on which a\nbuyer of the security would not be entitled to\nreceive the declared, but unpaid, dividends);\nor (b) the date the Fund acquired such\nsecurity. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its\nincome distribution requirements, the Fund may\nbe required to pay dividends based on\nanticipated earnings, and shareholders may\nreceive dividends in an earlier year than\nwould otherwise be the case. In certain\nsituations, the Fund may, for a taxable year,\ndefer all or a portion of its net capital loss\n(or if there is no net capital loss, then any\nnet long-term or short-term capital loss)\nrealized after October and its late-year\nordinary loss (defined as the sum of (i) the\nexcess of post-October foreign currency and\npassive foreign investment company ( \u201c PFIC \u201d\n) losses over post-October foreign currency\nand PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-\nDecember ordinary losses over post-December\nordinary income) until the next taxable year\nin computing its investment company taxable\nincome and net capital gain, which will defer\nthe recognition of such realized losses. Such\ndeferrals and other rules regarding gains and\nlosses realized after October (or December)\nmay affect the tax character of shareholder\ndistributions. Sales of Shares. Upon the sale\nor exchange of shares of the Fund, a\nshareholder will realize a taxable gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the\namount realized and the shareholder\u2019s basis in\nshares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by\nthe Fund will be treated as a sale for this\npurpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are capital\nassets in the shareholder\u2019s hands and will be\nlong-term capital gain or loss if the shares\nare held for more than one year and short-term\ncapital gain or loss if the shares are held\nfor one year or less. Any loss realized on a\nsale or exchange will be disallowed to the\nextent the shares disposed of are replaced,\nincluding replacement through the reinvesting\nof dividends or capital gains distributions,\nor by an option or contract to acquire\nsubstantially identical shares, within a\n61-day period beginning 30 days before and\nending 30 days after the disposition of the\nshares. In such a case, the basis of the\nshares acquired will be increased to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a\nshareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by\nthe shareholder for six months or less will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany distributions or deemed distributions of\nlong-term capital gains received by the\nshareholder with respect to such share. The\nMedicare contribution tax described above will\napply to the sale of Fund shares. If a\nshareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring\nshares of the Fund, disposes of those shares\nwithin 90 days and then, on or before January\n31 of the following calendar year, acquires\nshares in a mutual fund for which the\notherwise applicable sales charge is reduced\nby reason of a reinvestment right ( e.g. , an\nexchange privilege), the original sales charge\nwill not be taken into account in computing\ngain/loss on the original shares to the extent\nthe subsequent sales charge is reduced.\nInstead, the disregarded portion of the\noriginal sales charge will be added to the tax\nbasis of the newly acquired shares.\nFurthermore, the\n\n80\n\nsame rule also applies to a disposition of the\nnewly acquired shares made within 90 days of\nthe second acquisition. This provision\nprevents shareholders from immediately\ndeducting the sales charge by shifting their\ninvestments within a family of mutual funds.\nBackup Withholding. In certain cases, the Fund\nwill be required to withhold at a 24% rate and\nremit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts\nwithheld from any distributions paid to a\nshareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number; (ii)\nis subject to backup withholding by the IRS;\n(iii) has failed to certify to the Fund that\nsuch shareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding; or (iv) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). Backup withholding is\nnot an additional tax and any amount withheld\nmay be credited against a shareholder's U.S.\nfederal income tax liability. Sections 351 and\n362. The Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has the\nright to reject an order for a purchase of\nshares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group\nof purchasers) would, upon obtaining the\nshares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund and if,\npursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, the Fund would have a\nbasis in the securities different from the\nmarket value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. If the Fund\u2019s basis in such\nsecurities on the date of deposit was less\nthan market value on such date, the Fund, upon\ndisposition of the securities, would recognize\nmore taxable gain or less taxable loss than if\nits basis in the securities had been equal to\nmarket value. It is not anticipated that the\nTrust will exercise the right of rejection\nexcept in a case where the Trust determines\nthat accepting the order could result in\nmaterial adverse tax consequences to the Fund\nor its shareholders. The Trust also has the\nright to require information necessary to\ndetermine beneficial share ownership for\npurposes of the 80% determination. Taxation of\nCertain Derivatives. The Fund\u2019s transactions\nin zero coupon securities, non-U.S.\ncurrencies, forward contracts, options and\nfutures contracts (including options and\nfutures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to\nthe extent permitted, will be subject to\nspecial provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode (including provisions relating to \u201c\nhedging transactions \u201d and \u201c straddles \u201d )\nthat, among other consequences, may affect the\ncharacter of gains and losses realized by the\nFund ( i.e. , may affect whether gains or\nlosses are ordinary or capital), accelerate\nrecognition of income to the Fund and defer\nFund losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also (a) will require the Fund to\nmark-to-market certain types of the positions\nin its portfolio ( i.e. , treat them as if\nthey were closed out at the end of each year)\nand (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income\nwithout receiving cash with which to pay\ndividends or make distributions in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\ntaxes. The Fund will monitor its transactions,\nwill make the appropriate tax elections and\nwill make the appropriate entries in its books\nand records when it acquires any zero coupon\nsecurity, non-U.S. currency, forward contract,\noption, futures contract or hedged investment\nin order to mitigate the effect of these rules\nand prevent disqualification of the Fund as a\nRIC. The Fund\u2019s investments in so-called \u201c\nSection 1256 contracts, \u201d such as regulated\nfutures contracts, most non-U.S. currency\nforward contracts traded in the interbank\nmarket and options on most security indexes,\nare subject to special tax rules. All Section\n1256 contracts held by the Fund at the end of\nits taxable year are required to be marked to\ntheir market value, and any unrealized gain or\nloss on those positions will be included in\nthe Fund\u2019s income as if each position had been\nsold for its fair market value at the end of\nthe taxable year. The resulting gain or loss\nwill be combined with any gain or loss\nrealized by the Fund from positions in Section\n1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.\nProvided such positions were held as capital\nassets and were not part of a \u201c hedging\ntransaction \u201d nor part of a \u201c straddle, \u201d 60%\nof the resulting net gain or loss will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss, and\n40% of such net gain or loss will be treated\nas short-term capital gain or loss, regardless\nof the period of time the positions were\nactually held by the Fund. As a result of\nentering into swap contracts, the Fund may\nmake or receive periodic net payments. The\nFund may also make or receive a payment when a\nswap is terminated prior to maturity through\nan assignment of the swap or other closing\ntransaction. Periodic net payments will\ngenerally constitute ordinary income or\ndeductions, while termination of a swap will\ngenerally result in capital gain or loss\n(which will be a long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Fund has been a party to the swap\nfor more than one year). With respect to\ncertain types of swaps, the Fund may be\nrequired to currently recognize income or loss\nwith respect to future payments on such swaps\nor may elect under certain circumstances to\nmark such swaps to market annually for tax\npurposes as ordinary income or loss. Qualified\nDividend Income. Distributions by the Fund of\ninvestment company taxable income (including\nany short-term capital gains), whether\nreceived in cash or shares, will be taxable\neither as ordinary income or as qualified\ndividend income, which is eligible to be taxed\nat long-term capital gain rates to the extent\nthe Fund receives qualified dividend income on\nthe securities it holds and the Fund reports\nthe distribution as qualified dividend income.\nQualified dividend income is, in general,\n\n81\n\ndividend income from taxable U.S. corporations\n(but generally not from U.S. REITs) and\ncertain non-U.S. corporations ( e.g. ,\nnon-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and\nwhich are incorporated in a possession of the\nU.S. or in certain countries with a\ncomprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the\nstock of which is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the U.S.\n(where the dividends are paid with respect to\nsuch stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the\nU.S. has appropriate comprehensive income tax\ntreaties with the following countries:\nAustralia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados,\nBelgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China (but\nnot with Hong Kong, which is treated as a\nseparate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes),\nCyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt,\nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco,\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal,\nRomania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South\nAfrica, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago,\nTunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and\nVenezuela. Substitute payments received by the\nFund for securities lent out by the Fund will\nnot be qualified dividend income. A dividend\nfrom the Fund will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income to the extent that: (i) the\nshareholder has not held the shares on which\nthe dividend was paid for 61 days during the\n121-day period that begins on the date that is\n60 days before the date on which the shares\nbecome ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or the Fund fails to satisfy those\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe securities it holds that paid the\ndividends distributed to the shareholder (or,\nin the case of certain preferred stocks, the\nholding requirement of 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning on the date that is\n90 days before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend); (ii) the Fund or the shareholder is\nunder an obligation (whether pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related\npayments with respect to substantially similar\nor related property; or (iii) the shareholder\nelects to treat such dividend as investment\nincome under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Dividends received by\nthe Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be\ntreated as qualified dividend income only to\nthe extent the dividend distributions are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by such REIT or other RIC. It is\nexpected that dividends received by the Fund\nfrom a REIT and distributed to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the shareholder\nas ordinary income. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before\nJanuary 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who\nis a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% \u201c\nqualified business income \u201d deduction for\nordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report\ndividends as eligible for this deduction to\nthe extent the RIC\u2019s income is derived from\nordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable\nRIC expenses). A shareholder may treat the\ndividends as such provided the RIC and the\nshareholder satisfy applicable holding period\nrequirements. Distributions by the Fund of its\nnet short-term capital gains will be taxable\nas ordinary income. Corporate Dividends\nReceived Deduction. Dividends paid by the Fund\nthat are attributable to dividends received by\nthe Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify\nfor the U.S. federal dividends received\ndeduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum\nholding period during the 90-day period that\nbegins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or\n91-day minimum holding period during the 180\nperiod beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend\ndate for certain preference dividends) during\nwhich risk of loss may not be diminished is\nrequired for the applicable shares, at both\nthe Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend\nto be eligible for the dividends received\ndeduction. Restrictions may apply if\nindebtedness, including a short sale, is\nattributable to the investment. Excess\nInclusion Income. Under current law, the Fund\nserves to block unrelated business taxable\nincome ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ) from being realized by its\ntax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of its investment in\nthe Fund if shares in the Fund constitute\ndebt-financed property in the hands of the\ntax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of\nSection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain types of income received by the Fund\nfrom REITs, real estate mortgage investment\nconduits, taxable mortgage pools or other\ninvestments may cause the Fund to report some\nor all of its distributions as \u201c excess\ninclusion income. \u201d To Fund shareholders, such\nexcess inclusion income may: (i) constitute\ntaxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders\nwho would otherwise be tax-exempt such as\nindividual retirement accounts, 401(k)\naccounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and\ncertain charitable entities; (ii) not be\noffset by otherwise allowable deductions for\ntax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for\nreduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S.\nshareholders even from tax treaty countries;\nand (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax\nif certain \u201c disqualified organizations, \u201d as\ndefined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund\nshareholders. If a charitable remainder\nannuity trust or a charitable remainder\nunitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a\ntaxable year, a 100% excise tax on the UBTI is\nimposed on the trust. The Fund tries to avoid\ninvesting in REITs that are expected to\ngenerate excess inclusion income, but the Fund\nmay not always be successful in doing so.\nBecause information about a REIT\u2019s investments\nmay be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a\nREIT may change its investment program, the\nFund may not be successful in avoiding the\nconsequences described\n\n82\n\nabove. Avoidance of investments in REITs that\ngenerate excess inclusion income may require\nthe Fund to forego otherwise attractive\ninvestment opportunities. Non-U.S.\nInvestments. Under Section 988 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, gains or losses attributable to\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the\ntime the Fund accrues income or receivables or\nexpenses or other liabilities denominated in a\nnon-U.S. currency and the time the Fund\nactually collects such income or pays such\nliabilities are generally treated as ordinary\nincome or ordinary loss. In general, gains\n(and losses) realized on debt instruments will\nbe treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to\nthe extent attributable to changes in exchange\nrates between the U.S. dollar and the\ncurrencies in which the instruments are\ndenominated. Similarly, gains or losses on\nnon-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward\ncontracts and certain non-U.S. currency\noptions or futures contracts denominated in\nnon-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable\nto fluctuations in exchange rates between the\nacquisition and disposition dates, are also\ntreated as ordinary income or loss unless the\nFund were to elect otherwise. The Fund may be\nsubject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at\nthe source. The Fund, if permitted to do so,\nmay elect to \u201c pass through \u201d to its investors\nthe amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by\nthe Fund provided that the Fund held the\nsecurity on the dividend settlement date and\nfor at least 15 additional days immediately\nbefore and/or thereafter, with the result that\neach investor with respect to shares of the\nFund held for a minimum 16-day holding period\nat the time of deemed distribution will (i)\ninclude in gross income, even though not\nactually received, the investor\u2019s pro rata\nshare of the Fund\u2019s non-U.S. income taxes, and\n(ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S.\ntaxable income, but only for investors who\nitemize their deductions on their personal tax\nreturns) or credit (in calculating U.S.\nfederal income tax) the investor\u2019s pro rata\nshare of the Fund\u2019s non-U.S. income taxes.\nWithholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S.\nsecurities while such securities are lent out\nby the Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax\ncredit pass through. Taxes not \u201c passed\nthrough \u201d for tax purposes will not be\navailable to shareholders for foreign tax\ncredit purposes. A non-U.S. person invested in\nthe Fund in a year that the Fund elects to \u201c\npass through \u201d its non-U.S. taxes may be\ntreated as receiving additional dividend\nincome subject to U.S. withholding tax. A\nnon-U.S. tax credit may not exceed the\ninvestor\u2019s U.S. federal income tax otherwise\npayable with respect to the investor\u2019s\nnon-U.S. source income. For this purpose,\nshareholders must treat as non-U.S. source\ngross income (i) their proportionate shares of\nnon-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and (ii) the\nportion of any dividend paid by the Fund that\nrepresents income derived from non-U.S.\nsources; the Fund\u2019s gain from the sale of\nsecurities will generally be treated as\nU.S.-source income. Certain limitations will\nbe imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S.\ntax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares\nare loaned pursuant to securities lending\narrangements, you may lose the ability to use\nany non-U.S. tax credits passed through by the\nFund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while\nthe shares are held by the borrower) as\nqualified dividends. Regarding a short sale\nwith respect to shares of the Fund, substitute\npayments made to the lender of such shares may\nnot be deductible under certain circumstances.\nConsult your financial intermediary or tax\nadvisor. Passive Foreign Investment Companies.\nIf the Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax on a\nportion of any \u201c excess distribution \u201d or gain\nfrom the disposition of such shares even if\nsuch income is distributed as a taxable\ndividend by the Fund to its shareholders.\nAdditional charges in the nature of interest\nmay be imposed on the Fund in respect of\ndeferred taxes arising from such distributions\nor gains. If the Fund were to invest in a PFIC\nand elect to treat the PFIC as a \u201c qualified\nelecting fund \u201d under the Internal Revenue\nCode, in lieu of the foregoing requirements,\nthe Fund might be required to include in\nincome each year a portion of the ordinary\nearnings and net capital gains of the\nqualified electing fund, even if not\ndistributed to the Fund, and such amounts\nwould be subject to the 90% and excise tax\ndistribution requirements described above. In\norder to make this election, the Fund would be\nrequired to obtain certain annual information\nfrom the PFICs in which it invests, which may\nbe difficult or impossible to obtain.\nAlternatively, the Fund may make a mark-to-\nmarket election that would result in the Fund\nbeing treated as if it had sold and\nrepurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each\nyear. In such case, the Fund would report any\nsuch gains as ordinary income and would deduct\nany such losses as ordinary losses to the\nextent of previously recognized gains. The\nelection must be made separately for each PFIC\nowned by the Fund and, once made, would be\neffective for all subsequent taxable years,\nunless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By\nmaking the election, the Fund could\npotentially ameliorate the adverse tax\nconsequences with respect to its ownership of\nshares in a PFIC, but in any particular year\nmay be required to recognize income in excess\nof the distributions it receives from PFICs\nand its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC\nstock. The Fund may have to distribute this \u201c\nphantom \u201d income and gain to satisfy the 90%\ndistribution requirement and to avoid\nimposition of the 4% excise tax.\n\n83\n\nThe Fund will make the appropriate tax\nelections, if possible, and take any\nadditional steps that are necessary to\nmitigate the effects of these rules.\nReporting. If a shareholder recognizes a loss\nwith respect to the Fund\u2019s shares of $2\nmillion or more for an individual shareholder\nor $10 million or more for a corporate\nshareholder, the shareholder must file with\nthe IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form\n8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio\nsecurities are in many cases exempted from\nthis reporting requirement, but under current\nguidance, shareholders of a RIC are not\nexempted. The fact that a loss is reportable\nunder these regulations does not affect the\nlegal determination of whether the taxpayer\u2019s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisors to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances. Other\nTaxes. Dividends, distributions and redemption\nproceeds may also be subject to additional\nstate, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on\neach shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. Dividends\npaid by the Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at a 30%\nrate or a reduced rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty to the extent\nderived from investment income and short-term\ncapital gains. Dividends paid by the Fund from\nnet tax-exempt income or long-term capital\ngains are generally not subject to such\nwithholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced\nrate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder\nwill be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN\nor IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its\nentitlement to benefits under a treaty. The\nwithholding tax does not apply to regular\ndividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who\nprovides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that\nthe dividends are effectively connected with\nthe non-U.S. shareholder\u2019s conduct of a trade\nor business within the U.S. Instead, the\neffectively connected dividends will be\nsubject to regular U.S. income tax as if the\nnon-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder.\nA non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively\nconnected dividends may also be subject to\nadditional \u201c branch profits tax \u201d imposed at a\nrate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form\nW-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable\nform may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate. Properly-reported\ndividends are generally exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax where they (i) are\npaid in respect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified net\ninterest income \u201d (generally, the Fund\u2019s U.S.\nsource interest income, other than certain\ncontingent interest and interest from\nobligations of a corporation or partnership in\nwhich the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder\nor partner, reduced by expenses that are\nallocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in\nrespect of the Fund\u2019s \u201c qualified short-term\ncapital gains \u201d (generally, the excess of the\nFund\u2019s net short-term capital gain over the\nFund\u2019s long-term capital loss for such taxable\nyear). However, depending on its\ncircumstances, the Fund may report all, some\nor none of its potentially eligible dividends\nas such qualified net interest income or as\nqualified short-term capital gains and/or\ntreat such dividends, in whole or in part, as\nineligible for this exemption from\nwithholding. In order to qualify for this\nexemption from withholding, a non-U.S.\nshareholder will need to comply with\napplicable certification requirements relating\nto its non-U.S. status (including, in general,\nfurnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of\nshares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if the Fund\nreports the payment as qualified net interest\nincome or qualified short-term capital gain.\nNon-U.S. shareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts. Special\nrules may apply to a foreign shareholder\nreceiving a Fund distribution if at least 50%\nof the Fund's assets consist of interests in\nU.S. real property interests, including\ncertain REITs and U.S. real property holding\ncorporations (as defined in the Internal\nRevenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund\ndistributions that are attributable to gain\nfrom the disposition of a U.S. real property\ninterest will be taxable as ordinary dividends\nand subject to withholding at a 30% or lower\ntreaty rate if the foreign shareholder held no\nmore than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time\nduring the one-year period ending on the date\nof the distribution. If the foreign\nshareholder held more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares, the distribution would be treated as\nincome effectively connected with a trade or\nbusiness within the U.S. and the foreign\nshareholder would be subject to withholding\ntax at a rate of 21% and would generally be\nrequired to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn. Similar consequences would generally\napply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the\nsale of Fund shares unless the Fund is\ndomestically controlled (meaning that more\nthan 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is\nheld by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign\nshareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's\nshares at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of sale. Finally, a\ndomestically controlled Fund may be required\nto recognize a portion of its gain on the in-\nkind distribution of certain U.S. real\nproperty interests. Shareholders that are\nnonresident aliens or foreign entities are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the particular tax consequences to\nthem of an investment in the Fund.\n\n84\n\nA foreign shareholder also may be subject to\ncertain \u201c wash sale \u201d rules to prevent the\navoidance of the tax filing and payment\nobligations discussed above through the sale\nand repurchase of Fund shares. Shareholders\nthat are nonresident aliens or foreign\nentities are urged to consult their own tax\nadvisors concerning the particular tax\nconsequences to them of an investment in the\nFund. Separately, a 30% withholding tax is\ncurrently imposed on U.S.-source dividends,\ninterest and other income items paid to: (i)\nforeign financial institutions, including\nnon-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree\nto collect and disclose to the IRS information\nregarding their direct and indirect U.S.\naccount holders; and (ii) certain other\nforeign entities, unless they certify certain\ninformation regarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding,\nforeign financial institutions will need to:\n(i) enter into agreements with the IRS that\nstate that they will provide the IRS\ninformation, including the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification numbers of direct\nand indirect U.S. account holders; comply with\ndue diligence procedures with respect to the\nidentification of U.S. accounts; report to the\nIRS certain information with respect to U.S.\naccounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on\ncertain payments made to non-compliant foreign\nfinancial institutions or to account holders\nwho fail to provide the required information;\nand determine certain other information\nconcerning their account holders, or (ii) in\nthe event an intergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are adopted, provide\nlocal revenue authorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign entities may\nneed to report the name, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each substantial U.S.\nowner or provide certifications of no\nsubstantial U.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. Shares of the Fund held by a\nnon-U.S. shareholder at death will be\nconsidered situated within the U.S. and\nsubject to the U.S. estate tax. The foregoing\ndiscussion is a summary of certain material\nU.S. federal income tax considerations only\nand is not intended as a substitute for\ncareful tax planning. Purchasers of shares\nshould consult their own tax advisors as to\nthe tax consequences of investing in such\nshares, including consequences under state,\nlocal and non-U.S. tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date of this SAI. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur. Financial Statements Financial\nstatements for the Fund are not available\nbecause, as of the date of this SAI, the Fund\nhas no financial information to report.\nMiscellaneous Information Counsel. Willkie\nFarr & Gallagher LLP, located at 787 Seventh\nAvenue, New York, NY 10019, is counsel to the\nTrust. Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,\nlocated at Two Commerce Square, 2001 Market\nStreet, Philadelphia, PA 19103, serves as the\nTrust's independent registered public\naccounting firm, audits the Fund's financial\nstatements, and may perform other services.\nShareholder Communications to the Board.

Policy/Document\nRequirements and Statements The Boards of\nTrustees/Directors ( \u201c Directors \u201d ) of open-\nend funds (the \u201c Funds \u201d ) advised by\nBlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors,\nLLC ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ), have the responsibility\nfor the oversight of voting proxies relating\nto portfolio securities of the Funds, and have\ndetermined that it is in the best interests of\nthe Funds and their shareholders to delegate\nthe responsibility to vote proxies to\nBlackRock, subject to the principles outlined\nin this Policy, as part of BlackRock\u2019s\nauthority to manage, acquire and dispose of\naccount assets, all as contemplated by the\nFunds\u2019 respective investment management\nagreements.

We manage assets on\nbehalf of institutional and individual\nclients, across a full spectrum of investment\nstrategies, asset classes, and regions. Our\nclient base includes pension plans,\nendowments, foundations, charities, official\ninstitutions, insurers, and other financial\ninstitutions, as well as individuals around\nthe world. Philosophy on investment\nstewardship As part of our fiduciary duty to\nour clients, we consider it one of our\nresponsibilities to promote sound corporate\ngovernance as an informed, engaged shareholder\non their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the\nresponsibility of the BlackRock Investment\nStewardship (BIS) team. In our experience,\nsound governance is critical to the success of\na company, the protection of investors\u2019\ninterests, and long-term financial value\ncreation. We take a constructive, long-term\napproach with companies and seek to understand\nhow they are managing the drivers of risk and\nfinancial value creation in their business\nmodels. We have observed that well-managed\ncompanies will effectively evaluate and\naddress risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses, which supports durable,\nlong-term financial value creation. As one of\nmany minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot \u2013\nand does not try to \u2013 direct a company\u2019s\nstrategy or its implementation. Shareholder\nrights We believe that there are certain\nfundamental rights attached to shareholding.\nShareholders should have the right to: \u2022\nElect, remove, and nominate directors, approve\nthe appointment of the auditor, and amend the\ncorporate charter or by-laws. \u2022 Vote on key\nboard decisions that are material to the\nprotection of their investment, including but\nnot limited to, changes to the purpose of the\nbusiness, dilution levels and pre-emptive\nrights, and the distribution of income and\ncapital structure. \u2022 Access sufficient and\ntimely information on material governance,\nstrategic, and business matters to make\ninformed decisions. In our view, shareholder\nvoting rights should be proportionate to\neconomic ownership\u2014the principle of \u201c one\nshare, one vote \u201d helps to achieve this\nbalance. Consistent with these shareholder\nrights, BlackRock monitors and provides\nfeedback to companies in our role as stewards\nof our clients\u2019 assets. Investment stewardship\nis how we use our voice as an investor to\npromote sound corporate governance and\nbusiness practices that support the ability of\ncompanies to deliver long-term financial\nperformance for our clients. We do this\nthrough engagement with companies, proxy\nvoting on behalf of those clients who have\ngiven us authority, and participating in\nmarket-level dialogue to improve corporate\ngovernance standards. Engagement is an\nimportant mechanism for providing feedback on\ncompany practices and disclosures,\nparticularly where our observations indicate\nthat they could be enhanced to support a\ncompany\u2019s ability to deliver financial\nperformance. Similarly, it provides us with an\nopportunity to hear directly from company\nboards and management on how they believe\ntheir actions are aligned with the long-term\neconomic interests of shareholders. Engagement\nwith companies may also inform our proxy\nvoting decisions. As a fiduciary, we vote in\nthe long-term economic interests of our\nclients. Generally, we support the\nrecommendations of the board of directors and\nmanagement. However, there may be instances\nwhere we vote against the election of\ndirectors or other management proposals, or\nsupport shareholder proposals. For instance,\nwe may vote against management recommendations\nwhere we are concerned that the board may not\nbe acting in the long-term economic interests\nof shareholders, or disclosures do not provide\nsufficient information to assess how material,\nstrategic risks and opportunities are being\nmanaged. Our regional proxy voting guidelines\nare informed by our market-specific approach\nand standards of corporate governance best\npractices. Key Themes While accepted standards\nand norms of corporate governance can differ\nbetween markets, in our experience, there are\ncertain globally-applicable fundamental\nelements of governance that contribute to a\ncompany\u2019s ability to create long-term\nfinancial value for shareholders. These global\nthemes are set out in this overarching set of\nprinciples (the \u201c Principles \u201d ), which are\nanchored in transparency and accountability.\nAt a minimum, it is our view that companies\nshould observe the accepted\n\nA-4\n\ncorporate governance standards in their\ndomestic market and we ask that, if they do\nnot, they explain how their approach better\nsupports durable, long-term financial value\ncreation. These Principles cover seven key\nsubjects: \u2022 Boards and directors \u2022 Auditors\nand audit-related issues \u2022 Capital structure,\nmergers, asset sales, and other special\ntransactions \u2022 Executive compensation \u2022\nMaterial sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities \u2022 Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections \u2022\nShareholder proposals Our regional and market-\nspecific voting guidelines explain how these\nPrinciples inform our voting decisions in\nrelation to common ballot items for\nshareholder meetings in those markets.\nAlongside the Principles and regional voting\nguidelines, BIS publishes our engagement\npriorities which reflect the five themes on\nwhich we most frequently engage companies,\nwhere they are relevant, as these can be a\nsource of material business risk or\nopportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies\nset out the core elements of corporate\ngovernance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Boards and\ndirectors We believe that an effective and\nwell-functioning board that has appropriate\ngovernance structures to facilitate oversight\nof a company's management and strategic\ninitiatives is critical to the long-term\nfinancial success of a company and the\nprotection of shareholders\u2019 economic\ninterests. In our view, a strong board can be\na competitive advantage to a company,\nproviding valuable oversight of and\nperspectives to management on the most\nimportant decisions in support of long-term\nfinancial performance. As part of their\nresponsibilities, board members have a\nfiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the\nstrategic direction, operations, and risk\nmanagement of a company. For this reason, BIS\nsees engagement with and the election of\ndirectors as one of our most important\nresponsibilities. Disclosure of material risks\nthat may affect a company\u2019s long-term strategy\nand financial value creation, including\nmaterial sustainability-related factors when\nrelevant, is essential for shareholders to\nappropriately understand and assess how\neffectively management is identifying,\nmanaging, and mitigating such risks. The board\nshould establish and maintain a framework of\nrobust and effective governance mechanisms to\nsupport its oversight of the company\u2019s\nstrategy and operations consistent with the\nlong-term economic interests of investors.\nThere should be clear descriptions of the role\nof the board and the committees of the board\nand how directors engage with and oversee\nmanagement. We look to the board to articulate\nthe effectiveness of these mechanisms in\noverseeing the management of business risks\nand opportunities and the fulfillment of the\ncompany\u2019s purpose and strategy. Where a\ncompany has not adequately disclosed and\ndemonstrated that its board has fulfilled\nthese corporate governance and risk oversight\nresponsibilities, we will consider voting\nagainst the election of directors who, on our\nassessment, have particular responsibility for\nthe issues. We assess director performance on\na case-by-case basis and in light of each\ncompany\u2019s circumstances, taking into\nconsideration their governance, business\npractices that support durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation, and performance. Set\nout below are ways in which boards and\ndirectors can demonstrate a commitment to\nacting in the long-term economic interests of\nall shareholders. Regular accountability\nthrough director elections It is our view that\ndirectors should stand for election on a\nregular basis, ideally annually. In our\nexperience, annual director elections allow\nshareholders to reaffirm their support for\nboard members and/or hold them accountable for\ntheir decisions in a timely manner. When board\nmembers are not elected annually, in our\nexperience, it is good practice for boards to\nhave a rotation policy to ensure that, through\na board cycle, all directors have had their\nappointment re-confirmed, with a proportion of\ndirectors being put forward for election at\neach annual general meeting. Effective board\ncomposition Regular director elections also\ngive boards the opportunity to adjust their\ncomposition in an orderly way to reflect\ndevelopments in the company\u2019s strategy and the\nmarket environment. In our view, it is\nbeneficial for new directors to be\n\nA-5\n\nbrought onto the board periodically to refresh\nthe group\u2019s thinking, while supporting both\ncontinuity and appropriate succession\nplanning. We consider the average overall\ntenure of the board, and seek a balance\nbetween the knowledge and experience of\nlonger-serving directors and the fresh\nperspectives of directors who joined more\nrecently. We encourage companies to regularly\nreview the effectiveness of their board\n(including its size), and assess directors\nnominated for election in the context of the\ncomposition of the board as a whole. In our\nview, the company\u2019s assessment should consider\na number of factors, including each director\u2019s\nindependence and time commitments, as well as\nthe diversity and relevance of director\nexperiences and skillsets, and how these\nfactors may contribute to the financial\nperformance of the company. Similarly, there\nshould be a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors, free from conflicts of interest or\nundue influence from connected parties, to\nensure objectivity in the decision-making of\nthe board and its ability to oversee\nmanagement. Common impediments to independence\nmay include but are not limited to: \u2022 Current\nor recent employment at the company or a\nsubsidiary \u2022 Being, or representing, a\nshareholder with a substantial shareholding in\nthe company \u2022 Interlocking directorships \u2022\nHaving any other interest, business, or other\nrelationship which could, or could reasonably\nbe perceived to, materially interfere with a\ndirector\u2019s ability to act in the best\ninterests of the company and shareholders. In\nour experience, boards are most effective at\noverseeing and advising management when there\nis a senior, independent board leader. This\ndirector may chair the board, or, where the\nchair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not\nindependent), be designated as a lead\nindependent director. The role of this\ndirector is to enhance the effectiveness of\nthe independent members of the board through\nshaping the agenda, ensuring adequate\ninformation is provided to the board, and\nencouraging independent director participation\nin board deliberations. The lead independent\ndirector or another appropriate director\nshould be available to meet with shareholders\nin those situations where an independent\ndirector is best placed to explain and\ncontextualize a company\u2019s approach. There are\nmatters for which the board has responsibility\nthat may involve a conflict of interest for\nexecutives or for affiliated directors, or\nrequire additional focus. It is our view that\nobjective oversight of such matters is best\nachieved when the board forms committees\ncomprised entirely of independent directors.\nIn many markets, these committees of the board\nspecialize in audit, director nominations, and\ncompensation matters. An ad hoc committee\nmight also be formed to decide on a special\ntransaction, particularly one involving a\nrelated party, or to investigate a significant\nadverse event. When nominating directors to\nthe board, we look to companies to provide\nsufficient information on the individual\ncandidates so that shareholders can assess the\ncapabilities and suitability of each\nindividual nominee and their fit within\noverall board composition. These disclosures\nshould give an understanding of how the\ncollective experience and expertise of the\nboard, as well as the particular skill-sets of\nindividual directors, aligns with the\ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and business\nmodel. Highly qualified, engaged directors\nwith professional characteristics relevant to\na company\u2019s business and strategy enhance the\nability of the board to add value and be the\nvoice of shareholders in board discussions. It\nis in this context that we are interested in\ndiversity in the board room. We see it as a\nmeans to promoting diversity of thought and\navoiding \u201c group think \u201d when the board\nadvises and oversees management. This position\nis based on our view that diversity of\nperspective and thought \u2013 in the board room,\nin the management team, and throughout the\ncompany \u2013 leads to better long-term economic\noutcomes for companies. Academic research has\nrevealed correlations between specific\ndimensions of diversity and effects on\ndecision-making processes and outcomes. 1 In\nour experience, greater diversity in the board\nroom can contribute to more robust discussions\nand more innovative and resilient decisions.\nOver time, greater diversity in the board room\ncan also promote greater diversity and\nresilience in the leadership team, and the\nworkforce more broadly. That diversity can\nenable companies to develop businesses that\nbetter address the needs of the customers and\ncommunities they serve. We ask boards to\ndisclose how diversity is considered in board\ncomposition, including professional\ncharacteristics, such as a director\u2019s industry\nexperience, specialist areas of expertise and\ngeographic location; as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age. We look to understand\na board\u2019s diversity in the context of a\ncompany\u2019s domicile, market capitalization,\nbusiness model, and strategy. Increasingly, we\nsee the most effective boards nominating\ndirectors from diverse backgrounds which helps\nensure boards can more effectively understand\nthe company's customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We note that in many markets,\npolicymakers have set board gender diversity\ngoals which we may discuss with companies,\nparticularly if there is a\n\n1 For a discussion on the different impacts of\ndiversity see: McKinsey , \u201c Diversity Wins:\nHow Inclusion Matters, \u201d May 2022; Harvard\nBusiness Review , \u201c Diverse Teams Feel Less\nComfortable \u2013 and That\u2019s Why They Perform\nBetter, \u201d September 2016; \u201c Do Diverse\nDirectors Influence DEI Outcomes , \u201d September\n2022.\n\nA-6\n\nrisk their board composition may be\nmisaligned. Self-identified board demographic\ndiversity can usefully be disclosed in\naggregate, consistent with local law. We\nencourage boards to aspire to meaningful\ndiversity of membership, while recognizing\nthat building a strong, diverse board can take\ntime. Sufficient capacity As the role and\nexpectations of a director are increasingly\ndemanding, directors must be able to commit an\nappropriate amount of time to board and\ncommittee matters. It is important that\ndirectors have the capacity to meet all of\ntheir responsibilities - including when there\nare unforeseen events \u2013 and therefore, they\nshould not take on an excessive number of\nroles that would impair their ability to\nfulfill their duties. Auditors and audit-\nrelated issues BlackRock recognizes the\ncritical importance of financial statements,\nwhich should provide a true and fair picture\nof a company\u2019s financial condition.\nAccordingly, the assumptions made by\nmanagement and reviewed by the auditor in\npreparing the financial statements should be\nreasonable and justified. The accuracy of\nfinancial statements, inclusive of financial\nand non-financial information as required or\npermitted under market-specific accounting\nrules, is of paramount importance to\nBlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize\nthat a broader range of risks and\nopportunities have the potential to materially\nimpact financial performance. Over time, we\nanticipate investors and other users of\ncompany reporting will increasingly seek to\nunderstand and scrutinize the assumptions\nunderlying financial statements, particularly\nthose that pertain to the impact of the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy on a\ncompany\u2019s business model and asset mix. We\nrecognize that this is an area of evolving\npractice and note that international standards\nsetters, such as the International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards\nBoard (IAASB), continue to develop their\nguidance to companies. 2 In this context,\naudit committees, or equivalent, play a vital\nrole in a company\u2019s financial reporting system\nby providing independent oversight of the\naccounts, material financial and, where\nappropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial\ninformation and internal control frameworks.\nMoreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk\ncommittee, these committees can provide\noversight of Enterprise Risk Management\nsystems. 3 In our view, effective audit\ncommittee oversight strengthens the quality\nand reliability of a company\u2019s financial\nstatements and provides an important level of\nreassurance to shareholders. We hold members\nof the audit committee or equivalent\nresponsible for overseeing the management of\nthe audit function. Audit committees or\nequivalent should have clearly articulated\ncharters that set out their responsibilities\nand have a rotation plan in place that allows\nfor a periodic refreshment of the committee\nmembership to introduce fresh perspectives to\naudit oversight. We recognize that audit\ncommittees will rely on management, internal\naudit, and the independent auditor in\nfulfilling their responsibilities but look to\ncommittee members to demonstrate they have\nrelevant expertise to monitor and oversee the\naudit process and related activities. We take\nparticular note of unexplained changes in\nreporting methodology, cases involving\nsignificant financial restatements, or ad hoc\nnotifications of material financial weakness.\nIn this respect, audit committees should\nprovide timely disclosure on the remediation\nof Key and Critical Audit Matters identified\neither by the external auditor or internal\naudit function. The integrity of financial\nstatements depends on the auditor being free\nof any impediments to being an effective check\non management. To that end, it is important\nthat auditors are, and are seen to be,\nindependent. Where an audit firm provides\nservices to the company in addition to the\naudit, the fees earned should be disclosed and\nexplained. Audit committees should have in\nplace a procedure for assessing annually the\nindependence of the auditor and the quality of\nthe external audit process. Comprehensive\ndisclosure provides investors with a sense of\nthe company\u2019s long-term operational risk\nmanagement practices and, more broadly, the\nquality of the board\u2019s oversight. The audit or\nrisk committee, should periodically review the\ncompany\u2019s risk assessment and risk management\npolicies and the significant risks and\nexposures identified by management, the\ninternal auditors or the independent auditors\nand management\u2019s steps to address them. In the\nabsence of detailed disclosures, we may\nreasonably conclude that companies are not\nadequately managing risk.\n\n2 IFRS, \u201c IFRS S1 General Requirements for\nDisclosure of Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation \u201d , June 2023, and IAASB, \u201c IAASB\nLaunches Public Consultation on Landmark\nProposed Global Sustainability Assurance\nStandard \u201d , August 2023. 3 Enterprise risk\nmanagement is a process, effected by the\nentity\u2019s board of directors, management, and\nother personnel, applied in strategy setting\nand across the enterprise, designed to\nidentify potential events that may affect the\nentity, and manage risk to be within the risk\nappetite, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the achievement of objectives.\n(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO), Enterprise Risk\nManagement \u2014 Integrated Framework, September\n2004, New York, NY, updated in 2017. Please\nsee:\nhttps://www.coso.org/SitePages/Home.aspx).\n\nA-7\n\nCapital structure, mergers, asset sales, and\nother special transactions The capital\nstructure of a company is critical to\nshareholders as it impacts the value of their\ninvestment and the priority of their interest\nin the company relative to that of other\nequity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights\nare a key protection for shareholders against\nthe dilution of their interests. Effective\nvoting rights are basic rights of share\nownership and a core principle of effective\ngovernance. Shareholders, as the residual\nclaimants, have the strongest interest in\nprotecting the financial value of the company,\nand voting rights should match economic\nexposure, i.e. one share, one vote. In\nprinciple, we disagree with the creation of a\nshare class with equivalent economic exposure\nand preferential, differentiated voting\nrights. In our view, this structure violates\nthe fundamental corporate governance principle\nof proportionality and results in a\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few\nshareholders, thus disenfranchising other\nshareholders and amplifying any potential\nconflicts of interest. However, we recognize\nthat in certain markets, at least for a period\nof time, companies may have a valid argument\nfor listing dual classes of shares with\ndifferentiated voting rights. In our view,\nsuch companies should review these share class\nstructures on a regular basis or as company\ncircumstances change. Additionally, they\nshould seek shareholder approval of their\ncapital structure on a periodic basis via a\nmanagement proposal at the company\u2019s\nshareholder meeting. The proposal should give\nunaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to\naffirm the current structure or establish\nmechanisms to end or phase out controlling\nstructures at the appropriate time, while\nminimizing costs to shareholders. In assessing\nmergers, asset sales, or other special\ntransactions, BlackRock\u2019s primary\nconsideration is the long-term economic\ninterests of our clients as shareholders.\nBoards proposing a transaction should clearly\nexplain the economic and strategic rationale\nbehind it. We will review a proposed\ntransaction to determine the degree to which\nit can enhance long-term shareholder value. We\nfind long-term investors like our clients\ntypically benefit when proposed transactions\nhave the unanimous support of the board and\nhave been negotiated at arm\u2019s length. We may\nseek reassurance from the board that the\nfinancial interests of executives and/or board\nmembers in a given transaction have not\nadversely affected their ability to place\nshareholders\u2019 interests before their own.\nWhere the transaction involves related\nparties, the recommendation to support should\ncome from the independent directors, a best\npractice in most markets, and ideally, the\nterms should have been assessed through an\nindependent appraisal process. In addition, it\nis good practice that it be approved by a\nseparate vote of the non-conflicted parties.\nAs a matter of sound governance practice,\nshareholders should have a right to dispose of\ncompany shares in the open market without\nunnecessary restriction. In our view,\ncorporate mechanisms designed to limit\nshareholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares are\ncontrary to basic property rights. Such\nmechanisms can serve to protect and entrench\ninterests other than those of the\nshareholders. In our view, shareholders are\nbroadly capable of making decisions in their\nown best interests. We encourage any so-called\n\u201c shareholder rights plans \u201d proposed by a\nboard to be subject to shareholder approval\nupon introduction and periodically thereafter.\nExecutive compensation In most markets, one of\nthe most important roles for a company\u2019s board\nof directors is to put in place a compensation\nstructure that incentivizes and rewards\nexecutives appropriately. There should be a\nclear link between variable pay and\noperational and financial performance.\nPerformance metrics should be stretching and\naligned with a company\u2019s strategy and business\nmodel. BIS does not have a position on the use\nof sustainability-related criteria in\ncompensation structures, but in our view,\nwhere companies choose to include these\ncomponents, they should be adequately\ndisclosed, material to the company\u2019s strategy,\nand as rigorous as other financial or\noperational targets. Long-term incentive plans\nshould encompass timeframes that 1) are\ndistinct from annual executive compensation\nstructures and metrics, and 2) encourage the\ndelivery of strong financial results over a\nperiod of years. Compensation committees\nshould guard against contractual arrangements\nthat would entitle executives to material\ncompensation for early termination of their\nemployment. Finally, pension contributions and\nother deferred compensation arrangements\nshould be reasonable, in light of market\npractices. We are not supportive of one-off or\nspecial bonuses unrelated to company or\nindividual performance. Where discretion has\nbeen used by the compensation committee or its\nequivalent, we expect disclosure relating to\nhow and why the discretion was used, and how\nthe adjusted outcome is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders. We acknowledge that\nthe use of peer group evaluation by\ncompensation committees can help ensure\ncompetitive pay; however, we are concerned\nwhen the rationale for increases in total\ncompensation at a company is solely based on\npeer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous\nmeasure of outperformance. We encourage\ncompanies to clearly explain how compensation\noutcomes have rewarded performance.\n\nA-8\n\nWe encourage boards to consider building\nclawback provisions into incentive plans such\nthat companies could clawback compensation or\nrequire executives to forgo awards when\ncompensation was based on faulty financial\nstatements or deceptive business practices. We\nalso favor recoupment from or the foregoing of\nthe grant of any awards by any senior\nexecutive whose behavior caused material\nfinancial harm to shareholders, material\nreputational risk to the company, or resulted\nin a criminal investigation, even if such\nactions did not ultimately result in a\nmaterial restatement of past results. Non-\nexecutive directors should be compensated in a\nmanner that is commensurate with the time and\neffort expended in fulfilling their\nprofessional responsibilities. Additionally,\nthese compensation arrangements should not\nrisk compromising directors\u2019 independence or\naligning their interests too closely with\nthose of the management, whom they are charged\nwith overseeing. We use third party research,\nin addition to our own analysis, to evaluate\nexisting and proposed compensation structures.\nBIS may signal concerns through not supporting\nmanagement\u2019s proposals to approve\ncompensation, where they are on the agenda. We\nmay also vote against members of the\ncompensation committee or equivalent board\nmembers for poor compensation practices or\nstructures. Material sustainability-related\nrisks and opportunities It is our view that\nwell-managed companies will effectively\nevaluate and manage material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities relevant to\ntheir businesses. As with all risks and\nopportunities in a company's business model,\nappropriate oversight of material\nsustainability considerations is a core\ncomponent of having an effective governance\nframework, which supports durable, long-term\nfinancial value creation. Robust disclosure is\nessential for investors to effectively\nevaluate companies\u2019 strategy and business\npractices related to material sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Long-term\ninvestors like our clients can benefit when\ncompanies demonstrate that they have a\nresilient business model through disclosures\nthat cover governance, strategy, risk\nmanagement, and metrics and targets, including\nindustry-specific metrics. The International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\nstandards, IFRS S1 and S2, 4 provide companies\nwith a useful guide to preparing this\ndisclosure. The standards build on the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics\ndeveloped by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (SASB), which have converged\nunder the ISSB. We recognize that companies\nmay phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB\nstandards over several years. We also\nrecognize that some companies may report using\ndifferent standards, which may be required by\nregulation, or one of a number of voluntary\nstandards. In such cases, we ask that\ncompanies highlight the metrics that are\nindustry- or company-specific. We note that\nclimate and other sustainability-related\ndisclosures often require companies to collect\nand aggregate data from various internal and\nexternal sources. We recognize that the\npractical realities of data collection and\nreporting may not line up with financial\nreporting cycles and companies may require\nadditional time after their fiscal year-end to\naccurately collect, analyze, and report this\ndata to investors. That said, to give\ninvestors time to assess the data, we\nencourage companies to produce climate and\nother sustainability-related disclosures\nsufficiently in advance of their annual\nmeeting, to the best of their abilities.\nCompanies may also choose to adopt or refer to\nguidance on sustainable and responsible\nbusiness conduct issued by supranational\norganizations such as the United Nations or\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment. Further, industry initiatives on\nmanaging specific operational risks may\nprovide useful guidance to companies on best\npractices and disclosures. We find it helpful\nto our understanding of investment risk when\ncompanies disclose any relevant global climate\nand other sustainability-related standards\nadopted, the industry initiatives in which\nthey participate, any peer group benchmarking\nundertaken, and any assurance processes to\nhelp investors understand their approach to\nsustainable and responsible business\npractices. We will express any concerns\nthrough our voting where a company\u2019s actions\nor disclosures do not seem adequate in light\nof the materiality of the business risks.\nClimate and nature-related risk While\ncompanies in various sectors and geographies\nmay be affected differently by climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the low-carbon\ntransition is an investment factor that can be\nmaterial for many companies and economies\naround the globe.\n\n4 The objective of IFRS S1 General\nRequirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-\nrelated Financial Information is to require an\nentity to disclose information about its\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities\nthat is useful to primary users of general-\npurpose financial reports in making decisions\nrelating to providing resources to the entity.\nThe objective of IFRS S2 Climate-related\nDisclosures is to require an entity to\ndisclose information about its climate-related\nrisks and opportunities that is useful to\nprimary users of general-purpose financial\nreports in making decisions relating to\nproviding resources to the entity.\n\nA-9\n\nWe seek to understand, from company\ndisclosures and engagement, the strategies\ncompanies have in place to manage material\nrisks to, and opportunities for, their long-\nterm business model associated with a range of\nclimate-related scenarios, including a\nscenario in which global warming is limited to\nwell below 2\u00b0C, considering global ambitions\nto achieve a limit of 1.5\u00b0C. As one of many\nshareholders, and typically a minority one,\nBlackRock does not tell companies what to do.\nIt is the role of the board and management to\nset and implement a company's long-term\nstrategy to deliver long-term financial\nreturns. Our research shows that the low-\ncarbon transition is a structural shift in the\nglobal economy that will be shaped by changes\nin government policies, technology, and\nconsumer preferences, which may be material\nfor many companies. 5 Yet the path to a low-\ncarbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven,\nwith different parts of the economy moving at\ndifferent speeds. BIS recognizes that it can\nbe challenging for companies to predict the\nimpact of climate-related risk and opportunity\non their businesses and operating\nenvironments. Many companies are assessing how\nto navigate the low-carbon transition while\ndelivering long-term value to investors. In\nthis context, we encourage companies to\npublicly disclose, consistent with their\nbusiness model and sector, how they intend to\ndeliver long-term financial performance\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Where available, we appreciate\ncompanies publishing their transition plan. 6\nConsistent with the ISSB standards, we are\nbetter able to assess preparedness for the\nlow-carbon transition when companies disclose\nshort-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally\nscience-based where these are available for\ntheir sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate\nhow their targets are consistent with the\nlong-term financial interests of their\ninvestors. While we recognize that regulators\nin some markets are moving to mandate certain\ndisclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3\nemissions differently from scopes 1 and 2,\ngiven methodological complexity, regulatory\nuncertainty, concerns about double-counting,\nand lack of direct control by companies. We\nwelcome disclosures and commitments companies\nchoose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and\nrecognize these are provided on a good-faith\nbasis as methodology develops. Our publicly\navailable commentary provides more information\non our approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In addition to climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, the management of\nnature-related factors is increasingly a\ncomponent of some companies\u2019 ability to\ngenerate durable, long-term financial returns\nfor shareholders, particularly where a\ncompany\u2019s strategy is heavily reliant on the\navailability of natural capital, or whose\nsupply chains are exposed to locations with\nnature-related risks. We look for such\ncompanies to disclose how they manage any\nreliance and impact on, as well as use of,\nnatural capital, including appropriate risk\noversight and relevant metrics and targets, to\nunderstand how these factors are integrated\ninto strategy. We will evaluate these\ndisclosures to inform our view of how a\ncompany is managing material nature-related\nrisks and opportunities, as well as in our\nassessment of relevant shareholder proposals.\nOur publicly available commentary provides\nmore information on our approach to natural\ncapital. 7 Key stakeholder interests In order\nto advance long-term shareholders\u2019 interests,\ncompanies should consider the interests of the\nvarious parties on whom they depend for their\nsuccess over time. It is for each company to\ndetermine their key stakeholders based on what\nis material to their business and long-term\nfinancial performance. For many companies, key\nstakeholders include employees, business\npartners (such as suppliers and distributors),\nclients and consumers, regulators, and the\ncommunities in which they operate. As a long-\nterm shareholder on behalf of our clients, we\nfind it helpful when companies disclose how\nthey have identified their key stakeholders\nand considered their interests in business\ndecision-making. In addition to understanding\nbroader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds\nit helpful when companies consider the needs\nof their workforce today, and the skills\nrequired for their future business strategy.\nWe are also interested to understand the role\nof the board, which is well positioned to\nensure that the approach taken is informed by\nand aligns with the company\u2019s strategy and\npurpose.\n\n5 BlackRock Investment Institute, \u201c Tracking\nthe low-carbon transition \u201d , July 2023. 6 We\nhave observed that more companies are\ndeveloping such plans, and public policy\nmakers in a number of markets are signaling\ntheir intentions to require them. We view\ntransition plans (TPs) as a method for a\ncompany to both internally assess and\nexternally communicate long-term strategy,\nambition, objectives, and actions to create\nfinancial value through the global transition\ntowards a low-carbon economy. While many\ninitiatives across jurisdictions outline a\nframework for TPs, there is no consensus on\nthe key elements these plans should contain.\nWe view useful disclosure as that which\ncommunicates a company\u2019s approach to managing\nfinancially material, business relevant risks\nand opportunities \u2013 including climate-related\nrisks \u2013 to deliver long-term financial\nperformance, thus enabling investors to make\nmore informed decisions. 7 Given the growing\nawareness of the materiality of these issues\nfor certain businesses, enhanced reporting on\na company's natural capital dependencies and\nimpacts would aid investors\u2019 understanding. In\nour view, the final recommendations of the\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures may prove useful to some\ncompanies. We recognize that some companies\nmay report using different standards, which\nmay be required by regulation, or one of a\nnumber of other private sector standards.\n\nA-10\n\nCompanies should articulate how they address\nmaterial adverse impacts that could arise from\ntheir business practices and affect critical\nrelationships with their stakeholders. We\nencourage companies to implement, to the\nextent appropriate, monitoring processes\n(often referred to as due diligence) to\nidentify and mitigate potential adverse\nimpacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate\nany actual adverse material impacts. In our\nview, maintaining trust within these\nrelationships can contribute to a company\u2019s\nlong-term success. Other corporate governance\nmatters and shareholder protections In our\nview, shareholders have a right to material\nand timely information on the financial\nperformance and viability of the companies in\nwhich they invest. In addition, companies\nshould publish information on the governance\nstructures in place and the rights of\nshareholders to influence these structures.\nThe reporting and disclosure provided by\ncompanies help shareholders assess the\neffectiveness of the board\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement and whether investors\u2019 economic\ninterests have been protected. We believe\nshareholders should have the right to vote on\nkey corporate governance matters, including\nchanges to governance mechanisms, to submit\nproposals to the shareholders\u2019 meeting, and to\ncall special meetings of shareholders.\nCorporate form In our view, it is the\nresponsibility of the board to determine the\ncorporate form that is most appropriate given\nthe company\u2019s purpose and business model. 8\nCompanies proposing to change their corporate\nform to a public benefit corporation or\nsimilar entity should put it to a shareholder\nvote if not already required to do so under\napplicable law. Supporting documentation from\ncompanies or shareholder proponents proposing\nto alter the corporate form should clearly\narticulate how the interests of shareholders\nand different stakeholders would be impacted\nas well as the accountability and voting\nmechanisms that would be available to\nshareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of\nclients, we generally support management\nproposals if our analysis indicates that\nshareholders\u2019 economic interests are\nadequately protected. Relevant shareholder\nproposals are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. Shareholder proposals In most markets\nin which BlackRock invests on behalf of\nclients, shareholders have the right to submit\nproposals to be voted on by shareholders at a\ncompany\u2019s annual or extraordinary meeting, as\nlong as eligibility and procedural\nrequirements are met. The matters that we see\nput forward by shareholders address a wide\nrange of topics, including governance reforms,\ncapital management, and improvements in the\nmanagement or disclosure of sustainability-\nrelated risks. BlackRock is subject to legal\nand regulatory requirements in the U.S. that\nplace restrictions and limitations on how\nBlackRock can interact with the companies in\nwhich we invest on behalf of our clients,\nincluding our ability to submit shareholder\nproposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients\nwho authorize us to do so, on proposals put\nforth by others. When assessing shareholder\nproposals, we evaluate each proposal on its\nmerit, with a singular focus on its\nimplications for long-term financial value\ncreation by that company. We believe it is\nhelpful for companies to disclose the names of\nthe proponent or organization that has\nsubmitted or advised on the proposal. We\nconsider the business and economic relevance\nof the issue raised, as well as its\nmateriality and the urgency with which our\nexperience indicates it should be addressed.\nWe would not support proposals that we believe\nwould result in over-reaching into the basic\nbusiness decisions of the company. We take\ninto consideration the legal effect of the\nproposal, as shareholder proposals may be\nadvisory or legally binding depending on the\njurisdiction, while others may make requests\nthat would be deemed illegal in a given\njurisdiction. Where a proposal is focused on a\nmaterial business risk that we agree needs to\nbe addressed and the intended outcome is\nconsistent with long-term financial value\ncreation, we will look to the board and\nmanagement to demonstrate that the company has\nmet the intent of the request made in the\nshareholder proposal. Where our analysis\nand/or engagement indicate an opportunity for\nimprovement in the company\u2019s approach to the\nissue, we may support shareholder proposals\nthat are reasonable and not unduly\nprescriptive or constraining on management. We\nrecognize that some shareholder proposals\nbundle topics and/or specific requests and\ninclude supporting statements that explain the\nreasoning or objectives of the proponent. In\nvoting on behalf of clients, we do not submit\nor edit proposals or the supporting statements\n\u2013 we must vote yes or no on the proposal as\nphrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we\nvote in support of a proposal, we are not\nnecessarily endorsing every element of the\nproposal or the reasoning, objectives, or\nsupporting statement of the proponent. We may\nsupport a proposal for different reasons from\nthose put forth by the proponent, when we\nbelieve that, overall, it can advance our\nclients' long-term financial interests. We\nwould normally explain to the company our\nrationale for supporting such proposals.\n\n8 Corporate form refers to the legal structure\nby which a business is organized.\n\nA-11\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, we may vote\nagainst the election of one or more directors\nif, in our assessment, the board has not\nresponded sufficiently or with an appropriate\nsense of urgency. We may also support a\nproposal if management is on track, but we\nbelieve that voting in favor might accelerate\nefforts to address a material risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s oversight of its investment\nstewardship activities Oversight BlackRock\nmaintains three regional advisory committees\n(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the\nAmericas; b) Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally\nconsisting of senior BlackRock investment\nprofessionals and/or senior employees with\npractical boardroom experience. The regional\nStewardship Advisory Committees review and\nadvise on amendments to BIS regional proxy\nvoting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering\nmarkets within each respective region. The\nadvisory committees do not determine voting\ndecisions, which are the responsibility of\nBIS. In addition to the regional Stewardship\nAdvisory Committees, the Investment\nStewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global\nOversight Committee) is a risk-focused\ncommittee, comprised of senior representatives\nfrom various BlackRock investment teams, a\nsenior legal representative, the Global Head\nof Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and\nother senior executives with relevant\nexperience and team oversight. The Global\nCommittee does not determine voting decisions,\nwhich are the responsibility of BIS. The\nGlobal Head has primary oversight of the\nactivities of BIS, including voting in\naccordance with the Guidelines, which require\nthe application of professional judgment and\nconsideration of each company\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The Global Committee reviews\nand approves amendments to these Principles.\nThe Global Committee also reviews and approves\namendments to the regional Guidelines, as\nproposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory\nCommittees. In addition, the Global Committee\nreceives and reviews periodic reports\nregarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as\nupdates on material process issues, procedural\nchanges, and other risk oversight\nconsiderations. The Global Committee reviews\nthese reports in an oversight capacity as\ninformed by the Guidelines. BIS carries out\nengagement with companies, executes proxy\nvotes, and conducts vote operations (including\nmaintaining records of votes cast) in a manner\nconsistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS\nalso conducts research on corporate governance\nissues and participates in industry\ndiscussions to contribute to and keep abreast\nof important developments in the corporate\ngovernance field. BIS may utilize third\nparties for certain of the foregoing\nactivities and performs oversight of those\nthird parties. BIS may raise complicated or\nparticularly controversial matters for\ninternal discussion with the relevant\ninvestment teams and governance specialists\nfor discussion and guidance prior to making a\nvoting decision. Vote execution BlackRock\nvotes on proxy issues when our clients\nauthorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been\nauthorized to vote on behalf of our clients,\nwe carefully consider proxies submitted to\nfunds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or\nFunds) for which we have voting authority.\nBlackRock votes (or refrains from voting)\nproxies for each Fund for which we have voting\nauthority based on our evaluation of the\nalignment of the voting items with the long-\nterm economic interests of our clients, in the\nexercise of our independent business judgment,\nand without regard to the relationship of the\nissuer of the proxy (or any shareholder\nproponent or dissident shareholder) to the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s affiliates (if any),\nBlackRock or BlackRock\u2019s affiliates, or\nBlackRock employees (see \u201c Conflicts\nmanagement policies and procedures, \u201d below).\nWhen exercising voting rights, BIS will\nnormally vote on specific proxy issues in\naccordance with the Guidelines for the\nrelevant market, as well as the Global\nPrinciples. The Guidelines are reviewed\nannually and are amended consistent with\nchanges in the local market practice, as\ndevelopments in corporate governance occur, or\nas otherwise deemed advisable by the\napplicable Stewardship Advisory Committees.\nBIS analysts may, in the exercise of their\nprofessional judgment, conclude that the\nGuidelines do not cover the specific matter\nupon which a proxy vote is required or that an\nexception to the Guidelines would be in the\nlong-term economic interests of BlackRock\u2019s\nclients. In the uncommon circumstance of there\nbeing a vote with respect to fixed income\nsecurities or the securities of privately held\nissuers, the decision generally will be made\nby a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS\nbased on an assessment of the particular\ntransactions or other matters at issue. In\ncertain markets, proxy voting involves\nlogistical issues which can affect BIS\u2019\nability to vote such proxies, as well as the\ndesirability of voting such proxies. These\nissues include, but are not limited to: i)\nuntimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii)\nrestrictions on a foreigner\u2019s ability to\nexercise votes; iii) requirements to vote\nproxies in person; iv) \u201c share-blocking \u201d\n(requirements that investors who exercise\ntheir voting rights surrender the right to\ndispose of their holdings for some specified\nperiod in proximity to the shareholder\nmeeting); v) potential difficulties in\ntranslating the proxy; vi) regulatory\n\nA-12\n\nconstraints; and vii) requirements to provide\nlocal agents with unrestricted powers of\nattorney to facilitate voting instructions. We\nare not supportive of impediments to the\nexercise of voting rights such as share-\nblocking or overly burdensome administrative\nrequirements. As a consequence, BlackRock\nvotes proxies in these situations on a \u201c best-\nefforts \u201d basis. In addition, BIS may\ndetermine that it is generally in the\ninterests of BlackRock\u2019s clients not to vote\nproxies (or not to vote our full allocation)\nif the costs (including but not limited to\nopportunity costs associated with share-\nblocking constraints) associated with\nexercising a vote are expected to outweigh the\nbenefit the client would derive by voting on\nthe proposal. Active portfolio managers have\nfull discretion to vote the shares in the\nFunds they manage based on their analysis of\nthe economic impact of a particular ballot\nitem on their investors. Portfolio managers\nmay, from time to time, reach differing views\non how to maximize economic value with respect\nto a particular investment. Therefore,\nportfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote\nshares in the Funds under their management\ndifferently from BIS or from one another.\nHowever, because BlackRock\u2019s clients are\nmostly long-term investors with long-term\neconomic goals, ballots are generally cast in\na uniform manner. Voting Choice BlackRock\noffers a Voting Choice program, which provides\neligible clients with more opportunities to\nparticipate in the proxy voting process where\nlegally and operationally viable. BlackRock\nVoting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier\nand more accessible for eligible clients.\nVoting Choice is currently available for\neligible clients invested in certain\ninstitutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK,\nIreland, and Canada that utilize equity index\ninvestment strategies, as well as eligible\nclients in certain institutional pooled funds\nin the U.S., UK, and Canada that use\nsystematic active equity (SAE) strategies.\nCurrently, this includes over 650 pooled\ninvestment funds, including equity index funds\nand SAE investment funds. In addition,\ninstitutional clients in separately managed\naccounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for\nBlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their\ninvestment strategies. 9 As a result, the\nshares attributed to BlackRock in company\nshare registers may be voted differently\ndepending on whether our clients have\nauthorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have\nauthorized BIS to vote in accordance with a\nthird-party policy, or have elected to vote\nshares in accordance with their own policy.\nAgreements with our clients to allow them\ngreater control over their voting, including\nwhich policies they have selected, will be\ntreated confidentially consistent with our\ntreatment of similar client agreements.\nConflicts management policies and procedures\nBIS maintains policies and procedures that\nseek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock\u2019s\nproxy voting activity. Such influence might\nstem from any relationship between the\ninvestee company (or any shareholder proponent\nor dissident shareholder) and BlackRock,\nBlackRock\u2019s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund\u2019s\naffiliates, or BlackRock employees. The\nfollowing are examples of sources of perceived\nor potential conflicts of interest: \u2022\nBlackRock clients who may be issuers of\nsecurities or proponents of shareholder\nresolutions \u2022 BlackRock business partners or\nthird parties who may be issuers of securities\nor proponents of shareholder resolutions \u2022\nBlackRock employees who may sit on the boards\nof public companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 Significant BlackRock, Inc.\ninvestors who may be issuers of securities\nheld in Funds managed by BlackRock \u2022\nSecurities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock\ninvestment funds held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock \u2022 BlackRock, Inc. board members who\nserve as senior executives or directors of\npublic companies held in Funds managed by\nBlackRock BlackRock has taken certain steps to\nmitigate perceived or potential conflicts\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to\nadvance our clients\u2019 long-term economic\ninterests in the companies in which BlackRock\ninvests on their behalf \u2022 Established a\nreporting structure that separates BIS from\nemployees with sales, vendor management, or\nbusiness partnership roles. In addition,\nBlackRock seeks to ensure that all engagements\nwith corporate issuers, dissident shareholders\nor shareholder proponents are managed\nconsistently and without regard to BlackRock\u2019s\nrelationship with such parties. Clients or\nbusiness partners are not given special\ntreatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS\nprioritizes engagements based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, our need for\nadditional information to make a voting\n\n9 Read more about BlackRock Voting Choice on\nour website .\n\nA-13\n\ndecision or our view on the likelihood that an\nengagement could lead to positive outcome(s)\nover time for the economic value of the\ncompany. Within the normal course of business,\nBIS may engage directly with BlackRock\nclients, business partners and/or third\nparties, and/or with employees with sales,\nvendor management, or business partnership\nroles, in discussions regarding our approach\nto stewardship, general corporate governance\nmatters, client reporting needs, and/or to\notherwise ensure that proxy-related client\nservice levels are met \u2022 Determined to engage,\nin certain instances, an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations as a further safeguard\nto avoid potential conflicts of interest, to\nsatisfy regulatory compliance requirements, or\nas may be otherwise required by applicable\nlaw. In such circumstances, the independent\nthird-party voting service provider provides\nBlackRock with recommendations, in accordance\nwith the Guidelines, as to how to vote such\nproxies. BlackRock uses an independent third-\nparty voting service provider to make proxy\nvoting recommendations for shares of\nBlackRock, Inc. and companies affiliated with\nBlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an\nindependent third-party voting service\nprovider to make proxy voting recommendations\nfor: \u2022 public companies that include BlackRock\nemployees on their boards of directors \u2022\npublic companies of which a BlackRock, Inc.\nboard member serves as a senior executive or a\nmember of the board of directors \u2022 public\ncompanies that are the subject of certain\ntransactions involving BlackRock Funds \u2022\npublic companies that are joint venture\npartners with BlackRock, and \u2022 public\ncompanies when legal or regulatory\nrequirements compel BlackRock to use an\nindependent third-party voting service\nprovider In selecting an independent third-\nparty voting service provider, we assess\nseveral characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: independence, an ability to\nanalyze proxy issues and make recommendations\nin the economic interest of our clients in\naccordance with the Guidelines, reputation for\nreliability and integrity, and operational\ncapacity to accurately deliver the assigned\nrecommendations in a timely manner. We may\nengage more than one independent third-party\nvoting service provider, in part to mitigate\npotential or perceived conflicts of interest\nat a single voting service provider. The\nGlobal Committee appoints and reviews the\nperformance of the independent third-party\nvoting service providers, generally on an\nannual basis. Securities lending When so\nauthorized, BlackRock acts as a securities\nlending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities\nlending is a well-regulated practice that\ncontributes to capital market efficiency. It\nalso enables funds to generate additional\nreturns while allowing fund providers to keep\nfund expenses lower. With regard to the\nrelationship between securities lending and\nproxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on\nloan and may determine to recall them for\nvoting, as guided by our fiduciary\nresponsibility to act in our clients\u2019\nfinancial interests. While this has occurred\nin a limited number of cases, the decision to\nrecall securities on loan as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s securities lending program in\norder to vote is based on an evaluation of\nvarious factors that include, but are not\nlimited to, assessing potential securities\nlending revenue alongside the potential long-\nterm financial value to clients of voting\nthose securities (based on the information\navailable at the time of recall\nconsideration). 10 BIS works with colleagues\nin the Securities Lending and Risk and\nQuantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the\ncosts and benefits to clients of recalling\nshares on loan. In almost all instances,\nBlackRock anticipates that the potential long-\nterm financial value to the Fund of voting\nshares would be less than the potential\nrevenue the loan may provide the Fund.\nHowever, in certain instances, BlackRock may\ndetermine, in our independent business\njudgment as a fiduciary, that the value of\nvoting outweighs the securities lending\nrevenue loss to clients and would therefore\nrecall shares to be voted in those instances.\nPeriodically, BlackRock reviews our process\nfor determining whether to recall securities\non loan in order to vote and may modify it as\nnecessary. Voting guidelines\n\n10 Recalling securities on loan can be\nimpacted by the timing of record dates. In the\nU.S., for example, the record date of a\nshareholder meeting typically falls before the\nproxy statements are released. Accordingly, it\nis not practicable to evaluate a proxy\nstatement, determine that a vote has a\nmaterial impact on a fund and recall any\nshares on loan in advance of the record date\nfor the annual meeting. As a result, managers\nmust weigh independent business judgement as a\nfiduciary, the benefit to a fund\u2019s\nshareholders of recalling loaned shares in\nadvance of an estimated record date without\nknowing whether there will be a vote on\nmatters which have a material impact on the\nfund (thereby forgoing potential securities\nlending revenue for the fund\u2019s shareholders)\nor leaving shares on loan to potentially earn\nrevenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the\nopportunity to vote).\n\nA-14\n\nThe voting guidelines published for each\nregion/country in which we vote are intended\nto summarize BlackRock\u2019s general philosophy\nand approach to issues that may commonly arise\nin the proxy voting context in each market\nwhere we invest. The Guidelines are not\nintended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the\nGuidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the\ncontext of the individual circumstances of\neach company and the specific issue under\nreview. As such, the Guidelines do not\nindicate how BIS will vote in every instance.\nRather, they reflect our view about corporate\ngovernance issues generally, and provide\ninsight into how we typically approach issues\nthat commonly arise on corporate ballots. As\npreviously discussed, the Guidelines should be\nread in conjunction with the Principles and\nengagement priorities. Collectively, these \u201c\nBIS policies \u201d set out the core elements of\ncorporate governance that guide our investment\nstewardship efforts globally and within each\nmarket, including when engaging with companies\nand voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS\npolicies are applied on a case-by-case basis,\ntaking into consideration the context within\nwhich a company is operating. Reporting and\nvote transparency We are committed to\ntransparency in the stewardship work we do on\nbehalf of clients. We inform clients about our\nengagement and voting policies and activities\nthrough direct communication and through\ndisclosure on our website. Each year we\npublish an annual report that provides a\nglobal overview of our investment stewardship\nengagement and voting activities and a voting\nspotlight that summarizes our voting over a\nproxy year. 11 Additionally, we make public\nour regional proxy voting guidelines for the\nbenefit of clients and the companies in which\nwe invest on their behalf. We also publish\ncommentaries to share our perspective on\nmarket developments and emerging key themes.\nAt a more granular level, on a quarterly\nbasis, we publish our vote record for each\ncompany that held a shareholder meeting during\nthe period, showing how BIS voted on each\nproposal and providing our rationale for any\nvotes against management proposals or on\nshareholder proposals.
