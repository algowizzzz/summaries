As a result, the last day of\ntrading in the Fund on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc.\n(\u0093Cboe BZX\u0094) will be December 2, 2024. Cboe\nBZX will suspend trading in the Fund before\nthe open of trading on December 3, 2024, and\nshares\nof the Fund will no longer be available for\nnew investments as of this date. Proceeds of\nthe liquidation are currently scheduled to be\nsent to shareholders on December 5, 2024. The\nFund\u0092s final net asset value, as calculated on\nDecember 2, 2024, will include any costs\nassociated with the liquidation expected to be\nborne by the Fund.\n\nBecause shares of the Fund will not be traded\non\nCboe BZX during the period between December 3,\n2024 and December 5, 2024, we cannot assure\nyou that there will be a trading market for\nyour shares. Further, during this period, the\nFund will be in the process of closing down\nand\nliquidating its portfolio, which may result in\nthe Fund not being able to track its\nUnderlying Index (by December 3, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index value will be represented\nalmost entirely by cash as no securities will\nremain in the Underlying\nIndex). After December 2, 2024, shareholders\nthat remain invested in the Fund will receive\nthe entire amount of their pro rata share of\nthe liquidation proceeds on or about December\n5, 2024, subject to their brokerage firm\u0092s\nprocesses.\n\nShareholders may sell their holdings of the\nFund prior to December 3, 2024 and may incur\nthe usual and customary brokerage commissions\nassociated\nwith the sale of Fund shares. If you still\nhold shares of the Fund on December 5, 2024,\nthe Fund will automatically redeem your shares\nfor cash based on the net asset value as of\nthe close of business on December 2, 2024,\nwhich will\ninclude any dividends or distributions\ncalculated as of that date.\n\nIf you are subject to federal income tax, the\nliquidation of the Fund will result in one or\nmore\ntaxable events for you. A sale or exchange of\nFund shares prior to the liquidation will\ngenerally give rise to a capital gain or loss\nto you for federal income tax purposes. In\nconnection with the liquidation, the Fund may\ndeclare tax exempt or\ntaxable distributions of its investment income\nand/or taxable distributions of its net\ncapital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to\nyou should generally be treated as received by\nyou in exchange for your shares and will\ntherefore generally give\nrise to a capital gain or loss depending on\nyour tax basis. Please refer to the \u0093Taxes\u0094\n\ndisclosure beginning on page 68 of the SAI and\nconsult your own tax advisor about the\npotential tax consequences of the Fund\u0092s\nliquidation, including any state, local,\nforeign or other tax\nconsequences.\n\nIf you have any questions, please call\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\n\niShares is a registered trademark of BlackRock\nFund Advisors or its affiliates.\n\nIS-A-IBMM-1024\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT\n\nFOR FUTURE REFERENCE\n"
