Energy usage is\ndefined as the estimated energy usage,\nmeasured in kilowatt hours per square foot, of\nnet leasable area owned by an issuer. A third-\nparty data provider estimates energy usage\nbased on factors including building location\nand size, primary property type, year built\nand time period of estimation. The carbon\nemission intensity metric is calculated based\non total carbon emissions, measured in metric\ntons of carbon dioxide-equivalent, for the\nbuildings owned by the issuer. A third-party\ndata provider estimates Scope 1, 2 and 3\nemissions, which include both landlord and\ntenant emissions, for each building based on\nthe types of energy used by similar types of\nbuildings in the geographic area. Scope 1\nemissions are direct greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d)\nemissions from fuels that are used by a\nbuilding on\u2011site. Scope 2 emissions are\nemissions from fuels that are burned off\u2011site\nto deliver energy to a building, mainly\nemissions from electricity use. Scope 3\nemissions are other emissions that an issuer\ngenerates indirectly, such as emissions from\ntenants, transportation, waste generation and\ndisposal, supply chain, and purchased\nproducts. The emissions are then scaled by the\nissuer\u2019s enterprise value including cash\n(i.e., the sum of market capitalization at\nfiscal year\u2011end, preferred stock, minority\ninterests, total debt, and cash and cash\nequivalents). The seventh paragraph of the\nsection entitled \u201cPrincipal Investment\nStrategies\u201d of the Summary Prospectus and\nProspectus shall be deleted in its entirety\nand replaced with the following: The\nUnderlying Index is reviewed and reconstituted\nannually in September, with the business\ninvolvement and UNGC controversy screens\napplied quarterly. Change to the Fund\u2019s\n\u201cConstruction and Maintenance of the\nUnderlying Indexes\u201d The section entitled \u201cFTSE\nEPRA Nareit Developed Green Target Index\u201d on\npages 31\u201132 of the SAI shall be deleted in its\nentirety and replaced with the following: FTSE\nEPRA Nareit Developed Green Target Index\nNumber of Components: approximately 352 Index\nDescription.The FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed\nGreen Target Index is an equity index designed\nto reflect the performance of securities from\nthe FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index (the\n\u201cParent Index\u201d) that are weighted to target\nimproved sustainability-related metrics\nrelative to the Parent Index, subject to\ncertain constraints. The Parent Index is\ncomposed of REITs and real estate holding and\ndevelopment companies from developed market\ncountries or regions and may include large-,\nmid\u2011 and small-capitalization constituents.\nIndex Methodology.The Index Provider begins\nwith the Parent Index and excludes the\nsecurities of issuers that it identifies as\nbeing involved in any of the business\nactivities summarized below:\n                                              \n       Manufacturing tobacco products (e.g.,  \n       cigarettes, roll your own tobacco,     \n  \u00b7    pipe tobacco, cigars, cigarillos,      \n       bidis, gutka, smokeless tobacco,       \n       heated tobacco products, electronic    \n       cigarettes and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  electronic nicotine delivery systems); or   \n  deriving                                    \n  5% or more revenue from providing           \n  tobacco-related                             \n  products or services or from the supply,    \n  distribution and/or retail sale of tobacco  \n  products.                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Producing and selling assault          \n       weapons, other firearms or key         \n       components of any such weapons to      \n  \u00b7    civilian customers; or deriving 5% or  \n       more revenue from the distribution     \n       and/or retail sale of assault weapons  \n       or other firearms.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Producing the core weapon system of    \n       chemical or biological weapons,        \n       cluster munitions, anti-personnel      \n       mines, nuclear weapons, depleted       \n       uranium weapons or white phosphorus    \n       weapons (collectively, \u201ccontroversial  \n  \u00b7    weapons\u201d); providing components or     \n       services for the core weapon system    \n       of controversial weapons, even if not  \n       essential for lethal use of the        \n       weapon; or having 20% or more voting   \n       rights in a company involved in such   \n       activities related to controversial    \n       weapons.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Deriving 5% or more revenue from       \n  \u00b7    extracting oil sands, mining thermal   \n       coal or generating electricity from    \n       thermal coal.                          \n                                              \nAdditionally, the Index Provider excludes\ncompanies that it determines are involved in\ncontroversies related to the ten United\nNations Global Compact (\u201cUNGC\u201d) principles,\nwhich are classified into four categories:\nhuman rights, labor, environment and anti-\ncorruption. After applying the exclusion\nscreens, the Index Provider weights the\nremaining securities to target, in aggregate\nacross the Underlying Index, (i) a minimum of\n10% green certification; (ii) a 30% increase\nin green certification relative to the Parent\nIndex; (iii) a 10% reduction in energy usage\nrelative to the Parent Index; and (iv) a level\nof carbon emission intensity that is no worse\nthan that of the Parent Index. Green\ncertification is defined as the percentage of\nbuilding area owned by an issuer that has a\nLEED or BREEAM certification, as confirmed by\na third-party data provider. Energy usage is\ndefined as the estimated energy usage,\nmeasured in kilowatt hours per square foot, of\nnet leasable area owned by an issuer. A third-\nparty data provider estimates energy usage\nbased on factors including building location\nand size, primary property type, year built\nand time period of estimation. The carbon\nemission intensity metric is calculated based\non total carbon emissions, measured in metric\ntons of carbon dioxide-equivalent, for the\nbuildings owned by the issuer. A third-party\ndata provider estimates Scope 1, 2 and 3\nemissions, which include both landlord and\ntenant emissions, for each building based on\nthe types of energy used by similar types of\nbuildings in the geographic area. Scope 1\nemissions are direct greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d)\nemissions from fuels that are used by a\nbuilding on\u2011site. Scope 2 emissions are\nemissions from fuels that are burned off\u2011site\nto deliver energy to a building, mainly\nemissions from electricity use. Scope 3\nemissions are other emissions that an issuer\ngenerates indirectly, such as emissions from\ntenants, transportation, waste generation and\ndisposal, supply chain, and purchased\nproducts. The emissions are then scaled by the\nissuer\u2019s enterprise value including cash\n(i.e., the sum of market capitalization at\nfiscal year\u2011end, preferred stock, minority\ninterests, total debt, and cash and cash\nequivalents). The Underlying Index must have a\nbeta (a measure of volatility relative to the\noverall market) between 0.7 and 1.3 relative\nto the Parent Index, using daily returns over\nthe past two years. In addition, the\nUnderlying Index\u2019s country and sector exposure\nmust be within 1% of the Parent Index weight.\nThe minimum weight for an individual\nconstituent is 0.005% of the Underlying Index,\nand the maximum weight is the lesser of 10% of\nthe Underlying Index or 10 times the\nconstituent\u2019s weight in the Parent Index. At\neach index review, the sector and country\nconstraints and the green certification and\nenergy usage targets may be relaxed if it is\ninfeasible to achieve all constraints and\ntargets. The first step is to relax the\ncountry and sector constraints in 2%\nincrements, up to +/- 10% of the Parent Index.\nIf there is still no solution, the green\ncertification and energy usage targets will be\nrelaxed iteratively in 2.5% increments until a\nsolution is reached. The Underlying Index will\nbe reviewed and reconstituted annually in\nSeptember, with the business involvement and\nUNGC controversy screens applied quarterly.\niShares \u00aeis a registered trademark of\nBlackRock Fund Advisors and its affiliates.\nIS\u2011A\u2011SUPP\u2011ERET\u20110924 PLEASE RETAIN THIS\nSUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE\n"
